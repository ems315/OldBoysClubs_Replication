It wasn’t until two years after graduation that I discovered that I was meant for advertising. It has given me some fame, some fortune, some wonderful friends—and plenty of excitement. I began with a small Boston agency, and during the war I was lucky enough to write “The Kid in Upper Four” for the New Haven Railroad. This won me one of advertising’s top awards, the attention of many famous people and job offers from top-flight agencies. I left Boston and joined McCann-Erickson in New York. Here for twelve years I wrote for Canadian National Railways, Bulova, Schenley, Chrysler, Gruen, Pepsodent and many others. At this point I had made enough rich people richer so that the job offers began again. I eventually ended up working with a Yale man, C. J. LaRoche, where I am a vice-president in the copy department and member of the Plans Board, working on Revlon, Canadian Club, Norelco and Royal McBee among others",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,495.0,,,Carly Sagers,0,,1935

Upon graduation, I interned at Boston City and Cambridge City Hospitals and then became resident physician at Childrens Hospital, Washington, District of Columbia. After a year of private practice in Somerville, Massachusetts, where I had reopened my father’s office, I decided to make the Regular Navy my career. Aviation and its medical research appealed to me so I applied for flight training and, upon its completion, was designated Flight Surgeon No. 8 in 1939. Then followed a rotation of service aboard aircraft carriers and in Naval and Marine Corps air stations, each duty more challenging than the previous.

Duty on board ship also gave many opportunities to study individual problems of a psychological nature. The old slogan “Join the Navy and See the World” was most applicable in my case, for I covered both Atlantic and Pacific Oceans very thoroughly. The war years were very exciting, We took part in the invasions of the central Pacific campaigns from the attack on Marcus to the landings on the Marianas.

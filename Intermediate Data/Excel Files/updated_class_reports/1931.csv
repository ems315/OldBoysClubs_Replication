We had no reservations throughout the tenweek 15,000-mile trip except at Franny Hoague’s house in Scattle, where we spent the night on the lawn. Also we stopped to see Dick Edwards in Yakima, Washington.

I probably would still be wandering through the mazes of New England textile mills were it not for two important events in my life. Marriage to Harriet Copeland in 1939 made it imperative that J settle into a steady pattern of earning — if not a spectacularly good one. The Army Air Corps claimed me in 1942 (same year daughter Ann Copeland came along) and made that pattern an accomplished fact. I entered service as a second lieutenant and was mustered out in 1945 as a captain. The interim years saw me in several eastern installations — England (on the staff of General Curtis LeMay — Eighth Air Force) and finally Chicago where I worked in contract renegotiations up and down the Mississippi River. The geography was wonderful, the work interesting, the time passed",Jane Sarah,17 October 1946,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,466.0,,,Brandon Gill,1.0,,1931

I HAVE spent close to twenty years teaching English to a segment of American youths, fifteen to seventeen years of age, who happened to be living in Cambridge at that time and hence attended the boys’ high school, named the Rindge Technical School. I need not mention the challenge such a job presents. The reader realizes all too well how important those years are in the training of any individual. In retrospect, few of us can deny that they were the formative years — for good or evil, for success or fail 257 ] ure, for a life of anxiety and worry, or one of contentment and satisfaction. Thus, the opportunity the classroom affords me to meet these young men, to help them to whatever degree I can, provides a satisfaction I can find nowhere else. To be sure, the teacher’s salary could and should be higher, but one learns to get along with what one has. When one has learned how to get peace of mind and gratification from one’s daily toil, one should count one’s blessings. I don’t quite know what caused this serious turn of thought for, surely, many days in the classroom are light-hearted, exhil arating, and pure fun as only the lad of seventeen truly knows. Sometimes I catch a whiff of this elixir of youth and then my work takes on new meanings and possibilities. Cicero tells us that books are the food of youth and the solace of age. To the teacher who is devoted to his work, the day-by-day job of teach ing is his satisfaction and contentment. Best of all is the gratifying thought that the years that lie ahead should bring more of the same,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,195.0,LX3Q-C46,1.0,Collin Eaton,1.0,,1931

If I remember correctl it was the circumstance of having passed a Latin college board examination — I think it was the CPK exam — with a creditable grade that satisfied a language requirement which permitted me to escape German A. Yet twenty-five years later I find myself living and working in Germany, married for over twenty-one years to a Munich girl, and earning my bread and cheese in large part through a fluent knowledge of that language which I so carefully avoided as an undergraduate. _ The story of how this all came about goes back to the summer of 1932 when, ‘after graduating that June as an OCC student, I embarked upon the grand tour of Europe, provided, among other things, with a recommendation to a Munich family by classmate Frederick E. Bissell, Jr. I had not been enthusiastic about making the trip in the first place, and it was by pure coincidence that I found the people in Munich when I tried to look them up, due to a misunderstanding concerning names. In fact, if fortune in the form of the eldest daughter of this family had not happened along at the precise moment when she did, the chances are very good that the young Harvard graduate who had come to Munich for six days would not have stayed for six months, would have gone to the Harvard Law School that fall as he had planned, instead of entering the University of Munich, would not have married the young Muenchnerin he met by chance at the door of her house, would never have progressed beyond the wo ist der Bahnhof stage of German, and might never have returned to this (the European) side of the ocean. There are a number of other more complicated probabilities involving cultural, social and psychological development, but I think that those enumerated will suffice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,580.0,LHKC-7CJ,1.0,Collin Eaton,1.0,,1931

In 1941 I joined the Chicago office of the same firm, moving my home to the Windy City. The following year I was inducted into the Army Air Corps. At the war’s end I decided to seek new fields to conquer, which resulted in my entering city planning work, a profession which I have found interesting and stimulating, if not lucrative. After three years with the Chicago Plan Commission, I took a competitive examination for the position of planning analyst with the Los Angeles Department of City Planning. I was the successful candidate and in the fall of 1947 I packed bag and baggage and headed west. At this rate I should be in Honolulu before long",,,,,,,,,,,,,65.0,,,Riley Eastmond,0.0,,1925

C.; Masons; Lions International, DURING the decade of 1925 to 1935 I lived in Pomfret, Connecticut, where I was engaged in every type of agriculture known to man, but most of it connected with the equine species, a very uncertain animal. At some time during the years of depression I got the idea that I should move to New York and enter the brokerage business. It was hardly an auspicious time for such a daring step, so, in 1935, 1 continued my trek southward until I reached the foot of the Blue Ridge in Loudoun County, Virginia. Here I have remained ever since, living a most pleasant life, but engaging in the difficult operation of making a farm produce all the necessities of life and a few luxuries besides. If any of the Class should be motoring through Virginia, they have a standing invitation to come by and split a bottle of Bourbon. During the war I was attached to General Arnold’s offices and to the office of the assistant chief of Air Staff Intelligence as a liaison officer, an interesting but not a martial job. However, I have kept up my interest in Air Force affairs as a reserve officer. I am now again a resident of Virginia and with some jest. I have derived a good deal out of life, but when my accomplishments have been written on the stone tablets of time they are not very imposing. However, they say that as a man gets older he becomes wiser, so I’m hoping",Charles Van Brunt,"Jr., ",Hope Elliott,2 November 1929,Carolyn Powers,5 October 1934,Robert Allerton,22 January 1940,,,,,155.0,KCQN-RFG,1.0,Riley Eastmond,1.0,,1925

Upon due reflection, I recall that I was in the first class to occupy the new Business School buildings across the river and perchance the authorities were more interested in buildings than in students. The next twenty years were happily spent teaching in all grades from grammar school to college grades. To be greeted cordially and sincerely by former pupils is ample compensation for the time and effort expended on apparently unappreciative minds. Then came the revolution.

AN optimist with a strong streak of fatalism, I generally hold that this is the best of all possible worlds, but in weaker moments I have considered how thin is the line between Pangloss and Job. I have been fortunate in many ways. My bride of these many years is a sensitive lady of great perception (ie. she sees through me), tempered with understanding and tolerance. Our two sons are a source of pride, although I note with some disbelief that they beat me at chess with increasing frequency and are often better informed on baseball, the Civil War and existentialism, to name just a few subjects. I have been fortunate at my work. This may not have been obvious when I left the Harvard Graduate School in 1938, apathetically abandoning a career in biology for a job selling premiums and advertising, nor four years later when I returned to scientific work, with a very considerable reduction in pay. The next year was spent on pharmaceutical chemical research, mainly extracting female sex hormones from thousands of gallons of pregnant mare urine. Chemistry was stimulating, but I was becoming terribly self-conscious about the unremovable stench. With a new sense of direction at last, I sought fresher, less odoriferous fields, where with devotion and application I rose to the post of research director for a small com pany in industrial chemistry — then began moving into sales work again. For the past eleven years, I have been associated with the American branch of an ancient and distinguished Swiss chemical organization. Having attained a very modest degree of material success, I am now an armchair chemist-salesman-administrator, still 1586 working hard but deriving some little sansfacaon from what Tho yw is a useful and certainly challenging life",,,Robert Lawrence,6 June 1948,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,910.0,,,Victoria Lopez,1,,1936

From investment counsel — Scudder, Stevens & Clark, Boston, in 1936 —I progressed through assistant chief, Labor and Security Division, Boston Ordnance District, then six years post-war as sales engineer for a large central New York custom molder of plastics, then back to investments.

AS predicted in the senior album, I did enter the Army after graduation as a Cavalry lieutenant under the Thomason Act, which at that time made it possible for graduates of institutions other than West Point to do so. By the end of the year for which I had signed up, which was enjoyable and I now think profitable, it had become apparent to me that law rather than military service was the objective. Returning to the Harvard Law School, I really got down to hard work, by dint of which I managed to graduate in 1940. No sooner was the hurdle of the Massachusetts bar examination surmounted than my military past insured me of early re-entry into the Army. For the next few years, horses being out of style, and with whom I had hoped some day to practise, probably contributed to my turning from the practice of Jaw for the time being. As a related alternate, I went to work for the Connecticut General Life Insurance Company in Boston, working on the thorough estate analysis and planning methods then being pioneered by that company and also on employee benefit plans. This experience proved extremely useful if not immediately profitable. However, after two years of it I realized that I really did want to practise law and in this same field. I opened a one-man law office which was not too busy for some time and have been working on estates, trusts, wills and related matters, such as pension and profit-sharing trusts, ever since. It seems to me that it is one of the most rewarding and satisfying types of practice because it is constructive planning for the well-being of people. Many lawyers see people at their worst — when they are bickering, or battling, or in the toils; I see them at their best — when they are thinking about their wives and children. In 1960, I joined the firm of Hale, Sanderson, Byrnes & Morton, which is not a partnership but an association of individual practitioners such as I, sharing office facilities and expenses. It seems to be a happy combination of independence and cooperation",,Jacqueline Quincy Ott,Jacqueline Quincy Ott,Jacqueline Quincy Ott,0.0,27 June 1952,,Henry Quincy,20 April 1954,CHILDREN,True,,,,Lucy Glover,12 March 1958,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,223.0,,,Nathan Wise,1,,1936

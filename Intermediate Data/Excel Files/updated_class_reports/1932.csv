But after another year there was no further dickering with the health problem and I went on the road selling furniture. Out of my line again, and I shifted to creating and manufacturing art objects for the gift trade. Then came the war. “Gifts” struck me as scarcely a worthwhile contribution, industry wanted no truck with a man of my draft status, so I enlisted, After a hilarious (in retrospect) six weeks in and out of hospitals with measles and kindred incapacitating inflictions, I got going in basic training as an engineer at Fort Belvoir, then O.C.S. Went to Camp Campbell as a shavetail, was adjutant for the 365th General Service Regiment. Requested transfer to a topo outfit, got it, joined the 649th Engineer Topo Battalion as supply officer at Camp Picket. Landed in North Africa with the Battalion and became, in addition to unit duties, a liaison between Survey Directorate of AFHQ and the Engineer Supply Officer at SOS NATOUSA. Was transferred out of the Battalion to SOS as Engineer Topo Supply Officer. Stayed in this capacity through MTOUSA and SOLOC until the war’s end, then home and out. — Resumed the gift business, added teaching decorative painting during slack seasons, increased this by selling art supplies by mail with instructions for using them. This gravitated into a publishing business in art crafts.. Was losing my shirt in a magazine venture, turned my equipment and experience into preparation of material for offset lithography to pay the bills and keep the magazine afloat. Couldn’t do both, decided to stick with the one that was paying — although “Bench & Brush Publishers” is still a small side issue.",,,William F.,17 April 1935,,Joan E.,7 September 1939,Philip M.,28 February 1942,,,,,,,46.0,,,Brandon Gill,1.0,,1932

ALTHOUGH I have not yet reached the fifty-year mark, my life to date falls into two major periods of roughly a quarter century each. The first of these—from 1910 to 1933 — when my formal education came to a close, seems in retrospect to have been much longer and more leisurely than the second — from 1933 to 1957 — which covers my business career up to the present, and finds me facing a Twenty-fifth Reunion. I could wish that the pace might slacken in the years which lie ahead, so that if I am privileged to look back upon them, in the process of preparing a biography for a Fiftieth Reunion, they may more nearly resemble the years of my youth than those of my middle age. This should not be construed as a desire for a second childhood — but rather as an indication that life has been good enough to make the increasing rapidity of its passing a matter of real regret. Like all of you, I, of course, completed my undergraduate work during a period when gainful employment was virtually an impossibility. At the time a teaching career, with the promise of long summers in the out-of-doors, beckoned appealingly. So, in the hope that jobs might be more plentiful in another year, I returned to Harvard to do some graduate work as further preparation for this profession. But conditions were no better in 1933, and after a few months of selling stocks and bonds in Albany, (535 ]",,Kathleen Lamont,13 September 1940,,,,,,,,,,,,371.0,,,Reid Empey,1.0,,1932

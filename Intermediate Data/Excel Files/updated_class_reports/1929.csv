AS we wrote for the Vicennial Report we have been in Boy Scout Work since 1930. I served as field scout executive at Youngstown, Ohio, from 1930 to 1933. In November, 1933, I transferred to Sterling, Illinois, and then went to Rockford, Illinois, in March, 1935, as assistant scout executive. In September, 1936, I was transferred to Danville, Illinois, as scout executive and then in September, 1941, to Appleton, Wisconsin, also as scout executive. While in Appleton I was drafted and spent over two years in the Air Force. I came within fifteen minutes of going overseas, but it was discovered at the last minute that I was too old for overseas service in that particular shipment, so I spent my entire acres in apples, five acres in peaches, and the rest in corn, oats, wheat, and clover. In the past three years we have learned that once the mortgage is paid a farmer can just a little more than break even without resorting to government doles, subsidy payments, and handouts for good farming practices. My neighbors say I’m crazy for not taking government payments for fertilizing, liming, and mulching the orchard, but I agree with Secretary of Agriculture Benson’s ideas for returning our nation’s economy to a sound basis.

UNABLE to continue my academic career for lack of necessary funds, I decided to seek fame and fortune with one of the larger chain-store outfits in Yonkers, New York, immediately after Commencement in 1929. After two years of hard and intensive work, I found that the chain-store business did not offer all I had anticipated. On returning to Boston in the fall of 1932, I became interested in installment buying, which was growing by leaps and bounds and became affiliated with a large jewelry chain, as assistant credit manager. After working at this position for three years, I came to the conclusion that my proper niche in the business world could only be attained through the insurance business. I took an office account debit with the’ Metropolitan Life in 1935, and was appointed assistant manager within the year. In February of 1937 I was transferred to Waterbury, Connecticut, which today I look upon as a second home. Despite long hours and hard work, many promises made to me never materialized, and I submitted my resignation in May of 1946. I began to specialize in accident and health insurance, covering the state of Connecticut ‘for several insurance companies. I returned to Boston in August of 1947 to become general agent for Continental Casualty and Craftsman Insurance Company. Since 1947 my office has been located at 114 State Street, where under the name of Samuel Cikins Insurance Agency, I have been able to develop this business to the point where we can offer coverage of every description. The years have not been easy; there has never been time for hobbies. Yet I have learned, from many bitter experiences, that with faith in God and the will to look on the brighter side of things, there is much that life has to offer",,Phyllis Sara Tumaroff,1 February 1933,Arthur Joseph,8 May 1940,,,,,,,,,,,145.0,,,Kevin Cox,1.0,,1929

In quest of a life work useful to society and congenial to myself I spent three years at law school in the Middle West. This was followed by admission to the Massachusetts bar and three years of law practice in Boston. I was making slow progress in learning the application of legal principles to reallife situations and the kind of law-in-action not found in books and was approaching the point where my study and experience might begin to be of some substantial value to clients and to society at large. At this point I was inducted into the Army and had a small part in the war effort, mainly in office routine carried on in the field. Entering the service as a private, I finished as a “T'/3,” serving successively in a Signal Battalion, the Signal Section of an Army Headquarters, and the Signal Center of General Eisenhower's Supreme Allied Headquarters in Europe. My service gave me an opportunity to see parts of North Africa, Sicily, England, France and Germany and their peoples which I probably would never have seen otherwise. It also ripened within me the conviction that both the causes of men’s woes and our failure to find satisfactory cures and solutions stem from our prior failure to apprehend and follow the Eternal God’s purposes for us revealed in His Son and to use the resources He offers us to help us reach our fulfillment in glorifying and serving Him — and, incidentally, in coming closer to realizing the Good Society on this Earth. It was this conviction which prompted me to offer myself for the ministry.

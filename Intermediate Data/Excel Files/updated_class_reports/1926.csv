I read certain of the biographies which told of classmates who had unshackled themselves from a desk job and city life. The ferment, along with other factors such as the undesirability of trying to raise children in a city, caused me to sell a very attractive Frank Lloyd Wright house in the suburbs of Madison and move to a run-down farm, where I acquired a herd of cows, a drove of pigs, and 500 chickens. The impact of the countryside on me, and my efforts to reform rural life in America, are more fully set forth in a book which Harper’s published. For reasons not entirely clear to me, I have acquired the status of expert on farming and rural life, and a guide for bucolic adventurers is ready to hit the bookstands",,American Newspaper Guild,"We Chose the Country, Harper’s, 1948; T'ry and Stump Me!

Twenty-five years have acquired a pattern, most of which is absorbing, at least to me, and much of which seems good for one reason or another, also chiefly to me. ~ Since this is a report to a college, it may be appropriate to say that one of my chief preoccupations is public education. Too often its fundamental currents have been muddied by flash floods of expediency (as, for example, trebling a budget in five years, or multiplying public indebtedness by twenty in a building program which in three years has involved about $9,000,000).

After four years as an underwriter with the Massachusetts Bonding and Insurance Company in their Boston and Chicago offices, I returned ~ to Baltimore in 1930 and became associated as office broker with the insurance agency of Maury, Donnelly & Parr, Inc. I have been engaged ever since in the general insurance business. In June, 1942, I entered the Army as a volunteer officer candidate and was commissioned second lieutenant in the Air Corps at its Miami Beach O.C.S. in February, 1943. I took the A.A.F.S.A.T. fighter control course at Orlando that spring and served as a fighter controller with the 11th Air Force on Adak and Amchitka during the Aleutian Islands campaign. After further service with the First Air Force at the Roslyn, Long Island, fighter control center in 1944, I saw the end of the war in Europe with another fighter control squadron engaged in operating a radio direction finding net for the Ninth Bombardment Division of the Ninth Air Force. 2 Maury, Donnelly & Parr, Inc., maintained my insurance business for me during the war so that, when I finally was terminated in January, 1946, I was able to start in again just about where I had left off three and a half years before",,,,,,,,,,,,,135.0,G9X6-CCP,1.0,Carly Sagers,1.0,,1926

But after another year there was no further dickering with the health problem and I went on the road selling furniture. Out of my line again, and I shifted to creating and manufacturing art objects for the gift trade. Then came the war. “Gifts” struck me as scarcely a worthwhile contribution, industry wanted no truck with a man of my draft status, so I enlisted, After a hilarious (in retrospect) six weeks in and out of hospitals with measles and kindred incapacitating inflictions, I got going in basic training as an engineer at Fort Belvoir, then O.C.S. Went to Camp Campbell as a shavetail, was adjutant for the 365th General Service Regiment. Requested transfer to a topo outfit, got it, joined the 649th Engineer Topo Battalion as supply officer at Camp Picket. Landed in North Africa with the Battalion and became, in addition to unit duties, a liaison between Survey Directorate of AFHQ and the Engineer Supply Officer at SOS NATOUSA. Was transferred out of the Battalion to SOS as Engineer Topo Supply Officer. Stayed in this capacity through MTOUSA and SOLOC until the war’s end, then home and out. — Resumed the gift business, added teaching decorative painting during slack seasons, increased this by selling art supplies by mail with instructions for using them. This gravitated into a publishing business in art crafts.. Was losing my shirt in a magazine venture, turned my equipment and experience into preparation of material for offset lithography to pay the bills and keep the magazine afloat. Couldn’t do both, decided to stick with the one that was paying — although “Bench & Brush Publishers” is still a small side issue.",1,0,0

AS an undergraduate, I may be remembered for my preoccupation with the problem of preventing World War II. I report for the record that I failed. In the summer of 1938, I spent several weeks in Austria with the Quakers in their work with the Jews trapped by the Anschluss with Germany. During the next two years, I held down a job with a Boston investment counselling firm. The “sitzkrieg” was getting ready to blitz, and I worked with the neutrality committees. Before the bombs had dropped on Pearl Harbor, War III; but to share the burden of this modest assignment, I now had a lovely and understanding lifelong companion. (What she had acquired in return is a good question.) New York was the new World Capital. For us it meant a summer in Harlem, a year in a cold-water flat in the industrial region below Canal Street, and a more respectably housed year on 84th Street",1,1,0

Blanchard; articles in Yachting, July, 1955, and Boats, December, 1955; “Exploring Down East,” Inland Waterway Guide, Fall, 1962. ON the morning of September 21, 1938, I broke a window in the Fenn School to celebrate the beginning of my teaching career. I taught four classes in the morning. In the afternoon New England experienced one of the most destructive hurricanes in its history and school was closed for a week. So it has gone. Here are a few high points. I taught at the Fenn School in Concord from 1938 to 1945. During this time I learned more about teaching than I taught about English. I married Mary Chandler and we became the parents of twins, Bob and Bill; later, John completed the family. In 1945 I moved to Belmont Hill School to teach English, to coach crew and various other sports as occasion demanded, and to produce plays, magazines, and debates at various times. Our three boys made their several ways up the academic ladder, graduated at last, and are now in college. Bill is a junior at University of Pennsylvania, Bob is a sophomore at Lawrence College, and John is a freshman at Harvard. I didn’t have any war record. The doctors found all kinds of things the matter with me, things which I had ignored for years, and I was labelled as “damaged goods.” The only job I could find that needed badly to be done and that was not being eagerly sought by a dozen others in search of draft deferment and high pay was the one T held at the Fenn School. So I did that job, During the summers I worked in a machine shop, in a shipyard, and on a farm in the hope that I was being some immediate help to those of you who were fighting the war. In 1949 at a P.T.A. meeting I stood up and made a suggestion. won the Friendship Sloop Society regattas in her. In 1960 we visited nearly every harbor between Marblehead and Grand Manan. I rewrote the eastern section of A Cruising Guide to the New England Coast for the fifth edition, a book which my father and my coauthor Fessenden Blanchard had steered through four successful editions",1,0,0

IN reflecting on the past twenty-five years, as most of us have been doing (aided, abetted and “prodded” by Messrs. Davis and Wight), I recall rather vividly my impressions (as a “jaded” senior) of the twenty-five-year class cavorting about the Yard during our Commencement exercises. At that time I thought they looked rather old and slightly decrepit. Strange how one’s perspective changes when cast in the same role twenty-five years later! While I don’t feel too old or too decrepit (I say to myself), I can say with a certain amount of conviction that, like a lot of us, I have certainly packed a lot of living into the past twenty-five years! In retrospect they somehow appear to fall into a series of “chapters.” First, there were those years immediately following graduation when those of us who went to work (involuntarily) rather than continue on in Graduate School came up against the cold realities of life circa 1938. Jobs in Boston (or anywhere) were extremely scarce and difficult to get, paid little or nothing and offered little in return",0,0,0

In the world at large, the fury and cataclysm of World War Il—all but continuous war on smaller scales and differing stages ever since— the splitting of the Atom and all the manifold consequences thereof —the world-wide population explosion — the reconstruction and renaissance of Western Europe—the end of colonialism— the emergence of Communist China, democratic India and all the other new undeveloped states with their “revolution of rising expectations” —the exploration of space—the explosions of new products, techniques, businesses. At graduation, my immediate aim was a summer’s tour of Europe and return to a job in a New York buying office for a year. Then a year in a Boston department store, finally the Business School and my family’s department stores in Salem, Beverly and Danvers; someday to succeed my father as treasurer. How settled it all seemed, even with Hitler’s mad preparations in the back of my young mind. I expected a war, but tried to put it out of mind. ~ 1939 was a wonderful summer in England, Ireland, France, Belgium, Germany, Italy. New York that winter was hard work and fun —- away on my own. 1940 saw me back home, commuting to Boston, a junior executive in a Boston department store. 1941 saw me at the Business School and in love with Hope Osborne whom I married next year. 1942 saw me an ensign, U.S. Navy Reserve. 1943 saw me out of the Business School and into the Navy. Hope and I made a mad series of sixteen “abodes” in nine months, capped by a glorious four in San Francisco, 1944-45 saw me in Fspiritu Santo, the Admiralties, New Guinea, the Philippines, as an officer in a P.T. boat base. 1946 saw Hope and me re united in Washington (cross word puzzle section of BuOrd), Brookline, alem",1,0,0

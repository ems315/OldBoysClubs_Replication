But just to shake Secretary BulldogSmith off the seat of my pants, I will modestly finger-daub a brief self-portrait. When the war ended I was purchaser of tools and in charge of factory layout at Gear Plant No. 1, General Electric Company. I thanked them for my stay and went back to my three saloons. In a saloon nobody discusses political, social, or religious convictions unless they are prepared for enmity, so I pass this topic.

Five years more of industrial ordnance, and nine years out, I was again emerging into a new, if not so cold, world to begin a sales-engineering career in industry. This led to my own business, an electronic manufacturer’s representative firm, Andco Sales-Engineering, Inc. My wife, Jane, has meanwhile helped me in so many ways that it would be unfair to take anything like sole credit for any of my particular claims to fame. One such claim is, I think, having developed into a tolerably good Philadelphian, despite a strictly New England upbringing. Another is my part in raising two children: Andy (Philip, Jr.), now a junior at The Hun School, Princeton, New Jersey, and Susan, a freshman at Springside School in Chestnut Hill, Pennsylvania. We try to do things as a family, to live a conservative and reasonably orderly life, to take part in our fair share of civic or church affairs, and to always get home for Mattie’s cooking by the fastest and earliest transportation, We head for the Jersey shore on holidays, take pride in our home in Germantown, complain about the heat, love to discuss the Friends (Mrs. A. is of Quaker ancestry) and feel that we couldn't live anywhere else in the world. However, we did make Switzerland our headquarters for ten weeks this past summer, where we occupied a chalet and spoke French.

One comfort was that some Yale classmates, more confident that their education had been entirely and permanently completed, were even more surprised: Summer vacations at law school began at President Butler’s pleasure, and he favored early departure and late return to Manhattan. These were summers of gloating, with a little time spent dabbling in a large law firm, but not enough sense acquired to latch on to the nirvana of academic life for good — which at one point was a possibility. I remember powering through the Cape Cod Canal in the summer of 1941, on a Classmate’s cruising sloop, eating lunch in the cockpit, and waving complacently at ROTC and ninety-day officers and crew of a destroyer going by — but soon thereafter, riding in an army truck right past my law office, en route to Fort Devens",Barbara W.

I HAVE spent more time studying the lives of Jacques Ach, Thayer Cummings and Wells Fay than I ever did Plutarch’s. It was the biographies of these esteemed gentlemen, you may recall, that Bentinck-Smith sent us as inspirations for our contributions to this tome. My reaction was complete dismay. Success, fulfillment and orderliness burst forth from every page. Would that my saga could measure up to these paragons, but somehow a few discrepancies crept into the script. In one sense I suppose I am closest to Jacques Ach. He reported one wife and three children. That’s my story. The kids show great promise — and break it regularly. The eldest (female), a senior in high school, is in the midst of the college sweepstakes. (Do you want me? Well, I don’t know whether I want you.) The next, high school sophomore (male), is more concerned with his Wildroot Cream Hair Oil Hair Dressing than he is with his Latin. The youngest (eight and male) is great at roller skating and kickball but is sadly remiss in discharging his daily responsibilities toward his two Luxembourg Hares. The wife still shows promise, which I consider high praise in light of her travails over the past twenty-three years. Mr. Ach and I have something else in common: politics — only in reverse. He started out a Democrat and ended up a Republican. I can only reconcile my forensic support of Alf Landon through the halls of Winthrop House in the fall of 36 by the thought that the Papilio turnus spends a long time in his chrysalis before he emerges to fly about and observe the world with reasonable perspective. My political activities unal recently have been confined to organizing local uprisings in support of Messrs. Stevenson and Kennedy. At the moment I am purposefully involved in an exciting reform movement, known as COD, designed to revitalize the Massachusetts Democratic party organization. We hope the blood will be flowing freely by 1964. Meanwhile, back at the Town Hall, I am serving on the Town Warrant (Finance) Committee. This is alarming to those who know how I handle my own dough. 196 } 2§TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT As to the world of commerce, Thayer Cummings and I one — well, perhaps, as one-half. We're both in the adve agency business—but he’s on Madison Avenue, and I’m in Square, Boston. But the difference doesn’t end there. He felt pelled to deliver an impassioned defense of advertising as a p sion. Frankly, I don’t think it’s any more respectable than be banker, lawyer or merchant chief.

At this late date (1960), I took off on a new vocational bent with a dual assignment of teaching at Western Michigan University and working for the Midwest Program on Airborne Television Instruction. A new duty this year is managing the university FM radio station. ‘Ten years of radio and television work as a performer in my previous job plus some television moonlighting for a commercial station gave me background and experience. Even at that my first semester of teaching on closed circuit television was plain hard work. Covering this end of Michigan for airborne television is true educational pioneering, and American education is bound to feel the impact of this six-state regional experiment.

It took me two years to find out the “culture” didn’t sell apples, and I went to Harvard Business School to see if it would help.

I felt like Dick Whittington heading for London. I boarded, I was lonely, I was perpetually broke — and then came Pearl Harbor. I offered myself to the Navy, but by using Japanese eye tests they torpedoed my offer. I still have it against the Japs for pulling this one on me. The Air Force wasn’t so choosy, however. Being “busted” a couple of times didn’t seem to bother anybody because eventually they made me an officer. All I got out of the war was a hope that we would never have another; not because I hated war but because I hated the idiotic way it was run, The other thing I got out of the war was my wife, Nedra Jane.

In the rocess, I have developed an intense interest in the applications of this air handling industry. This interest in a phase of aerodynamics probably stems from early desires to be a pilot. These desires were cancelled as far as professional flying was concerned by the need for glasses. In college, a few advanced math and physics courses dulled interest in becoming strictly an aeronautical engineer. With this combination of circumstances and with the intercession of Classmate Henry Baum, on graduation I became a budding sales engineer in the commercial and industrial fan market. While this is a very specialized field, the applications of the air we breathe is universal. In this vocation, I started with the B. F. Sturtevant Company located in Boston and one of the largest fan manufacturers. After apprenticeship, two years were spent in the Greensboro, North Carolina, office where the applications were principally in the textile and tobacco industries. From 1941 to 1950, I was manager of the Milwaukee Office. During the war years, most of the air applications involved our war effort —such things as shell cooling, brass chip conveying, and even rocket powder conveying. The Navy did not want me because of my eyes, and the Army did not want me enough to draft me, so I was not called into service. At the close of the war, the Sturtevant Company became a division of Westinghouse Electric Corporation and my work moved more into the commercial air conditioning field. In 1950, Westinghouse transferred me to Chicago as area manager with a later promotion to midwestern regional manager for air handling apparatus sales. Closing out 1957, I left Westinghouse and became western sales manager for Chicago Blower Corporation. Our headquarters and plant are here in Chicago. This firm is an average-size, fast-growing fan company specializing just in the fan equipment field. Some recent interesting applications of our fans involved missile cooling, liquid oxygen fume exhaust, and aeration of the country’s vast quantity of stored grain. I have the responsibility of sales through some thirty-three offices located from Chicago to the west coast. “As part of the management team and concerned with the growth and profit of the company, the challenge is greater and so are the rewards.

Then I went to Ann Arbor for research on selection and a Ph.D. Since 1948, I have been at the University of Chicago. It is a great place! Staff members here have about as much freedom to do what they want as any place you can name: e.g., I ordinarily teach only one course at a time. But the training of graduate students and an assortment of professional activities cut heavily into the time supposedly available for research. I married Barbara while she was still at Radcliffe. She has worked on a variety of community activities. Right now, she is deeply involved in a local Cleaner Air Committee and in the State Board of the League of Women Voters. We lost our first-born to leukemia. We now have a tall fourteen-year-old boy who likes bridge, fishing and ideas, and a sweet nine-year-old girl who likes people. The family’s love of camping led to our acquiring part-ownership of an idyllic little lake in the farmlands of Wisconsin. We escape the city whenever we can — camping by the lake in the heat of summer and using the cottage for weekend vacations in colder seasons, Although my continuing research interest is in efforts to measure the elusive thing called personality, I have written articles on selection, statistics, methodology and why people often don’t do the same thing twice. Middle-age and the need for a change are responsible for my latest baby, just born, a collaborative book called Functions of Varied Experience.

This was closed when I joined the Navy in 1942 and served on escort vessels doing anti-sub patrol and convoy duty in the Atlantic and Caribbean. My naval career ended after participating in the initial assault on Iwo Jima, the support of Okinawa and duty in China waters as commanding officer of the LST 588. I started earning a living again in Binghamton, New York, at Ansco in 1946. Upon leaving Ansco in 1948, we moved to New York City and I became assistant director of the Photo Finishing Institute. Here I developed quality control programs for the photofinishing industry which were later copied and adapted by Ansco and Kodak. At this time I also taught courses in color photography. In May of 1955, I joined one of the largest black and white and color photofinishers in the world, the Berkey Photo Service. Here I set up the control laboratory which currently handles all our B&W and eight different color processes —and more to come. As director of control, R&D, improvements in products and processes are also my sphere, the most recent being “PERMACOTE” which was widely advertised.

When the next mornin; turned out to be unusually pleasant for such early spring, she ar ranged to have a friend open his shop so that we could rent bike to tour the island. As we emerged with Raleighs and Bermud: shorts, we heard an old native say: “Jesus Christ, they’re here already!” Signing those damned Class Agent letters, I thought our 25th would never come — but now that it’s here, I feel like the old boy from Nantucket. In July, 1937, the Boston Globe hired me to clip clippings to file in the “morgue.” After three months with shears, the newspaper business seemed to me less glamorous than soap, so I moved to Lever Brothers as a fifteen-dollar-a-week messenger. My route took me through the melting-out house which smelled like it sounds. The route also included the Rinso packing room where the soap dust was so dense that, when showering after the day’s work, all I had to do was rub to work up a rich lather. This small economy plus a three-dollar raise gave Sadie and me the little encouragement we needed to get married.

IF the evidence were not so ever-present on all sides, you could not convince me that twenty-five years have actually passed since we became the Working Class in June of 1937.

My year as a spad-setter in the coal mines was a complete education in itself and would have been even more interesting if I had not been so anxious to get back to Boston to make certain the girl I had pursued since sophomore year would marry me — which she did not long after I transferred to my present company in Boston. By June of 1941 our life had made me completely forget my adolescent dream of cruising to the tropical islands of the Pacific, when I was called to active duty in the Navy.

MY first faltering steps in the business world back in 1937 seem awfully long ago, and like most of us I found myself on the bottom rung of a very tall ladder. That first job was here in Boston in an insurance agency. It seemed like a good opportunity, although I knew nothing about the business. I also had an active interest in the Navy, having acquired a commission in the Naval Reserve at college. The Reserve outfit I soon joined was called up in October, 1940, so off 1 went for nearly six years’ service in the Navy.

AS any hack writer knows, the first step in writing a piece is finding a theme. (Efe calls it a theme when he’s taking himself seriously; in more commercial moods it’s an “angle” or “hook.”) And, having been hack writing off and on these past twenty-five years (sometimes on themes, more often on angles and hooks), I approached this task with considerable confidence, even élan. That was a couple of weeks ago. Since, despite Bentinck-Smith’s increasingly truculent letters and cards, ’'ve been doggedly searching for the elusive theme until now, several deadlines later, I can procrastinate no longer. It's disturbing. Twenty-five years are a sizable portion of a man’s appointed years and at summing-up time he ought to have something sizable to say. Something like, “. . . and at that moment in the firelight I suddenly found the secret of life.” Or, “... I threw the glass into the garbage pail and haven’t touched a drop since.” Or maybe just the sacred syllable, “OM.” Something big, something with a ring of finality. Well, hang the theme and on with it willy-nilly. I went to work for the National Broadcasting Company right after graduation, groped my way into the then embryonic television department in 1939, mossed around with scripts, props, and scenery for a couple of years and early in 1942 marched bravely off to — I was going to write “the war,” but actually ic turned out to be the Air Corps. After radio operating for close to four years in various parts of the United States and Latin America and attaining the exalted rank of S/Sgt., I found my way back to the soaring towers of Radio City and, as television burgeoned, made the usual progression to director and producer. I was in charge of the network's remote programs such as parades, sports events, political conventions, circuses, presidential inaugurations, and other fringe sectors of Arierican entertainment, At this point, I had one wife and one darchter of five, and we got into the bad habic of discussing LIFE.

That career, quite fortuitously, turned out to be with the University of Denver. This institution (I explain this for my provincial eastern brethren) is the only major private, independent university between the Missouri River and the Pacific Coast.

I began my business career with Carnation Company as a student employee in production immediately after graduation and spent over cleven years in various phases of plant operations. When I decided to make a change in 1948, I had reached the position of nanscer of Pennsylvania plants. As I look back, it was quite an co perience to have lived in eight different states; in some for as little as six weeks and in one for as long as five years. What an crtment of houscs we occupied! The ultimate was a near man-oyanthe heart of lowa through one of their colder winters withoot central heating. Imagine, if you can, a single stove to warm 602 J ten rooms on two floors with the temperature at the thirty-twodegree mark — below zero, that is. We learned what the natives meant by bundling through the winter. Ours included two Irish setters under the covers as foot warmers. In 1948 a long-desired opportunity to buy into a small business was realized, and we journeyed back to Winchester, Massachusetts, to give our all to an automobile agency. As it turned out, the timing was wrong — Chrylsler had a long strike period, and we had no cars to sell—so we gave our all. Shortly after this I joined the Boston Envelope Company and have since learned that sales is my true forte.

MY good fortune in graduating from Harvard College and Columbia University’s College of Physicians and Surgeons appeared to end abruptly when my number was chosen first in the draft. However, my occupation and a temporary physical ailment enabled me to complete a two years’ internship at Bellevue Hospital. By that time, our military might was in the ascendency, so my thirty-month hitch in the Navy was spent in seeing the world, with emphasis on the western Pacific. On getting back to civilian life, I decided to follow in the family tradition of being an eye doctor. After four years of training at the State University of Iowa, and a six months’ traveling fellowship, I joined the staff of the Eye Institute of the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in June, 1951. The past ten years have been busily and pleasantly spent in private practice, teaching a little, and trying to learn something about ocular motility so that “cross-eyed” children might get a better break in facing life. If all this sounds as though I am preoccupied with being an eyeball mechanic, I confess it is true. On the lighter side, I find time to be a weekend golfer, to enjoy an occasional game of bridge, or to spend a Saturday afternoon in the 633 ] fresh air at the “Big A.” On the family side, I find myself chiefly relegated to the roles of disbursing officer or assistant chauffeur",Mildred Victor,1933-1937,,,Ethan Crawford,G37F-XMN,0,

However, much has transpired since then to punctuate the even tenor of my ways. To begin with, the great depression was at our heels, and obtaining a rewarding job was most perplexing at the time.

When winter arrives, we all skate and ski. Here in western Massachusetts, the cold weather lasts four months and winter sports are much in favor.

IT’S a long time and it’s a short time between graduation and the Twenty-fifth Anniversary. It seems that the biggest truth we have to meet face to face is the passage of time. After graduation, I went to B.U. Medical School, interned at the Boston City Hospital, went into the Army, and thence to the South Pacific. Time passed so slowly then. I remember how depressed I was reading Marquand’s So Little Time then — there seemed to be so little time and that time to go so slowly. Yet after discharge, the time went very quickly. I became a surgical resident at the Boston City Hospital, 760 ] 2§TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT and when I was through, chose private practice with a flavor of teaching, rather than a purely academic career. I married a fine, bright girl and have three fine, bright children. The boys are certainly bright enough to get into Harvard, but I wonder if they'll study hard enough. My number one, Jonny, is a radio ham, and is working on me to become one. I don’t seem to find the time for it. Jonny is almost me. Number two, daughter Jackie, is a dear pretty thing and, like most daughters, a trial to her mother and, most of the time, a joy to her father. My number three, Jere, the child of my old age, is very sweet, gentle, and artistic",Maida Rosenberg,1933-1937,,,Emma Evans,G3W6-D6P,1,

I had intended to stay with the Brush Development Company (now known as Clevite Corporation) for about two years and then return to Boston. Instead, I stayed with them for twenty years, married a Cleveland girl, watched my son grow up with a midwest accent and only reluctantly left my adopted city, in 1960. In Cleveland, I continued my education at night school. It took five years at Case Tech to acquire the S.M. degree in physics, and an additional ten years to complete all the course work for the Ph.D. degree in communication engineering. At this point I called a halt: the residency, thesis, and examination requirements were just too much for a family man. My work had gradually changed from musical acoustics to electroacoustic instrumentation to underwater communication engineering. After twenty years at Clevite, I decided that I had gotten into a rut. The job was too comfortable, and I wasn’t actually doing some of the new ideas I had been trying out on paper. So, I spent a year looking around for a new employer (with the invaluable help of Professor Hunt of Cruft Lab), and finally chose Stromberg-Carlson (now General Dynamics/Electronics). I made a good choice. And this in spite of the stock market reports on GD, Fortune Magazine articles, and all the rest. The company has given me a free hand to set up a laboratory, a field site on Seneca Lake, complete with self-propelled barge, and anything else I have needed (including facilities to investigate a new field called Pattern Recognition). After a year and a half, the venture is beginning to pay off. The Navy is happy about ir all, the company is happy, I am happy, and my family (at last) is happy. My son senses my fascination with my work, enough to want to go into some branch of science. This is a source of great satisfaction to me. For I feel that anyone having enthusiasm and the necessary talent who does not go into science in this era, is throwing away his birthright",Vivian Friedman,1933-1937,,,Victoria Perkins,GS5B-3CT,1,

On September 18, 1941, I married one of the few native New Yorkers, born in Green wich Village, and next day I was admitted to New York University School of Medicine. Three months later, Pearl Harbor -—and I was soon in the Army, but was assigned to medical school until 812 } graduation in 1944. I was then commissioned and placed on inactive duty in order to intern for nine months. We thought we'd take this opportunity to travel before recall to active duty, and I chose the huge Los Angeles County Hospital for my internship. However, we remained in Los Angeles for eighteen months, since I was retained as a resident in dermatology. During this time, our first child, Peter, was born, October, 1945. Finally in April, 1946, I was placed on active duty, and travel really began since I was assigned to the 98th General Hospital in Munich, Germany. My wife and son came over six months later, and for almost two years we lived in this Bavarian city as part of the Army of Occupation. I was chief of dermatology and V.D. (of which there was much) and later general staff officer, II Constabulary Brigade Headquarters, We returned to New York in 1948, and after two more years of postgraduate work in dermatology, I passed the “Boards” and became a practicing specialist in this field. I am particularly interested in the industrial aspects of dermatology and in research, and I am an associate clinical professor at the Institute of Industrial Medicine, New York University Medical Center, where I am engaged in cancer research. Furthermore, for the past several years, I have also been active as a consultant for medical publications and advertising and have been consulting medical editor for such publications as Spectrum, Medical News, and Factor. In January, 1951, our daughter Maxine was born. We all enjoy such sports as riding, skiing, tennis and skating. Both my children attend progressive private schools in Greenwich Village, where we live — my daughter, the Little Red School House, and my son the Elizabeth Irwin High School. We are convinced that the paramount issue of today is peace, and strive to achieve it; and as a physician, I feel that good medical care will have to be extended to all the people. This will occur no doubt through some form of national health insurance and probably an expansion of group practice. We have been able to do quite a bit of traveling, including Europe, Canada, Mexico and Cuba. Recently, we were in Greece and Israel, and had the opportunity to visit our classmate, Manny Labes. He lives on a cooperative-collective farm near Tel Aviv, is married to a Belgian girl, has five children, and still looks almost the same as he did twenty-five years ago",Gertrude Weissman,1033-1937,,,Rebecca Bettinger,G3WS-VF2,0,

A FEW days ago I dug out of my old things the thesis which I wrote during my senior year at Harvard. I thought that it might help me to reminisce and maybe kick me off into this narrative of my life. It is working pretty well because starting with the date on the flyleaf of April 14, 1937, and thumbing through its pages which describe the electric power industry in New England, all comes back to me, including the monumental struggle I had producing the thing. More than that, I can see that this paper and the work that went with it had much to do with my seeking work with a utility company after graduation and, consequently, my life work — for, what do you know, I am still at it! That first job was with very large Commonwealth Edison in Chicago; it was a training course and then regular work later. This pulled me away from the Newton suburbs, where I grew up, and fine times on the Cape, but after two years I took a more drastic step yet and moved to Texas. This really broke the pattern, for I turned Texan with few reservations. I liked it then and still do. At first my home was San Angelo in West Texas, and I tried all manner of new things for me. Learned about cattle and sheep and the ranch business, tried to speak Spanish, owned some horses, played polo, hunted and fished, even took a great trip into Mexico with two of my Harvard Classmates. Somehow working for the West Texas Utilities Company seemed secondary to the liberal education I was getting in the ways of the Southwest, 851] This phase ended abruptly with the war and my entry into the Air Corps in 1941. A splendid year of schooling at UCLA in Los Angeles turned me into a meteorologist of sorts, launched me toward duty in California, then a long pleasant residence in Washington, D.C., and finally assignment to China.

MY most pleasant moments at this stage of life are weekend tennis matches, interspersed with squash and occasional flurries of sailing, flying, travel and brief moments with my children when they aren’t off on their own projects. Addicted to tennis as I am, I have been lucky to play indoors at the Hamilton Farm Court in Gladstone and now at the Holmdel Indoor Court. Somewhere I missed golf, which I always felt was too frustrating for my liking. The past twenty-five years have revolved around Montclair, Short Hills, Far Hills and now Phalanx (near Red Bank) where we are living in an old farmhouse once and still referred to as Alexander Woollcott’s house. In between hobbies, I have been engaged in some form of public relations since I first went to work for Transradio Press at 342 Madison. I wrote radio copy for Allan Hale who had a program called “Confidentially Yours.” Outside of this brief period, I have never been a commuter. This fact may have added a few years to my longevity. Before the war, I was with Curtiss- Wright, then served a few years in the Army Air Force as a flight instructor at several fields in this country. Curtiss relieved me of my responsibilities after the war and I then went to Thomas A. Fdison, Inc., as advertising manager, then to Lockheed Electronics Company, as director of public relations. I am now assistant to the president for public relations at Harvard Industries, Inc. Probably the first man to return to Harvard after twenty-five years! 857 ] My lust for travel has never diminished although I shall no doubt have to put off the grand tour until after the children are all married.

A music education at Harvard, plus much fruitful extracurricular musical activity during those four years, had persuaded me that I was ripe for the big city — and vice versa. A year-long apprenticeship in various fields— stock boy in a music publishing house, arranger and pianist for various dance bands, sheet music arranger for a Titan of Tin Pan Alley—convinced me that my music education had just begun. So back to Harvard for an A.M. My only recollections of that year are a diet of beef pot pie and coleslaw at the old Georgian on Dunster Street, and doing the music for a Pi Eta show. A half-year teaching job at the Holderness School in New Hampshire seemed to indicate that secondary education was not for me, so back to Cambridge for another half year of what amounted to private tutorial with a grand old man, Edward Burlingame Hill, of the Music Department. A great teacher, I thought; perhaps there was something to this teaching business, after all.

By 1952, however, I found myself again enmeshed in government. My four years in the State House in Boston were a colorful, educational time. No one could ask for a finer man to work for than Mr. Herter, or a job more ‘interesting than that of chief secretary to a governor. Thus I was happy to go on to Washington with him when he became Undersecretary and later Secretary. of State. Here the hours were also long but stimulating. My wife and I both enjoyed Washington tremendously as a place to live.

TO describe the events of the past quarter-century in terms of an 1112 ] orderly career pattern, determined in advance and planned fur while in college, would be a neat and satisfying way of doing things but such a pattern does not exist in my case. Having been intensely interested in aviation since my early teens, and working in that industry and learning to fly during college vacations, 1 became aw ciated upon graduation with the Piper Aircraft Corporation of Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, and spent about four and a half years most interestingly pursuing what I expected would be a career with that concern. After a year learning the business in the factory and home office, I progressed to the position of traveling district sales manayer covering, in all, practically all of the country, working with the local dealers, seeing the country and building up my first thousand hours of flying time. In the summer of 1941, with the clouds of war darkening the skv and the nation strengthening its military forces, I was one of a small group of civilian pilots who participated in the extensive army maneuvers, demonstrating and proving the potential value to the Army of light airplanes, particularly for artillery air observanon and liaison duties. With the acceptance of the light airplane by the Army, I went to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, as a civilian instructor to assist in the organization and development of the Army's light aviation program, and shortly afterward put on the uniform of an artillery lieutenant. After two years at Sill, was assigned as aviation officer of an artillery group, serving in Texas, Hawau and the Philippines, and, after occupation duty in Japan, was released from service in 1946 to return to my civilian employment",,HENRY SANDERSON WANN,"Officer, U.S. Army; assigned as chief, Aviation Branch, Directorate",,,Georgianna Jane McNerney,1933-1937,G9N6-R6C,1,Ben Morelock,G9N6-R6C,0,

IF Fate had played its hand differently and there hadn't been Worl! War II, I often wonder what I would be doing now, My guce in that I would still be in the banking business, probably wich the Morgan-Guaranty Bank and living in a suburb of New York Crew. I say this because I considered my first job after graduation with J. P. Morgan & Company to be everything that coull be dearet Why switch jobs when one is happy in his work and Icave bebint many close friends? Therefore, I think it reasonable ta assure the day-to-day operations of the College, with extracurricular activities including athletics and with discipline if it is serious enough to involve outside authorities. I haven’t yet found anyone who ever envied me, yet I thoroughly enjoy my work, headaches and all, and there are few days that I don’t look forward to returning to my messy desk in 4 University Hall. As for the home front, my worthy and capable partner and I are the parents of five active, healthy children ranging from eighteen down to nine. We know of no greater responsibility. The budding of these young hopefuls has been for us a fruitful source of interest. What more could anyone ask for? I am also connected with two business enterprises: One, F. L. & J. C. Codman Company in Rockland, Massachusetts, manufacturers of buffing and polishing wheels, of which I am vice-president and director; the other a Massachusetts trust called Polly Watson, which was sct up by my wife in order to design and sell women’s apparel, with an emphasis on originally decorated sweaters, dresses, and suits, For the past ten years we have summered on Cape Cod. My vacation usually consists of following the kids’ activities and devoting considerable time to cultivating a large vegetable garden, working on the house, and an occasional round of golf. These I find necessary diversions from deaning, as Then, being the cautious type, I never found the right girl until 1949 with the result that the fifties were taken up witnessing the arrival of my four red-headed boys. And now into the soaring sixties, I am faced with many of the same teen-age problems that most mem bers of the Class of ’47 are facing and with whom I have frequent contract. The only catch is that my graying hair and lack of agility belie my youth, In actuality the years immediately following graduation were both interesting and instructive. After taking a one-year whack at Harvard Medical School, I spent two years trying to become the world’s greatest salesman. The draft board soon put an end to that in early 1941 and, of course, the one-year draft stretched out to a five-year hitch. Three of these were spent in Australia and New Guinea, where I acquired a real fondness for Australians (including a group of “diggers” in Brisbane with whom I played rugby as a member of the Queensland All-Star Team). Eventually, in January, 1946, I was separated from the service as a captain with a fund of knowledge in signal communication which I have long since forgot",,ROBERT BLAKE WATSON,"Dean of students, Harvard College","Class Agent, since 1938; member, Harvard Fund Council 104+ 51, 1960-62; past president, 1953-55, director, Douglas A.

IT is rather hard for me to write this account “since graduation” since I didn’t graduate or haven’t yet. This is in no way a reflection on the preparatory school I went to and of which I am now a trustee. There I had an excellent preparation but when I arrived at Harvard I took to reading Russian authors in which I was not taking a course and I made the fatal mistake of allowing myself to be put in a History 1 seminar group. I must say that November Hours were a shock but it was too late, the harm was done or rather the good wasn’t, and in spite of all efforts the dean wrote home that I left an excellent moral record behind me at Harvard! Even that depends on how you define the word “moral.” It is hardly surprising therefore that I have not been the Johnny-on-the-spot kind of member of the Alumni Association that 1 might have been under different circum stances. I have always been touched in more ways than one over the welcome I received into the Association when the rest of you 1152] graduated and the appeals which I have received ever since. Not that I resent these latter. It wasn’t Harvard's fault that I Icfe and t am definitely in favor of education and my family is all Plarvard, until my time, that is. A country parson is just not overloaded with dough and besides I have had other commitments which were at least as pressing and I married the daughter of a Yale man! Perhaps it is just as well that I didn’t stay at Harvard, for Pleaven knows what I might have become if I had. Getting kicked out was the first time a door was really shut in my face and it was a jolt but a good one. Having to go to work at the bottom was a salutary experience too, and when I was on my own in Washington and could think for myself, I became more and more sure that the Christian Gospel holds the answers people of all sorts are looking for and that the church in those days wasn’t doing too good a job with it and that God was calling me to pitch in and help for what my help was worth. I didn’t think it was much and I was amazed that by hook but not by crook I managed to prepare for, get admitted to and graduate from Seminary. My amazement and gratitude have grown ever since I was ordained and I wouldn’t trade my job with anyone’s. It is the most rewarding there is, I am sure; and far from waning as some seem to think inevitable, my faith in God has grown steadily through the experiences of my ministry",Eleanor English,1933-1934,LCZS-L5L,1,Connor Hoopes,LCZS-L5L,1,

IT cannot be said that my life during these past, fast twenty-tive ears has been momentous; and in view of the fact that I was nee one of the bright Harvard men invited to join the inner circle and enjoy in moderation (to paraphrase a well-known ad) the disallanion of golden wisdom currently flowing in Washington, it must be recorded that my life has been something less than brilliantly successful. My father was disappointed that I did not, as an under graduate, major in a subject that would fit me for the lw. He envisaged me as a corporation lawyer because, as he put iw b had a greater capacity for learning and retaining useless facts than any one else of his acquaintance. (Corporation lawyers, please note.) He particularly disapproved of my concentrating in French, because teaching a foreign language (he correctly assumed that I would teach) was a kind of “missionary duty”! Well, from a modest start in French, I have gone on to delve int six other languages, none of them exotic, some of which of the long deliberations many elective courses, both in the sciences and in the humanities, have been introduced. Cadets now have the opportunity to broaden and deepen their knowledge along lines of particular interest to them. This is the latest development in the liberalizing process begun during the superintendency of General Maxwell D. Taylor. The work of institutions like Harvard and M.LT. has had considerable influence upon the thinking here, and I am glad that as a product of Harvard on the faculty I have had a small part in helping to reshape the curriculum. Subsequently, I relinquished heading the Russian program in order to organize and teach two of the new electives, one in French literature and one in modern Spanish thought, thus reverting to the field in which I gained the doctorate at Harvard. My only real hobby is reading, and of late years I have become interested in medieval military history insofar as it deals with the development of strategy and tactics. I am translating a study on the art of warfare in the middle ages by a Flemish scholar, J. F. Verbruggen. This study, a major contribution to our knowledge of medieval strategy and tactics, has been overlooked chiefly because it is in Flemish. Two medieval chroniclers, Fernao Lopes, of Portugal, and Pero Lopez de Ayala, the Spanish Froissart, deserve to be more widely known in the English-speaking world. When I retire four years hence, I hope to spend my first sabbatical in twenty-eight years of teaching pursuing the last-named figures. While we get to Europe frequently, there is not enough time in part of a summer to do real research. So it is that my interest in foreign languages has led me far afield from “missionary duty” in merely teaching them to undergraduates",Charity Ellen Cannon (Radcliffe,1933-1937,,,Kevin Cox,G3WF-93G,1,

I FIND it very difficult to account for all of the twenty-five years which, though it seems unlikely, have elapsed since graduation. The first eight years are easy. They were measured mostly by the years required to obtain my law degree and to complete my military service. After graduation from Columbia Law School in 1940 (1 would have preferred Harvard but my parents disagreed), I landed a one-year job as law assistant to Honorable Bernard L. Shientag, one of the best of the New York Supreme Court judges. I agreed to stay on with the judge for an additional year, but before it was half over World War II started, It was not long before I found myself leading a small group of draftees to report for induction at Governors Island, New York, at six o’clock on a bleak Monday morning. By 8:00 A.M. on that day I had been given free coffee and doughnuts by the Red Cross and returned to Manhattan with five cents for the ferry boat ride and the official papers stamped “Unfit for military service” (on account of eyesight). Soon afterwards I journeyed to Washington, D.C., and for the next six months worked as an attorney in the General Counsel’s office of the Treasury Department, Foreign Funds Control Division. 1172 ] In June, 1942, the U.S. Coast Guard was short of personnel and looked the other way when I came up for my eye test. For the next three and a half years I was captain of the Port of Panama City, Florida, and port security officer at various other Gulf Coast cities I learned to operate a fleet of small picket boats in the Gulf of Mexico, to handle the military red tape involved in running a unit of 500 men, and to supervise the feeding, stabling, and grooming of about a hundred horses which the men rode up and down the Florida beaches, presumably to prevent landings by German U-boats",,ROBERT WOLF,"Attorney; member of firm, Hays, Sklar & Herzberg","Trustee, since 1947, president, 1958-61, Educational Alliance; member, board of directors, Mobilization for Youth, since 1960; member, board of trustees, Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, since 1958; treasurer and secretary, New-Land Foundation, Inc., since 1951; member, board of governors, Sunningdale Country Club, Inc., since 1961",,Peggy Frank Gluck,1933-1937,,,Kevin Cox,G3WF-7LF,0,Not enough info

A PERCEPTIVE writer has observed, “A man at fifty begins to recognize how much he depends on the quality and range of what he learned before he was twenty. If he enjoyed a thorough education, his sense of gratitude grows with the passing years.” It is not _ surprising, therefore, that as the forties slip by, I find my gratitude to Harvard taking on new dimensions. To be able twenty-five years after the last class with Whitehead, Lowes or Merriman to relish such a book as The Greek Way by Edith Hamilton, to get full pleasure from a rereading of Shakespeare’s sonnets, or to be able to contemplate with some objectivity and perspective the forces that threaten to limit the span of our American culture, with its electric can openers and solid gold putters, are but a few examples of why I feel increasingly grateful for the quality and range of education we experienced at Harvard. In contrast, I recall my discontent and disappointment when I found that in medical school there was little of the sharing between student and teacher of the spirit of intellectual inquiry and enthusiasm so characteristic of Harvard. Major emphasis was on the memorizing of existing knowledge and the learning of routine technical procedures. The faculty, though distinguished for their research and scholarship, made only infrequent efforts to stimulate the students’ interest in the processes by which knowledge 1s discovered, expanded, tested and refined",Erna Louise Goettsch,1913-1935,LZ1D-1TT,1.00,Carly Sagers,LZ1D-1TT,1,

Not to be overly-introspective, I made my major misstep when I listened to my father’s urging to enter his installment furniture business.

I ADDED the Harvard Law School in 1938 and upon graduation necessary experience was obtained as a clerk in the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office. In 1940, a very high number in the draft was presented to me; we were not at war; the impending problems were none too clear; the Army pay was modest; commissions were hard to get; I sought out the F.B.I. who were looking for eager sleuths. In 1942, we were at war; commissions were still hard to get; I had done a stint of sleuthing in Washington, New Orleans and New York; I enlisted as an apprentice seaman and finally emerged in the spring of 1946 as a bored lieutenant, top floor, with a few traveling ribbons and a bum back. When daily annoyances appear, I try to mutter to myself, “Well, it’s better than the service.” Returning to pick up a practice of law was somewhat slow at first. Time went on with offices in Boston and Marlbore and some dabbling in Republican state politics. In 1953 the Republicans were in office both state and nation-wide, The Republicans hadn't passed 83 ] out anything for twenty years and along came a presidential appointment as U.S. Marshal for the District of Massachusetts. I was somewhat excited, naive, and accepted the post. The foregoing language is esoteric.

As a matter of fact the last twenty-five years as a graduate surely seem to have passed with greater alacrity than the undergraduate four. I imagine that the first ten years after graduation were typical with most of us, as represented by job hunting, marriage and service in one of the military organizations. My case history shows that in August of 1942 I took unto myself a wife, with whom I enjoyed four months of bliss prior to entering the U.S. Coast Guard. In March of 1943 I was assigned to the Coast Guard Academy in New London for reserve officers’ training. In June of 1943, I was graduated from the Academy and assigned, as commanding officer, to the Coast Guard Cutter 83477.

I SHALL never forget my first desire to be an alumnus of Harvard College! When I graduated from Boston High School of Commerce in 1923, I felt then that I] should pursue a business education and major in accounting. With this objective in mind, school nights. This firm was 99% Harvard and, of necessity therefore, it was imbued with all the fine and great traditions that Harvard enjoys. Under such conditions, therefore, it wasn’t long before I began to feel the importance of having a degree from that institution if I ever wanted to make the grade to the top, and particularly if I was to work in Boston! Thus motivated, my first fiveyear plan, so to speak, was first to complete my business education and then tackle my cultural education at Harvard. Thus, where important accomplishments came after graduation for most of my classmates, certain of my goals preceded my graduation from Harvard in 1935. In 1929, I was one of nine who were fortunate to pass successfully (all subjects of) the Massachusetts C.P.A. examination and in 1931 I received my Master of Business Administration degree from Boston University. In 1938 I became interested in Masonry. The experiences and associations while I was an officer of Wellesley Masonic Lodge from 1942 to 1950 are unforgettable and the effects will be long enduring! I cannot help but feel that it helped my desire to round out my academic background. It gave me something additional that only Masonry can give. The culmination of it all was my becoming a Past Master and the instillation within me of a rich religious sense of values and a deep appreciation and feeling for the other man",Alice Daniels,ALEXANDER JOSEPH CHASE,"Certified public accountant; manager, Arthur Young & Company","Auditor, 1938-41, treasurer, 1942-44, Wellesley Congregational Church; past master, Wellesley Lodge, AF. & A.M, 1950; trustee, Wellesley Masonic Lodge, since 1958, member, Educational Committee, Massachusetts Society of Certified Public Accountants, since 1958",,Edith M.

I BELIEVE that every individual has certain capacities which life fulfills. Capacities of enjoyment, sorrow, understanding, tolerance, love, adventure, whimsy — an endless list. I believe these capacities are filled brimming in everyone's life, regardless of the events or circumstances. We see an actor in an endless variety of roles and situations. Sometimes he is the “good” man, sometimes the villain; at times a strong character, at other times weak, But as we sce these different characters and roles portrayed in different settings — saying and doing different things — we come to know the actor himself, as aman, “All the world’s a stage... ,” and we for a brief time have principal parts. I don’t believe it matters much WHAT we do. Ir does matter very much HOW we do ir, Some of us are endowed with rare 370] talents, and these capacities, when developed and exercised, leave an imprint and affect enough people to be worthy of recorded history. But all of us, most of the time, are playing our parts to an empty house. Only the actors themselves know what transpired and felt the impact of the drama. I have been fortunate in my life, and I’ve loved every minute of it.

AS I think back over the past twenty-five years, I realize that my four-year experience at Harvard College should be viewed as an unexpected pleasure. My father, who was hurt by the depression like everyone else, owned a small grocery store, and I probably would have studied at Kansas City Junior College and the Kansas City School of Law in the usual process of events. However, Har 422 ] vard College seemed a very magical place to me, and I wanted to go there. I believed that once J took the Harvard treatment I would emerge as a great writer, or a magnetic business executive. Several uncles and cousins had studied at Harvard, and their careers seemed quite glamorous and emotionally exciting. I applied for a scholarship at the Kansas City Harvard Club, because as the proud possessor of the highest grades at Westport High School, I felt I was deserving and was good scholarship material, I was turned down because I was no good in sports. I told my English teacher at Westport High School about my disappointment and he told me that he was a Harvard graduate and would help me to apply directly to Harvard. I think he advised Harvard that I had within me the potential of a future Chekhov. The result was that I won a small scholarship; I told a wealthy and somewhat sentimental uncle about this, and saw he was impressed. In a weak moment he agreed to pay the difference between what the scholarship paid and what it cost to go to Harvard and stated that as long as I had a scholarship I could go to Harvard.

In addition to graduate work —and acquisition of the necessary Ph.D.—I ran the Winthrop House library, assisted in “History One,” tutored in history and literature, served as assistant dean, was senior tutor of Eliot House, taught in the history department, helped administer and teach in an AST Program, and set up an office to receive returning veterans. Unable to join the armed forces, I decided to do my war service behind a familiar Harvard desk, rather than a strange government one in Washington; but with the approach of victory in Europe I resigned to seek. my own adventure in the new phase of the peace.

In the fall of 1935 I accepted a position (at $12.50 per week, you could hardly call it a job) in the manufacturing division of the company with which I am still associated. In 1937 I got married, and in 1953 | became president of the company. I mention the marriage appropriately at this point because the girl was the boss’s daughter. I'll never be able to untangle the complex that comes of marrying into a business. Would I have made it anyhow, even without the “convenient” marriage? Or would I have made it sooner without the “drawback”? Ill never know, but this I do know — when I came out here from Boston, I brought my broad “a,” my diploma, my dirty saddle shoes and a nagging New England conscience that has constantly driven me to justify and re-justify every raise and every promotion.

TO be obliged to review and evaluate the past quarter-century of one’s life is undoubtedly a salutary experience; but to be obliged to condense and write it in a few hundred words verges on the depressing: one wonders concerning the desirability of such an outline, especially since it can be of direct personal interest to but a small percentage of the potential readers. My life since 1935 has moved more or less directly, though not necessarily smoothly, along strictly educational channels. Five years after graduation, having acquired an A.M. and Ph.D., I left Harvard with an abiding interest in teaching and research, and an intense and continuing curiosity in the problem of what constitutes good teaching. The problem has not yet been resolved, remaining a topic of brisk discussion with my family, and with my colleagues (who sometimes grow politely weary of what they consider an iconoclastic approach to the subject), As I read the examination papers of second-year medical students and struggle to interpret what they have written, I receive continuous reinforcement of my feclings on the “social adjustment” philosophy of education, It seems to me that raising and educating children is a different task today: the time spent in rectifying the errors of omission and commission in their schooling is becoming inordinately long. It would appear that the primary and secondary schools consider their role to be that of inculcating proper approaches and attitudes toward society — an activity which used to be the prerogative of the home 880 ] — leaving the question of teaching subject matter to the parents, by default. I cannot believe that the result of this approach will be a happy one. In the intervening years, I taught and carried on research at the medical schools of Yale, Rochester, Vanderbilt and — final stop? the University of California at Los Angeles. During my cathy years of teaching I began to take courses toward an M. 1). since P had come to the conclusion that a medical training was essential for effective teaching and research in my field. The academic vear 1947-48 was notable in that it required a two-month vacanon. 3 result of the after-effects of holding a full-time teaching and research position while concomitantly carrving out the full-ome schedule of a fourth-year medical student",Edith Frances Kearney,1931-1935,,,Jared Wright,GSLH-8D7,0,

He kindly added “in German,” but I got the point. In spite of this, I got to like the good doctor and his daughter as well, and confess he was almost right in all scores.

This was, of course, interrupted by the war and the Army shunted me off to the 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment, misplacing all my papers so that for some months I was rather an orphan and could not even be paid, As my rank was that of buck private, this did not make a great deal of difference except that the top sergeant became relatively sympathetic. When a mountaineering school was established, first in a gravel pit and later at Mount Rainier, I was promoted to pfc. and given the grand title of chief instructor in ice climbing to the U.S. Mountain Infantry. My seniors, Walter Prager and Peter Gabriel, were both sergeants at that time. The summer of 1942 was delightful on the mountain, and ] managed to ascend Mount Rainier, Mount Hood, and Shuksan on G.I. weekends. In the autumn I applied for O.C.S. and was sent off to a miserable winter at Edgewood Arsenal, where I was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Chemical Warfare Service, eventually reaching the rank of captain before receiving my discharge",,1931-1935,,,Sara Grundvig,L2GB-3PF,1,

I was fortunate in being fished out of the water by a cruiser after a swim of approximately three hours (with my trusty lifejacket!). Eventually I was returned to the States and the the U.S, Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Later the Navy sent me to Johns Hopkins for special training in radiology and then on to the US. Naval Hospital in Chelsea, where I had an opportunity to renew fricndships with a few classmates from the College and many from the Medical School who were located in the Boston area",Alicia Harold Tracy,,,,,,,Is John Faunce Roach (row above)

From this period I have an abiding love for France, Holland and England. In the summer of 1938 I was forced by 6nancial considerations and parental illness to cut short my work at Leiden and start my studies afresh in America. I returned to Elarvard as a graduate student and to Eliot House as a tutor. In thes period I met Mary Bell Marshall, a brilliant pianist, whom [ larer married. I owe this to Harvard, as we were introduced by my music-loving tutor.

In the summer of 1942 I finished my thesis, married, and started war research at Harvard on radar countermeasures. The war work involved seven months in the southwest Pacific as a radar countermeasures planner. At the war's end I became a research associate in the physics department at M.IT., working with Bruno Rossi on cosmic rays.

In 1934 I decided to enter big-time racing and bought the ninety-foot Class M racing sloop Istalena, which I raced very successfully in Long Island Sound and New York Yacht Club cruises. The next year there was talk of international races in the twelve-meter class, so I built the Mitwza which I raced very unsuccessfully for two years. In 1935, I married. This ended my big ideas about yachting and I moved to Philadelphia, bought a sixtyacre farm where we lived until last spring, and for the next few years settled down to being a family man. In 1940, war being imminent (the draft board was snapping at my heels), I secured a commission in the Navy and went on active duty in June, 1941. After indoctrination at Fort Schuyler, New York, and two-month duty at the Torpedo Station, Newport, Rhode Island, I went to sea in the ex-Fleishman yacht Corzayo; anti-submarine patrol out of Pearl Harbor. The Navy was very much surprised to find that two 3-inch guns made the ex-yacht rather topheavy, but they had the answer for that; ten tons of tombstones in the bilges. In November, 1942, I was ordered to Boston to the destroyer Ordranaux, where we saw duty at the landings in Sicily, Naples, Anzio and South France, with a few winter convoy crossings in the North Atlantic, just to wash things down. In November, 1944, 1 was ordered to executive office on the 1g00-ton destroyer Shubrich, then at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. One more trip to the Mediterranean and then to the Pacific, Pearl Harbor and on to Okinawa, where we spent three harrowing months on radar-picket duty, finally succumbing to the kamikaze on June 7th. War ended, with me in command of the battered-up old Shubrich at the Bremerton Navy Yard in Seattle, Washington",Barbara Warden,WILLIAM JUSTICE STRAWBRIDGE,Retired,,,M.

PUBLICATIONS: Few scientific articles in medical journals. IN looking back over the twenty-five years which have elapsed since graduation, I am struck by the fact that what seemed so important at various times appears much less so in retrospect. After graduating, my medical education became the all-consuming master of my time. I worked the school year at the University of Chicago and my summers in Buffalo at the General and Children’s Hospitals. While a freshman at Chicago, I met the girl whom it took me the rest of my school career to convince to marry me, and we were married two days after graduation, My internships and residencies were interrupted by the threat of war. In June, 1941, I became a battalion surgeon assigned to the Kentucky National Guard Regiment and later spent three years in 1407 ] the South Pacific with the New York Postgraduate Hospital Unit doing general medicine and X-ray on the South Pacific islands, mostly vegetating and missing my family —my daughter having been born forty-eight hours before I was ordered off for overseas duty. In 1946, I returned to pediatrics at the Children’s Hospital in Buffalo and then in Cincinnati at the Children’s Hospital and Research Foundation, where I resumed contacts with many of my former Harvard friends, Returning to Buffalo in 1948, I practised private pediatrics for some seven years. I enjoyed teaching and spent much of my time at the university and the Children’s Hospital, where I was on a teaching service and also ran the Endocrine Clinic. In addition, I served as a volunteer pediatrician for the Salvation Army hospital for unwed mothers, for a rheumatic convalescent home and for the Jewish Fresh Air Camp. I became involved with Temple Beth Zion on various boards and with the executive committee of the local chapter of the American Jewish Committee. Looking back, I know I was hopelessly entangled and so busy that something always came up which interfered with my attending local Harvard Club meetings. At the end of 1955, our summer vacation. Fishing vied with attending the closing activities of the children’s camps in Maine. Our daughter NancyGene is attending Mills College in Oakland, California, and son Robert, Jr., is attending the Gow School in South Wales, New York. This spring we took time out as a family for a three-week jet trip to France and Italy and are looking forward to the time of our Twenty-fifth Reunion as our next family junket.

MY intention when I left college was to complete medical school and go into physiological research; but the research got the better of me about half way through, and I joined the research staff of the Fatigue Laboratory. At first the work dealt with cardio-vascular studies, but the problems seemed to migrate from the heart to the mind. Next thing I knew I was designing psycho-motor tests for selecting aircraft pilots; and in 1940 I joined a Navy group working on the selection and training of pilots, being assigned briefly to the Naval Air Station at Pensacola. Our entry into the war put me on duty as a research officer (lieutenant, j.¢., A-V(S)) at the Los Alamitos primary training base in California. But during the next few years, I visited many of the training bases about the country — encountering the usual array of experiences, both exasperating and entertaining, Fortunately, the latter heavily predominated.

Lack of civil service status led eventually to my leaving the Justice Department to become an economic analyst with Dun & Bradstreet in New York.

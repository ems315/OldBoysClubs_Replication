Perhaps this is a confession that I continue to be the most inefficient member of our class, and I cannot deny it. Six children, from twenty-four to four, keep the Armstrongs from becoming bored and conspire to fill up—or should I say take away — our leisure hours. For now they suffice as hobbies. This is not a complaint, for we would not have it any other way. And my arithmetic is razor sharp. I have the same patient employer who offered me my first and only job back in 1932. At that time I started a two-year apprenticeship in our factory, and since then I have been busily engaged trying to learn other facets of the cutting-tool business. In 1952 I became president of the company and since that time I have come to realize how much more there is to learn about it. It has been a challenging experience to be associated with a company which has had no labor difficulties during its eighty-one years, and I am proud of this association.

MY life in the outside world, away from home, school, and Harvard, really began in my junior year. During my sophomore year I worked a deal with the Harvard authorities under which I could spend my junior year at Trinity College, Cambridge, England, and get credit at Harvard for the work done there. I had a delightful year there and during my stay engaged in what was to become one of my principal hobbies, namely, travel. One of the pleasant things about this English University was the length of the Christmas and Easter holidays. This permitted me to travel extensively and visit numerous countries in Southern Europe and the Balkans. I also met and visited a great number of very attractive English people. Right after graduation I spent a full summer of travel which was highlighted by a six weeks’ tour through Russia with an interesting group. I left Russia via Leningrad and proceeded to travel through Finland and the other Scandinavian countries. - [then spent a year at the Law School where I had a good time and gave my mind some splendid exercise but I soon concluded that I did not wish to be a lawyer. After another wonderful summer of travel through most of the South American countries, I settled down to my life’s work, the newspaper business. I obtained a job in the advertising department of the New York Herald Tribune where I remained until May, 1933, when I began my present 471 ] occupation of publishing local papers on Long Island. The Tribune years were pleasant and during this time I was quite active in New York City politics. I enjoyed my associations in the New York Young Republican Club where I served on the board of governors with a fine group which included Tom Dewey and Herb Brownell. In twenty years of publishing on Long Island I’ve had a job of building and consolidation. I have purchased or started something like twenty-eight weekly newspapers in this period and have consolidated these into a much smaller number, six of which I now publish. I also conduct a commercial printing business which is a separate operation and, like the newspapers, has expanded greatly with the phenomenal growth of the area in which we operate. In this endeavor I have had to combat the hardships that we have all faced. My business was conceived in a depression and born during a banking crisis. It suffered through years of New Deal antagonism to free enterprise, new and increasing taxes, and four years of war during which I was away in the Army Air Forces. Various controls which began in that war and only recently were lifted added to our problems. We had our share, too, of labor troubles, culminating in a critical strike. Yet during this twenty-year period our gross business has increased a thousand per cent, and our circulation gains have been excellent. Ican sum it all up by saying it has been a rewarding experience. There is a great opportunity for public service in publishing local newspapers and I enjoy the great variety of the work. has chosen the same place in which to develop a sizeable property. I refer to John Fox who has distinguished himself in the financial and real estate world and needs no introduction by me. He, too, by the way, is a newspaper publisher. I enjoy this place in Maine tremendously and usually go there for short trips in the spring for the fishing, in the summer for a family vacation, and in the fall for bird shooting and deer hunting. I have done a lot of mountain climbing, have become a member of the Appalachian Trail Conference and am responsible for maintaining a seven-mile section of the Trail over three mountain peaks. Elow long I shall be able to keep this up I don’t know as ",Sophie M. Gay,1925-1927,LJK2-3R4,0.9998671

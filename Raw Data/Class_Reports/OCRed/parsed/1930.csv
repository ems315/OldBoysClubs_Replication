When friends left our outfit and removed the uniform, they were different. They were back ready for the vicissitudes of life. Too bad the same esprit de corps doesn’t exist more untversally in our every-day living. Having seen such fine people in the Navy, I refused to return to New York City. My wife and I arranged for our son and daughter to be taken care of during the summer of 1946, and we toured 16,000 miles through the United States trying to decide where we wanted to live. Barbara’s only stipulation was that it had to be on an ocean. In the end, after getting offers of twentyfour jobs, we chose Portland, Maine. It’s hard country economically, but it’s a good place to bring up children. Here they could attend public school after twelve years of private schooling. Incidentally, ’ve never lived in a more gracious community. At first, I worked as understudy of the manager of a set-up paper box manufacturing company. For five years now, because of economics, I’ve been selling paper products, cordage and packaging materials and ideas in Maine for the H. J. Dowd Company of Cambridge, Massachusetts. But what has my college education given me? Really two premises which came from History I, and several conclusions. Friskie Merriman and others were really trying to teach us that there has been, is now, and will continue to be a constant battle between the individual and the state, plus “in unity there is strength.” What is communism, except a new approach to the sales technique of the state? The worst thing in life is poverty. How eradicate it— through the state on a collective basis. If your present government won’t do this through ballots, then join them in overthrowing it by bullets. But what happens to the individual? He and she are subjected to the state to the point of becoming slaves. Is there any guarantee that slavery will alleviate poverty? History hasn’t proved it would. Our own country is really the only place on earth where the teachings of a rebel named Christ “that man is created in the image of God,” and therefore is free, has prevailed. It is the only place where most poverty has been eliminated. Collectivism may, for a time, improve the condition of poverty, but what is the price on individual 978 ] occuPATION: Mechanical engineer",Laura Andrews Herrick,1926-1930,LYJF-YGN,0.845581

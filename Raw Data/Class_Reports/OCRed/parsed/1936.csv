Three tours of duty in Cambridge as teacher and research worker, two in New York, once in empirical research and once in business, and two in Washington, once in wartime intelligenceoriented economic research, and once as an international civil servant for the International Monetary Fund. In spite of the many oscillations and apparent variety, there has been a high degree of unity in my activities. That unity derives from my interest in economic analysis, both theory and practice, and the many job shifts have simply been alterations between theory and practice. Now I juggle both theory and practice at the same time. I teach economic theory to practically oriented students of management at the School of Industrial Management at M.I.T., and I keep my hand in practical problems as economic adviser to CBS. On the substantive side, I try to balance my interest in applied economics with the study, as yet embryonic, of the foundations of welfare judgments. By that I mean an inquiry into the sort of considerations by which a social arrangement, such as the competitive system, or for that matter, democratic government, can be evaluated in comparison with possible alternatives. There is a substantial body of economic doctrine, in the theory of economic welfare, which deals with the problem of how given wants of individuals can be best (most economically) satisfied. But the doctrine starts from the assumption of given wants, and it leaves open the question of how important it is to satisfy those wants. Once the problem is viewed more broadly, it becomes obvious that the merit of want satisfaction depends on the desirability of the wants. The wants themselves are generated largely by the social framework, not least by the economy itself as it operates to satisfy the wants",Edna Ann Simon,1932-1936,,

I, Bernard Rothwell Baldwin, have had a full life since leaving college. I started my business career by taking an insurance course at the Employers Liability Company, Boston. They then gave me experience by working in various departments for practical purposes. Meanwhile, I started a little brokerage business. War came and with it the regular routine of living was interrupted. I entered naval service and saw action aboard a destroyer escort from Newfoundland to South America after having trained four months. I was later shipped to New Guinea and was in on the invasion of the Philippines. At this time I was an aide to Captain Gillette of the Philippine Sea Frontier. Another Harvard fellow and I were the only non-Annapolis on the staff. All in all I was gone three and a half years; of that time, a year and a half was spent in the Pacific. I returned from the war weighing 129 pounds as a result of several bouts of malaria. I returned to insurance and on the side started to rebuild my own accounts. It was slow at first but gradually my own business de. manded more time and eventually I went on my own. I have made 67 ] bonding a part of my business with my own offices in downtown Boston. In 1939 I married Marion Randall McCarthy and have a son seventeen, and two daughters, sixteen and ten respectively. I enjoy my family and we do many things together. My son is in his final year at Deerfield Academy and my daughters are in convent schools, one in Washington, D.C, and the youngest in Newton. _ My interests are varied politically and socially. I am a Democrat but with an open mind as to issues and candidates. I was fairly active in the Kennedy campaign in Boston. At the moment, I am president of a golf club, vice-president of a large charitable organization, and a former chairman of sports events for the Chamber of Commerce. A few years ago I was on the Port Authority of Boston.

I was the father of a son, sales manager of a brick company, and a commuter with Mac Millard when Mac dropped over one Sunday morning to say that what had seemed likely to us in our talks on the train had actually happened — Pearl Harbor. I joined the Army, went to non-com school, then OCS at Fort Benning, and eventually served in France and Germany as S-2 of the First Battalion, 232d Infantry. We had a good outfit. The experience remains the most vivid and nearly the most prized of my life. Not that I want to repeat it. On my return to civilian life, my marriage started downhill and finally ended in divorce. At college, Bernard DeVoto spoke kindly of my possibilities as a 94 writer, and since the war I’ve been trying to vindicate his judgment — and my own. My stories have appeared 1 in first-rate magazines, but not often. In addition, I’m active in a family business of which I am a director. Since that business provides my living, I list myself as a capitalist, though the word sounds a bit odd to me",Mary Wallace,1932-1937,,

WE doctors may seem destined to live a life apart in spite of normalcy and a fair range of interests, for patients expect gravity and a concern for their myriad problems, I’m reminded of The Doctor Has Three Faces and have long suspected that most mature adults, i.e., semi-conventional and reasonably successful, comprise a number of different personalities. Perhaps the professional image will disappear when an all-powerful and supposedly understanding bureaucracy has carefully partitioned medical complexities and practitioners so that we shall no longer be human physicians but dull, well-regulated personnel. 96 J We may have looked upon college largely as a premedical course of study and are, therefore, surprised and delighted with news of our classmates’ accomplishments — often dramatic. Meeting Harvard men or reading of their appointments and other successes always provides the warm personal pleasure of kinship. Finding former instructors Tishler and Barnes in key industrial spots — one with an important pharmaceutical concern and the other at MMM Company — is a recent example pointing up the high caliber of Harvard teaching and taking me back a moment to the laboratories in Mallinckrodt.

Nothing world shattering, in so far as it reflects only what has happened to me, What happened? Plenty! Aside from the physical appearance, other things surely have changed.

I AM about to conclude my twenty-third year as a teacher. I am happy to report that the profession today is as fascinating as it was when I started. The rewards have been rich in everything except salary. Several years ago I started writing short essays entitled “When Momma Goes to Work,” purely for family dinner table chit-chat. Well, “Momma” up and went to work and now I discover that I get to the battered typewriter only to dust it off occasionally. By way of revenge, my good wife has impressed us all into her service grading the papers of her active fifth-graders! The year’s end will mark two decades of ceaseless activity in guiding youngsters to Harvard. On my own initiative in the beginning, but since 1946 by active association with the Harvard Club of Long Island, several dozen excellent graduates of Erasmus Hall High School have gone on to Harvard. All were scholars and a few excelled in baseball and track and, what’s more, have become Harvard men of distinction. My hobbies have been stamp collecting, coaching sports, letter writing and Civil War literature. The stamp collection has grown very slowly but my twelve-year-old son Michael’s interest has become aroused because of his love for geography and history so that I have become optimistic about the future of our plate blocks and first-day covers. I have always been sports-minded, perhaps because I was early impressed with the creed of the ancient Athenians, “to possess a sound mind in a sound body.” Although most of the spring has left the pitching arm and my legs, enough still remains to permit me to play an active part in our community’s Little League. Last year our Robins A team needed only one more victory to run a three-year streak to thirty games but flopped dismally in the last game, 18-10. Some of the parents nearly demanded a Congressional investigation. Next year, like so many other fathers, I move up from Little League to the Babe Ruth League for similar coaching and managerial chores. Who knows, Michael may { 200 ] 2§TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT in a few years be holding down first base or pitching for the Crimson team (or Dartmouth). I have, for many years, written letters and cards to presidents, governors, ambassadors, legislators (federal and state) when moved by some press or radio item. It has been lots of fun but not too rewarding. Most of the replies have come back full of gobbledygook, printed enclosures “full of sound and fury signifying nothing,” so that I have often wondered whether it had been worth the time and the expense taken. Of all the correspondence, the most rewarding were a beautiful three-page letter from the late Kenneth Roberts of Kennebunkport, Maine, a genuine letter of appreciation from President Karl Ebert of Switzerland in 1946 in response to my thanking him for the quick work of the Swiss Army and Alpine guides in rescuing all the occupants of a U.S. Air Force plane down in the Alps, and several sincere letters from Bruce Catton to whom I had addressed queries about Civil War events.

SO where have these golden twenty-five years gone? My life would provide material for a series of comic valentines. The photo above (a stiff, contrived affair) reveals the marks of character I have acquired — puffy eyes, tension wrinkles, saggy jowls, fat neck, thin hair. Not shown are the benchmarks of the Highly Developed Commuter — sprung sacroiliac, wafflefanny, vestigial legs. Nor the inner scars of twenty-odd years as a writer, paterfamilias, garbagecanstuffer, lawnsprinkler, weedmower, checkwriter. I am a copy writer in an advertising agency. As a wordsmith, I have the typewriter-trained fingers, the shadowed baggy eyes, the side pocket full of paper clips, the pencil always in hand even though it is just for waving in conversation, the office bag or attaché case on my lap during the train ride home at night. Plus the twitches and shakes, the witchridden nights of the professional creative man. 233 ] When the coroner finally dissects me, out will pour a gallon of coffee, $17.00 worth of tranquilizers, and enough Super Potency vitamin pills to string a necklace for a Zulu medicine man. My home is in a sweet little hamlet on Long Island Sound, which is connected by the New Haven railroad tracks, as if by a damaged sciatic nerve, to the island of New York fifty miles away. Once in the stimulating metropolis, I lean against a desk for seven hours, enduring a swarm of people who buzz about me demanding bits of copy which I promise for 3:00 p.M., knowing full well nothing will be written until two days later. (No matter anyway — it’s going to be pawed over like a pile of neckties on a bargain counter before our own office geniuses and our client geniuses decide it is sufficiently garbled for publication.) ° Such are my days, such are the facts of my life — but they don’t tell the tale. In every one of these biographies, the real story is inevitably a summary, a judgment: “What has this guy done with the best quarter-century of his life?” The only objective answer on this must come from others who know us. Wherefore, I turn this re port over to those closest tome... MY WIFE — North has been many things, but he’s housebroken now. Mostly he’s a gentle, tumultuous rebel with sinus troubles and a stout faith in Doing Things the Hard Way. Thirty minutes before dark, he'll decide that the dead birch in the front yard has to come out and nine other families in the neighborhood have late dinners that night because all the husbands are out marveling at the confusion of chains, wire cables, crossed timbers lashed together, pickaxes and shovels with which he has blocked the road. By this time, he will have both cars out there with headlights on, and the whole scene looks like a disaster area—all for one little tree",Elizabeth Butler,1931-1933,,

TO bring back to memory highlights of twenty-five years is asking a lot, but here’s the old college try. After leaving the hallowed halls along the Charles, I spent many a month making the futile rounds of newspapers, magazines, etc., in a vain attempt to lay the cornerstone for my career as a movie critic. Gave it all up to join the textile company, Cohn-Hall-Marx, whence, after three and a_ half years of acquiring the necessary experience for my proposed future, I went into the ladies’ robe business with my father. In 1941, married Frankie Block and received a reprieve from Uncle Sam that lasted fourteen months (the reprieve, not the marriage! ), In January, 1943, I was invited to join the Army Ordnance Department and spent nine months in Augusta, Georgia, learning to be a soldier. Having made the grade, I was ordered overseas and before you could say “809th Ordnance Company” we were in Calcutta, India, after a six-week trip via Oran and Bombay. After a few months, four of us founded the first G.I. newspaper in India, The Command Post, and here, finally, I achieved my lifelong ambition (?). I became an accredited motion picture critic — the easy 253] way, After a tour as house officer in surgery at the Massachusetts Memorial Hospitals in Boston, he was beginning a residency in genitourinary surgery when called to active duty in the Army.

""Nevertheless, I am deeply grateful to the University for the scholarships which made my attendance there possible. These scholarships — plus some meager savings — took care of my tuition, but I had still to earn my living expenses. Accordingly, I lived off-campus in a cheap rooming house and paid for my room and board by various menial jobs, This left me neither time nor money to engage in any extracurricular or social activities, so that my college years were literally “all work and no play.” After graduation, I discovered with extreme dismay that employment opportunities were few and far between and that mv Harvard education was inadequate to cope with this situation, I, therefore, spent the next three years (1936-39) doing graduate work 429 ] in physics (my major subject) and in education, continuing to live in an austere, hand-to-mouth fashion on graduate assistantships and whatever summer jobs I could find, There followed a frustrating period of job-hunting, a year of high school teaching, nearly two years of work in an aircraft factory, culminating in three years of service in the Army Air Force (1943-46). At no time during the eight-year period from 1938 to 1946 did I have an opportunity to make any significant use of my training in physics. In the Army, I heard rumors that there was a shortage of technically trained men, but apparently this shortage was not severe enough to persuade the military authorities to assign me to a position requiring scientific training",Shirley Maltz,1932-1936,,

I, for one, had that hope dashed when I accepted a “position” four days after Commencement in an insurance brokerage house. Did I say “position’’? My choice of words could not be more inaccurate. It was a job and I guess I was lucky to have one. However, what I did not realize at that time was that I was practically useless as far as contributing to the company’s profits went. This coupled with the depression caused a few lean years. Either I was too stubborn or stupid or lacked the fortitude to attempt other work because I am still in the same office and I must admit that I am now glad that I did not change.

IN 1932 I entered Harvard bent on becoming a surgeon; however, in 1934 the family funds vanished — and the surgeon. During the next two depression years I pumped gasoline and tried various selling jobs; then in 1936 I entered the banking business with the Boston Safe Deposit & Trust Company. During the first years with the bank I spent my evenings at the Bentley School of Accounting and Finance, graduating in 1939 as ninth in a class of about 300, all of which led to various jobs as treasurer, looking after other people’s funds, but none of which were too lucrative. After twelve years of banking, progressing from messenger to assistant tax officer (the present title for the position), I was wooed into the more hazardous industrial field. I started with my present employer in 1948, as assistant in the insurance, pension and tax department. As the three elements of this department expanded, the tax responsibility was transferred to the controller’s office where I am now the company tax adviser. As my family began to grow up as well as expand, I bought a Victorian ark in Walpole, just two blocks from my office. I enjoy my walk to and from the office, as well as my luncheons at home. The house is bright and sunny, but most of all it is roomy enough for our four children and their paraphernalia, including pets. We enjoy the life of our small town with all the busyness one has with children, school, church, Scouts and such. The oldest boy, sixteen, leans toward flying. He received his automobile driver’s license one week and his pilot’s license the next. He is now at the Barrington School, in the Berkshires, with his wings clipped until next summer.

She has just enough exquisitely, unexpected, Irish backlash in her system to keep me at parade rest — and, thank God, she can spell. There are three not-so-small Garbers who fight, swim, sail, fish, water-ski, shoot and do all the other things that the young and beautiful can do in this salt-sown shore country. One lovely blonde female is a freshman at Oberlin; one boy (our middle child) wants to be an electronics engineer; his younger brother, who has built and sold two boats at thirteen, dreams of being a naval architect. As to conformity, I can only say that they were baptized and confirmed, and in varying degrees have attended services in the same Episcopal parish where their mother and J took our vows two decades ago. I have been successful financially in the way of the day: have been an officer and director of a major department store group, an officer of a well-known manufacturing company and two large national advertising agencies, On the other side of the cuff, 1 once spent a couple of unhurried, if financially harried, years as a member of the graduate school faculty of one of our better universities",Eleanore Constance Mackey,1932-1935,,

AT Class Day, 1936, on beholding the rather elderly members of the Class of 1911, I was appalled. “Will we look like that at our Twenty-fifth?” My own answer comes a quarter-century late, and I think all the pictures in this volume will provide supporting evidence. My 36 friends and I may have gained a few tons collectively; yet despite war and other crises they seem very far removed from decrepitude. As another phase of the continuum, my business chronology began more or less in a social psy ch course, under Professor Allport, which stirred my interest in advertising and broadcasting. It proceeded through a senior thesis on advertising psychology, followed later by a $15-a-week job showing tourists Major Bowes’ studio and other NBC wonders.

The terminal date for reaching one’s goals was certainly not later than one’s Twenty-fifth Reunion, because I had attended my father’s Twenty --fifth and knew how old those men were. In twenty-five years the goals have changed, as do most unrealized objectives. And the “terminal date” has become a starting point, as 1 look forward to the next twenty-five.

MY fractious nature manifested itself immediately after graduation, when having received a degree in engineering I spent four years trying to be a writer. Failure to advance beyond a $20-a-week job as a copy boy, combined with the responsibility of supporting a wife, led me to put aside my great American novel and take a job as a riveter at the Glenn L. Martin Company in Baltimore. While this wasn’t exactly the work that Harvard had tried to prepare me for, at least it was in the area of building things. Apparently, it was also better suited to my abilities, for I was soon promoted to draftsman and was well on the way to an administrative position when, once again, a willful streak set me on quite a different path. I had taken up skiing and suffered the usual prattfalls — sore muscles, bumps, and bruises — that inflict those who try to master this noble sport. Unlike other beginners, however, founded heavy we'd both be F.LS. team candidates in no time at all. He, a more humble person, remained unconvinced, but the more | argued the more certain I became. Mv work in aircraft engineering at Martin put the problem of designing a lightweight ski nghe up my alley. So, with a need for distraction in the aftermath of divorce I rented space in a garage in downtown Baltuumore, bought S00 worth of machinery, and went to work. The difficulties turned out to be so great that only a mule-like obstinacy kept me from giving up the whole idea.

I got a Ph.D. in 1940 and have been on the faculty at the University of California ever since. My special field is nuclear physics, at present high energy nuclear physics. During the war I participated in the Manhattan Project, trying to separate uranium isotopes. For the past five years I have been chairman of the Physics Department and so have spent most of my time on administration and not nearly enough on research. I continue teaching classes and enjoy it very much. The last few summers I have taught in institutes for high school teachers, which is rewarding, but there is a long way to go. My present views are that we have to teach a lot more in high schools (and in colleges too); that the trend toward graduate work for more people is not an unmixed blessing; that the average man needs to know more science more than the scientist needs to know more humanities. I have been very happily married since 1938 to Betty Little H., who also comes from Minnesota. We have four children, the oldest of whom is a girl who is twenty and will graduate in 1961 from Scripps College; the second, a boy eighteen, a freshman at Wesleyan, the third, a boy fourteen, at Thacher School, and the fourth, a girl twelve, in the local seventh grade. We are justifiably, we think, proud of them all and enjoy them very much. I play tennis some but not nearly enough. My game is sliding slowly down hill though Betty and I are still a fairly good mixed doubles team. Tennis brings me into contact once a year with Harvard when I play in the annual match against Yale. We usually win the tennis but often don’t fare so well in baseball, etc. My daughter got us started skiing, and although all the children now 626 } ski better than we do, we enjoy it and go quite often (nothing east of Alta as yet). I have taken a fair share of faculty administrative duties. The only thing I am really proud of was the improvement of the university’s retirement system in which I had some hand.

I was fortunate upon graduation to be able to travel to many of the untroubled spots soon to be engulfed in turmoil, and due to a bit of miscalculation on wintry conditions in the Bavarian Alps I spent my first post-grad year soaking up Tucson air at the University of Arizona. My first astonishing discovery after entering the Business School was the con job we undergraduates had been given by the graduate students regarding the undesirability of dating Radcliffe girls. From that moment on Business School not only became academically acceptable but also socially enjoyable. No more of the midnight rides from Wellesley and Northampton. (I have to include Northampton as later I was to meet the one and only in that out-of-the-way locale.) Having an A.B. and an M.B.A., I now felt qualified to go into my chosen profession-— dude ranching in Wyoming — but a family tragedy intervened — I ran out of money and had to go to work instead.

After a year of grace (A.M. in Latin), I went through the conventional four years of medical school, internship and residency training, interrupted by military service in the Pacific. A year of research in neurophysiology gradually stretched out to five, confirming the prejudice in favor of university life acquired at Harvard. Following a research project I went out to Salt Lake City, never really believing that an easterner could live for long in the desert. Here I found three things that changed my mind — the first girl who ever made my bachelorhood seem empty, the first professional opportunity that seemed to ask for my kind of ideas, and the first spontaneously appealing balance between city and nature. Happily, all three have continued to be challenging. The first has produced a home and two wonderful sons. The second has brought forth the first independent effort in neurology at the University of Utah.

IN the summer of 1935, along with a clutch of Classmates, I re charged my batteries, for Law School, by pedaling a bicycle through Europe, and in 1944 and 1945, the Army furnished an even more inexpensive tour of approximately the same places, with the 82d Airborne Division. Even the second expedition now begins to appear a blessing (somewhat disguised at the time), because my whole tendency since has been to anchor myself in one place. I live in the house I was born in; my specialty is real estate law (and, if there is any branch of law which confines the specialist to his own commonwealth, it is real estate); and the hostages to fortune enumerated 714 above preclude adventuring. Fortunately, I like my hostages and my specialty, and the house has come to fit me like an old shoe. I say no more about the hostages for fear of spoiling them. There is no fear of spoiling the specialty; it will take care of itself, although some of my fellow-specialists occasionally give signs of wishing that I would abandon my semi-professional hobby of tinkering with it by drafting legislation designed to take some of the mystery out of it. I like to dream of the day when we get it classified to the point that some Classmate in the computer business can design one which will tell the state of a man’s title to land as quickly and accurately as the state of his checking account. The above-mentioned fellowspecialists fear that I may be heading myself and them for technological unemployment, but I am sure that as long as land is owned by humans they will be thinking up land deals with each other for lawyers to describe — either in English or in codes",Chloe Tyler Walker,1932-1936,LRJ5-CC4,0.94362265

Before V-J Day, I did a lot of war writing on the Corps, mostly for the Iufantry Journal. Also, | did some books. The best I think was The Long and the Short and the Tall, published by Knopf in 1946. Chapters from it are regularly reprinted here and there. I also sold something again to MGM and once more went to California to write for the movies. I could not find a place to live, however, and for six months after I got out of uniform, it was very rough. I was separated again from my wife and daughter (who had been born when I was in boot camp). They stayed in Washington as long as we could take it. Then they came on, but things did not work out well in some very cramped quarters. It ended in separation, divorce — and eventually in a new and happy marriage and three more fine children. Fortunately, my first daughter never ceased being a part of my family and is still with me most of the time when she’s not at school. I was a staff writer at MGM for about four years, then at Warner’s and United Artists, and finally teamed up with director Mark Robson and others to make an independent picture. At the same time, I became interested in a string of weekly papers around Los Angeles and edited them. It got me mixed up in west coast crime and politics. In 1951, during a visit to New York I was invited to join the editorial staff of Tire magazine to help start the color pages and a new feature called “News in Pictures.” I moved from Santa Monica to Greenwich, Connecticut, where my wife had been born and raised, and I stayed with Time until January 1, 1960, as an associate editor. In the meantime, I had developed interests in conservation, the American Indian, and the history of the early United States west, and spent much time studying and writing on all three subjects. My avocation at length became my vocation, and in 1960 I joined American Heritage.

Having concentrated in English at Harvard and obtained an A.M. in the same subject at Chicago, | moved to the front of the classroom and taught English, from 1938 to 194s, at a high school in Chicago and later at Brooklyn Polytechnic Insutute and the College of the City of New York. During my military service, however, the Air Force and the Army scized upon my training in psychology, and I was assigned for some time to psychological research involving the simultaneous testing of large groups. Ie so happened that at about the same time, I wrote a couple of radio plays for a local station. My own background and the general milieu at the time created in me an interest in scientifically determining the psychological and social effects of mass communication, and J have been concerned with this ever since, which is to say for fifteen years. My interest in social research led me out of English and into sociology. Between 1946 and 1951, I variously pursued research at the Bureau of Applied Social Research (Columbia Univernity ) and taught sociology at the University of Washington and at Stanford. From 1951 to 1954, I served in several capacines with the evaluation sections of the Voice of America, eventually becoming chief of the Media Evaluation Unit, which was concerned with assessing the effects of the programs on overseas audiences. During the next three years (1954-57), I again pursued mass communication research at the Bureau of Applied Social Research (Columbia) and decided, despite my advanced years, to equip myself with a Ph.D). in sociology. (Part-time pursuit of this required ages, and have accordingly served as a consultant (this time in the usual sense of the term) to a variety of voluntary, governmental, academic and commercial groups (for example, the Department of State, Department of Agriculture, National Council of Churches of Christ, American Jewish Committee, Child Study Association, Television Bureau of Advertising, National Health Council, and such like). J have been quite active in the American Association for Public Opinion Research, have been on the executive council since 1951, and have been secretary-treasurer since 1956.

I have a wife and three children, a house with a mortgage, and a responsible position in the engineering profession. All in all, it would seem that I must at least be “holding my own.” Much more than that, I cannot claim, yet my hopes for the future are still high. In the civil engineering profession (not the most lucrative right now), I have reached a sort of plateau, not as high as could be wished, where something drastic must be done if ] am going to move upwards again. In short, I’ve come about as far as is possible for me in the local Boston area while working for someone else. ‘Two courses of action appear open to me: to look to other areas, perhaps far afield, or to organize an engineering business with others or by myself; in short, to become management.

The war, however, dislodged me from mathematics into the field of physics, where I have remained ever since. 1000 } _—— 2§TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT The second half of World War III spent working at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, where I was introduced to rockets and missiles. In early 1946 the Laboratory began a program of rocket sounding of the upper atmosphere, Toward the end of 1947, I became head of the branch at NRL that was carrying out the upper atmosphere research program. In this position it was my privilege to share in the early development of high altitude rocket research, a development that has now expanded into the exploration of outer space by means of rockets, satellites and space probes. My branch was responsible for the de ‘velopment of the Viking rocket. While we did much of our rocket work at the White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico, nevertheless we carried our activity to far corners of the earth. Members of the group fired research rockets in the Arctic, the Atlantic, at Fort Churchill in Canada and from the Pacific Ocean. In fact, we took the Viking to the middle of the Pacific Ocean, where in 1950 it was launched from the deck of the USS Norton Sound, near Jarvis Island",Janice May Hurd,1932-1936,,

A FEW years ago — it may have been when Susan, my elder daughter, started wearing lipstick in earnest — I called time, took the phone off the hook, and asked myself the full battery of serious questions, starting with Which end is up? and ending with Why bother? I reached some sobering conclusions but I continued in much the 1392 ] same way afterward, as people will. And so it will undoubtedly prove this time. My daughter still wears lipstick, although it is now so pale you would hardly know it is there. She is a freshman at Barnard where she is being taught to fence on the off-chance that it will come in handy some day. My next daughter, Mary, seems to have her third-grade teacher well in hand. My son James has a nice hop on his fast ball but is having trouble controlling his slider. My youngest child is a boy in arms with great charm, we feel, and a constructive attitude toward Harvard mail. He eats it. To complete the introductions, I am still married to my original wife and I don’t mean that to sound like a negative achievement. I began my professional life on magazines in New York. Like most writers of my generation, I served time in Tame, Inc. Since the end . of our war, I have been on nobody's payroll but my own. This means that when I feel a cold coming on and decide not to go into the office I don’t get paid. I operate an electric typewriter which gives off a low hum to remind me that time is passing. I try to serve it as well as I can, but the odd thing about almost all the books I write is that nobody gives a damn whether they are done well or badly. The literary sub-species to which I belong —and after all these years I still hope it is temporary — is known as suspense. This is a misleading label as no group of novels is so totally lacking in real suspense. The hero gets into jams, true, but a reader would have to be very naive indeed not to know who will be in bed with the heroine in the last chapter and who will be dead. A New York Times expert, reviewing a group of books which probably included one or two of mine, said recently, “I am increasingly beginning to suspect that we may be on the threshold of the golden aye of the suspense story.” I have sympathy for the man and his SUSPICIONS may be justified, but I wish we were on the threshold of the golden age of something else",Joan Thomas,1932—1936,KPSJ-73W,0.9814181

AN optimist with a strong streak of fatalism, I generally hold that this is the best of all possible worlds, but in weaker moments I have considered how thin is the line between Pangloss and Job. I have been fortunate in many ways. My bride of these many years is a sensitive lady of great perception (ie. she sees through me), tempered with understanding and tolerance. Our two sons are a source of pride, although I note with some disbelief that they beat me at chess with increasing frequency and are often better informed on baseball, the Civil War and existentialism, to name just a few subjects. I have been fortunate at my work. This may not have been obvious when I left the Harvard Graduate School in 1938, apathetically abandoning a career in biology for a job selling premiums and advertising, nor four years later when I returned to scientific work, with a very considerable reduction in pay. The next year was spent on pharmaceutical chemical research, mainly extracting female sex hormones from thousands of gallons of pregnant mare urine. Chemistry was stimulating, but I was becoming terribly self-conscious about the unremovable stench. With a new sense of direction at last, I sought fresher, less odoriferous fields, where with devotion and application I rose to the post of research director for a small com pany in industrial chemistry — then began moving into sales work again. For the past eleven years, I have been associated with the American branch of an ancient and distinguished Swiss chemical organization. Having attained a very modest degree of material success, I am now an armchair chemist-salesman-administrator, still 1586 working hard but deriving some little sansfacaon from what Tho yw is a useful and certainly challenging life",Bernice Brickman,1932-1933,,

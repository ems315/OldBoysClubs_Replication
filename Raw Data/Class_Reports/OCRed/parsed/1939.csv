I took a horribly long time at getting my doctorate at Harvard, the difficulties being compounded of several factors; the interval of war service (I entered the V-7 midshipman training —ihesttmamaniats program in ’42 and emerged as a lieutenant at the end of the war), my own sloth and stupidity, and a rather heavy program as a teaching fellow. I think that I, more than anyone else, am responsible for Harvard’s decision to eliminate the full-time teaching fellowship; after their experience with me they decided that teaching only half-tume was reasonably compatible with the completion of graduate work. In the process, however, I did discover that teaching is what I want to do. Its joys really defy analysis: it has something to do with that occasional glimpse of a countenance lighted by unwonted comprehension, something to do with one’s own vanity and the delight of communicating one’s own views and making oneself understood, and, I'm afraid, something to do with the security of one’s situation —the possession of a captive audience held in the thralldom of grades. For the last ten years I’ve been teaching at Simmons College in Boston. It’s a women’s college, as some of you may know, and a good one, and I’m very happy there; in some ways teaching girls is much more fun than teaching boys. As for the rest of it, it’s all very uneventful — and happy. I married a Radcliffe classmate who herself will be celebrating her ‘I'wenty-fifth this June. We have two boys, aged fifteen and thirteen, both perplexing, gratifying and annoying in turn, as boys will be. Janet, my wife, stood housework as long as she was able and when finally our younger son entered the first grade she too went back to school, where she has been ever since, teaching mathematics at Brookline High. She does it, I know, wonderfully well and is quite happy at it. A few more words about myself: I have lately been conscious of the fact that I am aging. It’s not so much the gray hair and the paunch (though I must regretfully acknowledge them) as it is a matter of attitude. I find myself suspecting that the theatre, movies, the best-sellers of the day are not what they were a couple of decades ago—and yet I’m horrified at the thought of becoming a “crier of times past.” I cleave to the tenets of my youth, for instance, the radicalism and agnosticism of an age gone by, in this era of conformism, the organization man and church-going that make me aware of being old-fashioned, passé, behindthe-times. To conclude this melancholic self-appraisal let me add that more and more I value the qualities of the home: comradeship, tranquility and peace",,EDWARD HARRIS ADDELSON,Associate professor of French language and literature,,,Janet B.

Tt hardly seems possible that twenty-five years have slipped by so quickly. 1 must confess that there were occasions in the past when time seemed at a standstill, particularly when, by devious paths, my attempts to achieve standing and recognition met successive butts and frustration. It’s obvious when I look back now what my direction and concentration should have been, because once the true course was set, the goal was not long in reaching. "" 10 After graduation I enrolled at the Harvard Dental School in the fall of 1939. This course of study was undoubtedly my field because I made top honors, was awarded the Eugene Hanes Smith Scholarship and the Harvard Dental School Alumni Association Medal for highest achievement, and was elected to Omicron Kappa Upsilon Honorary Dental Fraternity. These were war years and in 1942 I was listed as second lieutenant, MAC.

This has been especially tough on me since I came from what is known as a “good family.” And even in Boston a “good family” is one, as all my loyal readers know, that used to be better. My father, Robert Amory, was Ought Six, and even he ought to have known better than to author an author son. In any case, after the publication of my first book, The Proper Bostonians, my entire family had to take to the hills, and if my father was able to stay in New York and come back from time to time to Boston for director meetings, my sister had no such luck and had to go all the way to California. My aunts also moved west—to Wellesley Hills and Natick. As for my brother, Robert Amory Jr., he is now, like all good Harvard men, in Washington. He is Deputy Director of the Budget, where, as I understand it, his job is to divert as large a proportion as possible of the taxpayers’ money to the Harvard Alumni Association. I am, I suppose, a satirist— which my wife has defined as someone . who makes jokes sitting down. I am also, however, a free-lance writer, and since the statistics of the Authors League of America show that there are only 250 people in the country who are free-lance writers, I am extremely proud, in this increasingly conforming world, to be one of them. If I write regularly for many publications and commentate regularly for a number of television and radio shows, the editors of the magazines and the producers of the shows well know that, though they may edit me, they do not own me. And they also know, from the occasions when they have disowned me, that I am not without other outlets with which, if not to fight back, at least to write back. Dr. Johnson once said that no one but a blockhead ever wrote for anything but money and with this I heartily agree. Nonetheless, I have never taken on a single assignment in which money was the primary consideration — or, for that matter, in which the consideration in any wav got in my way. All this has meant, it is true, some lean years, but despite a couple of wild, desperate thoughts in that direction, I have never once stooped so low as to dip into capital. In 1952 I married Martha Hodge, the daughter of the late actor Wil 22 liam Hodge. She had the misfortune to be born in New York, but I have been very nice about it. I try to rise above it and rarely mention it, although of course I have raised both her and my stepdaughter Gaea doubly carefully, on a diet of a wide variety of Boston homilies — my favorites being, “Wear it out, eat it up, make do and do without.” Once in @ while, despite my tact, however, they apparently have enough of these, and one day my wife said to me, “You know, it is a funny thing",Cora Craddock,,,

Like others in that kind of situation, where one’s recreation is the same as one’s work and where so much of one’s work consists of writing, I find myself unable ever to say what I’m doing without falling into a long rambling summary of everything I’ve been trying to talk or write about it, long and rambling because one starts to use the opportunity to qualify or try to improve on what one’s already said. That’s the occupational disease. I suppose I could say that my principal hope, for years, has been to discover means by which we can pick our way through the large written record of man that we call literature, and to evaluate it — means by which we can see it for what it is worth and profit from it. The interest, in other words, is in the humanistic use of the humanities. I sometimes feel that I’m gradually making a little headway. But usually the effect is to reduce one back to size and toward increased humility",Gladys F. Hinds,1935-1939,,

My company is engaged in manufacturing and distributing popular priced children’s wear and bathing suits to major retailers. My business is most demanding of my energies and time. Its inherent defect is that it is successful as long as (and only if) I personally give it concentrated effort. If success is measured in dollar bills, I guess I “made” it. I rather think that success, however, is a combination of many other achievements, quite a few of which I have not yet attained, the foremost of which is having time — time to relax, time to think, time to do nothing. I recognize more fully the significant and real values in life as 1 get older.

My life since college days can be divided into four quite separate periods, each of which has proved interesting, demanding and rewarding. I regard mvself as a very lucky man because life has provided me with recurring opportunities to work very hard at responsibilities which I have enjoyed. 1. I first spent three years at the Harvard Law School. For me this was a golden period in which my intellectual interests were at their - brightest. The Law School launched me into professional life at so high a peak of enthusiasm and so taut a state of mental discipline that almost ail problems have seemed relatively easy since. 2. Three years in the U.S. Army Air Corps followed, mostly in the European Theatre of Operations as a staff officer with two headquarters in the Ninth Air Force. This was a great opportunity to Jearn about people and about large-scale administration. In retrospect, a major educational experience which provided a human and practical counterbalance to the intellectual life of the Law School. 3. 1 then spent sixteen years at the practice of law in New York City. As time moved on my practice became a curious, almost unique, mixture of diverse interests. On one hand, I was adviser on corporate and financial matters; on the other, I was counsel for trade unions, nonprofit groups, and real estate investors interested in slum clearance, low-cost housing, and urban redevelopment. This was absorbing, lively, and not uninteresting from the financial point of view. At this time, I assumed that the future pattern of my professional life was settled. 4. However, the sudden death of the president of one of my most important clients resulted in my election on a few days notice as president of Kirkeby-Natus Corporation. This was a corporation with $34,000,000 net worth, representing the proceeds of the sale of the hotel and heating businesses of two predecessor companies, which was developing a major financing business with certain novel financing concepts. I was presented with what seemed to be a unique opportunity to participate in the creation of a major American enterprise, This was a challenge sufficiendy exciting to shake me loose from my law practice",,MORRIS BURGHEIM BLUMBERG,"Vice-president, Seaboard Finance Company","Director.

I am writing this post graduation biographical sketch at the halfway mark of an eight-thousand-mile transcontinental business trip. Strangely enough, it seems a particularly appropriate place for me to reflect on the ast twenty-five years. My life has been a full one. My family and I have lived a fairly typical suburban existence. From the tme my duty in the Navy was over, we have been able to live and rear our children without any moves from the home we built in 1947. As I look back, I feel grateful that we were not one of the many wandering families which our society and economy have made so common. At the same time we were able to avoid too static an existence by virtue of personal and business interests which exposed us to many outside influences. My wife and I, shortly after our family had been complete, became interested in the breeding and exhibiting of pure bred boxers. Our breeding program has been successful, having produced several of our own champions, and our activity in dog breeding organizations has taken us to many parts of the country and introduced us to people from all over the world and from all walks of life who happen to have this interest in common. More important, it has given my wife and me and to some extent our children a common interest outside of the normal family affairs. As we have matured, we have both become, as I described myself in our Twentieth Reunion Book, middle-aged athletes. Although my wife does not share my interest in squash, she is a most enthusiastic tennis partner. She is a reluctant skier, but her indifference is more than offset by the enthusiasm of my son and daughter. As a defense against my many business trips, my wife decided to become interested in silver work. She has become a talented silversmith, a talent which unfortunately I do not share. I am a great critic of her designs, but though exceedingly vocal, I have no discernible effect on the finished product",,ROBERT MANSON BUNKER,"U.S. Indian Service to 1951 (last title, social economist) ; teacher","Executive secretary, Bernalillo City-County Charter Committee, 1951-55",,Priscilla Fleitmann,1935-1939,,

In the world at large, the fury and cataclysm of World War Il—all but continuous war on smaller scales and differing stages ever since— the splitting of the Atom and all the manifold consequences thereof —the world-wide population explosion — the reconstruction and renaissance of Western Europe—the end of colonialism— the emergence of Communist China, democratic India and all the other new undeveloped states with their “revolution of rising expectations” —the exploration of space—the explosions of new products, techniques, businesses. At graduation, my immediate aim was a summer’s tour of Europe and return to a job in a New York buying office for a year. Then a year in a Boston department store, finally the Business School and my family’s department stores in Salem, Beverly and Danvers; someday to succeed my father as treasurer. How settled it all seemed, even with Hitler’s mad preparations in the back of my young mind. I expected a war, but tried to put it out of mind. ~ 1939 was a wonderful summer in England, Ireland, France, Belgium, Germany, Italy. New York that winter was hard work and fun —- away on my own. 1940 saw me back home, commuting to Boston, a junior executive in a Boston department store. 1941 saw me at the Business School and in love with Hope Osborne whom I married next year. 1942 saw me an ensign, U.S. Navy Reserve. 1943 saw me out of the Business School and into the Navy. Hope and I made a mad series of sixteen “abodes” in nine months, capped by a glorious four in San Francisco, 1944-45 saw me in Fspiritu Santo, the Admiralties, New Guinea, the Philippines, as an officer in a P.T. boat base. 1946 saw Hope and me re united in Washington (cross word puzzle section of BuOrd), Brookline, alem",,Hope Osborne,1935-1939,,

To ask a Harvard graduate to be concise about anything is ridiculous. To ask him to be concise about twenty-five years of love and labor, joy and turmoil is contrary to human nature. My conciseness or lack of it stems from the sonorous proclamations of my freshman tutor, the long, long, long decline of the Roman Empire and the loquacious disillusionment of Professor Lake’s History of the New Testament.

In January, 1941, I left Yale Law School and went to the War Department which at that time was still able to squeeze itself into the old Munitions Building on Constitution Avenue, before moving across the Potomac River to the Pentagon Building. 1 was transferred to London in 1943, where I spent the balance of my Army life working with the British in various phases of intelligence work.

Worked there for three years, studying for exams of the National Institute of Actuaries, I took over a Scout Troop in Worcester and scouting grew on me to such an extent that in October, 1942, I left insurance for professional scouting. Since I was married the same month, after returning from Schiff Reservation Training, my wife and I really started life anew together. My scouting work took me through two Councils — Norumbega during 1943-44, and what is now Tunxis Council in Connecticut, 1944-46. My first daughter, Judy, was born while we were in Winsted, Connecticut. In 1947 I left scouting to enter pharmacy with my dad who bought the drugstore in Sagamore.

In September, 1939, I entered the School of Law, Columbia University, and was elected an editor of the Columbia Law Review. From 1941 until early in 1946 I served in the Army of the United States. Service areas included the South Pacific and the Philippines. In 1947 I resumed my law study and received my degree the following year, when I was admitted to the bar of the state of New York. From then on, after mutually unsatisfactory experiences with some of the elite Wall Street firms, I began a specialization in federal taxes, primarily income tax. So far as my professional work is concerned, federal tax law is analogous to criminal law in revealing the seamier side of life, except that in federal tax cases the fraud, and the perjury, and the whole sordid mess appear at the so-called top level of society. This is in addition to the expense account bums who have the curious notion that the peasants should pick up the tab for their living expenses and deaucheries, Of course, the junior Senator from Arizona believes these ‘ame peasants should bear the entire expense of government by sub‘tituting a sales tax for the income tax. To show that he really has his fart in it he would also like to take from them their Social Security. 1S is all covered with a thin veneer of allegiance to states’ rights, the nine allegiance which caused Lee to desert the Army he was sworn © serve, oO 188 Along with Lincoln, John Fitzgerald Kennedy now belongs to the Ages. The utterly unbelievable has become fact and with it 100 years of history have been turned back. And while desperate efforts, reminiscent of the burning of the Reichstag by Hitler, are being made to identify his assassin quickly and finally as an obscure Marxist, it will remain, as long as the history of this country is written and read, the good people of Dallas, and of Birmingham, and of Jackson who, directly or indirectly, must bear the burning shame and stigma of his murder, and the murder of Evers, and the murder of the Negro children of Birmingham, just as their forebears are branded with guilt of every lynching since the guns were stilled at Appomattox.

Service in the Navy during World War II, with the Fleet Intelligence Officer in the Southwest Pacific, involved a close acquaintance with. Australia, New Guinea and the Philippines. Post-war activities (after finishing off my interrupted law school education and clerking for Judge Augustus Hand and Chief Justice Vinson) allowed me to continue my interest in the international field: I spent six years with the General Counsel’s Office in the succession of foreign aid agencies — ECA, MSA and FOA —in Washington. A year of travel and research in India served as a bridge between the role of government lawyer and that of law teacher. Since 1955, I have taught at Stanford Law School, covering subjects that range from trade regulation to commercial law, but specializing in a series of new courses that I have developed in the field of international transactions. My two casebooks in that area serve as the basis for those courses. Occasional, part-time private practice and the full-time devotion of last academic year (while on a leave of absence from the University) to practice with an internationally-minded New York law firm have kept me from getting too ivory-towerish about these subjects. I have been particularly interested in the international growth of American industry, the development of the European Common Market, and the close relationship of the United States to the Common Market, the “Outer Seven,” and to the economically underdeveloped countries of the world. In some part, this reflects a conviction that the resolution of the difficult international political problems will be eased by strengthening international economic ties. Moreover, the techniques of accommodation of conflicting national interests in the latter field may be adaptable to the former",Carmel Prashker,1935~1939,,

A new program of visual education was underway here and I was assigned to organize and promote this endeavor. However, a year later the budget was cut and my civilian career in education ended and my military career began. I started in 1942 by enlisting as a private and was sent directly to Cape Cod to help guard the Fast Coast from invasion. After a year of boredom, broken only each thirty days by a twenty-four-hour pass to the big city, I found my way to OCS and emerged as a second lieutenant, Anti-aircraft. Back to Cape Cod I went.

If 1 am honest with myself, I know that the stock taking is generally good. feeling that, despite my own successful advancement, the service was declining. I think it continues to decline although many outstanding officers are to be found in the service. My service years gave my family and me the opportunity to travel extensively, mainly in Europe. I have also traveled in the Near East, the Caribbean area, and will travel again within the year in Europe and South America. Two and one-half years at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System were intellectually profitable, after which I took my present position when it was offered in early 1962. It seems an unlikely place for me as I scarcely know a peanut from a bean; however, U.S. agricultural assistance represents about onefourth of free world economic aid to the developing countries and the financial implications are many and more sophisticated than is generally believed. For the past four years I have also taught one course per semester, first at the George Washington University where I taught basic economics and money and banking, then at the National War College and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces where I taught, and continue to teach, intermediate or advanced economic theory. I continue to find pleasure in the family, in reading and writing, in tennis, good music and good conversation. I avoid, as I would the plague, joining anything but pleasant clubs, seek privacy at every opportunity, intend to retire as soon as possible, and sincerely regret that the masses revolted with a vengeance in my time. I have done my share of civic duty, however, helping to raise funds for churches and for schools my sons have attended, working on school committees, and voting my convictions at every opportunity. I remain, I hope, a respectable Episcopalian. My political views remain fairly stable, perhaps a shade less liberal than in past years. By developing an amused philosophical detachment I have become able to tolerate most of what goes on in Washington. I will likely avoid the Reunion, not that Harvard has not left me with deep gratitude for what it gave to me nor that I think of my classmates without affection.

It is rather startling to realize that I am writing for the Twenty-fifth Anniversary Report of my class at Harvard. As I am asked to write a report on my activities and progress since then, I realize how little real progress I have made, outside of growing older and of obtaining what merely comes from living longer. I am still unmarried and [I still live in the same house with my father where I have lived since I was a bov. I served almost five years in World War II and a vear and a half in the Korean Conflict. Between these periods of military service 1 worked and went half way through law school untl 1 was recalled to active duty for the Korean Conflict. In- 1947 T also play ed Class Bo minor league baseball, My decision to put myself back in school after being 366 out for ten years was really the result of a decision half-formed while ] was in the service in World War Il, I actually was reading books on the philosophy of law at that time, but I was side-tracked while trying to make an adequate adjustment to civilian life when I was released in 1946. When I was released from the service following the Korean Conflict, I finished law school in June, 1954, and passed the bar examination the same month, Then, for the first time since graduation, my life leveled out and has been running a steady course in my work as a full-time trial attorney. I find that I am happy in my selection of law as my profession.

I find my major satisfaction not in my wealth, which is negligible, but in the tangible influence which I have been able to exert in government at all levels — local, state and national— none of which can be measured by formal titles. I derive great satisfaction in being a main pivot in President John F. Kennedy’s early career, his first Congressional campaign and his victory over the most popular Republican ever in Massachusetts (Henry Cabot Lodge). I have continued my efforts in behalf of candidates on a state level and in state government, and I have derived personal satisfaction in my service for eight years on the Cambridge School Board, and as counsel for the Massachusetts State Department of Labor and Industries. I am very fortunate in having been able to retain the one thing [ cherish more than wealth, to the acquisition of which 1 disdain to apply real effort, and this is freedom of action and thought in the areas in which I choose to apply my mind and energy. I seem to thrive on controversy, having a natural faculty for seeking what I think to be the truth and speaking as I think. My life never remains static — adventure seems to seck me out. My latest adventure (at this writing) has been aiding and collaborating with and promoting the fabulous inventions of a typically temperamental but ingenious in ventor who was thrust into my life by a series of unusual circumstances. My first real adventure, along with the rest of you, was having my law carcer interrupted by four years in the U.S. Army. (Private to first ficutenant, Furopean Theatre, gth Vactical Air Command, intelligence officer.) My second adventure after graduation from law school was as attorncy and business manager for the projects of a wealthy bur eccentric young multimillionaire who left Harvard in his sophomore year because he found the atmosphere “too Communistic and liberal” for him (his quotes). The site of our business was Tin Pan Alley, Broadway. Music and show biz for three years unmatched by Alice in Wonderland. My family life is just beginning. I am happily married to a much younger wife and expect to have a family of good size. 1 am what one well might call a late-comer in this area; yet I feel that my major accomplishments including my family are still in the future.

In 1940 Dorothy Walsh (Radcliffe 739) and 1 were married, and the next year we moved to Connecticut where I was setting up material controls for Chance Vought Aircraft Company. When Pearl Harbor exploded, aircraft was classified as an essential industry, and supervisory personnel were locked in place, so that is where I spent the war years. After V-J Day I entered Yale School of Engineering full time, receiving my degree in industrial administration in June, 1947. My wife, Dorie, had begun teaching during the war, and she completed her degree work at Yale and received her A.M. in education also in June, 1947. This is the same month that our daughter Debbie was born, so we say that all three of us attended Yale together. J spent the next four years as assistant to the vice-president of Connecticut Railway and Lighting Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut; then in 1951 conversion to direct costing, profit planning and budgeting and financial and production plans and controls. In 1958 I joined the staff of Stevenson, Jordan & Harrison, Inc., management consultants and have been happily in management consulting ever since. We moved in 1959 to Garden City, New York, on Long Island. Dorie is now head of the Social Studies Department of Herricks High School in nearby New Hyde Park. Our daughter, Debbie, now sixteen, is a junior in the Garden City High School. We are a very busy and active family, and we all find too little time to do all we would like to do.

In general I have followed the professional course I envisioned when I left college. 1 went to law school (Yale), was admitted to the bar, and have spent substantial periods in both government service and private firms. The field in which I specialize, taxation, probably would have repelled me in college, at least it did in law school. The choice was partly due to chance, and also to the observation that almost every business transaction of significance involves some knowledge of taxation. I now have a modest vested interest in its unnecessary complexity, which is always increased by legislative efforts at simplification. Tax law pre 502 sents, I think, more interesting problems than other more settled fields of law, but the objectives of tax avoidance are not always so satisfying. I married four years ago. We live in one of the most pleasant neighborhoods of New York City, Brooklyn Heights, in an apartment overlooking New York Harbor. The community is alive with special interest groups and all sorts of local controversy, about housing projects, the size of the public school, the growth and demonstrativeness of the local homosexual population, and politics.

State University, 1955. I left Harvard after my second year and entered or wormed (book variety) my way into the world of engineering. At times it seemed other fields might have offered greater financial inducement and less frustration, but my vocational interests were technical and have remained so. Sweepstakes. A degree might have made success in this field easier and perhaps my contributions would have been more world-shaking, but | doubt that I would have been happier or more content than I am now. A great deal of my work has been in air pollution control and I have a number of patents and several published papers on this subject. This makes me something rare —a Harvard chimney sweep. At other times I have worked in chemical engineering, metallurgy, thermodynamics, in addition to mechanical engineering. At present, 1 am designing gears, drives and transmissions for helicopters. Helicopters are aircraft that take off and land vertically. Airplanes, also, occasionally do the latter, but helicopters differ in that if their gears and whirlygigs are designed correctly there is a reasonable chance that pilot and passengers will walk away. I have four children of assorted ages and sexes and one wife of the right age, etc. My eldest boy, Peter, Jr., is starting his third year at the University of Virginia. Why not Harvard? He 1s majoring in architectural history. The University of Virginia has the only degree course in this field — and he has a partial scholarship there. The next boy, Jon, is fifteen and a sophomore in high school. Judging from his ability to argue and his deviousness, he may be destined to become a salesman, Philadelphia (West) lawyer, or politician. The eldest girl, Jill, thirteen, is intelligent, pretty, and talented. Who’s prejudiced? She has operatic ambitions and has paid for her own voice lessons by baby sitting since she was a mature eleven-year-cld. The youngest, Jorie, just eleven now, is noted chiefly as cartwheel champion of the greater West—or was until slowed slightly by a broken arm. Her title has been reduced to left-handed cartwheel champion of TGW. The keystone of the house is my wife, Audrey, who strives mightily to keep all of us in order and everything in its place.

I am still an assistant vice-president (they need someone to sign checks!) of a fine book publishing company and still carry responsibility for our social and behavioral science publishing program, though now this has been vastly expanded. As a natural concomitant, this involves me increasingly in administrative problems when my personal inclination is to deal with author and manuscript situations. Put briefly, administration frustrates me. It is gratifyimg to know that certain people must enjoy this activity, else our whole complex civilization would collapse. L enjoy book publishing and would not willingly follow another career. I like the fact that each book is a gamble with all the elements of excitement that gambling provides for so many of us. To bet that one has correctly appraised the significance of a new field, the extent of the potential market and the qualifications of an author to write in that field and then to find that the bet has paid off financially and with honor to the imprint is a deep and abiding thrill. Let’s not talk of the flops— the skeletons that live in every editor’s closet. Another residual benefit is the thought that one has provided the channel by which is made available some addition to the store of human knowledge. May all classmates be similarly placed so that Monday mornings are never dreaded. My family is a source of both delight and despair. Did I not love its members deeply, they would evoke neither sentument. As the children progress, adolescence to adulthood, it is a constant reminder that the years have indeed passed. With a son in the Marines, a girl in college and two girls still at home, Jean and I meet daily the problems of youth in various stages. I’m probably not a terribly good or model parent, though I try my best. Here, as elsewhere, I recognize my frailries and limitations. Yet is it not this that characterizes us as hu ' : : Le man beings and not just infallible cogs in a mechanistic culture? Extensive travel is my lot in connection with my work but, to my regret, only in the United States. I leave the more exotic trips to the rest of you. I have few hobbies beyond reading, though I collect a few stamps, listen to some good music, enjoy a little swimming and sailing and enjoy a good drink (for medicinal purposes! ). I root for the Red Sox and the Harvard teams and am gratified more often by the latter",,GORDON STERLING IERARDI,"Book publishing: assistant vice-president, editor, in charge of","Trustee, National Braille Press, Inc",,Jean Colburn Temple,1935-1939,,

The chronology is as follows. From 1939 to 1941 Before going overseas in September, 1943, | met and married Elaine Rose Lichtenberg (Sarah Lawrence 45), of New York City. At this point, idealistic as 1 was (and still am), I decided to return to my first interest, international affairs (my major at college) and prepare myself for an active role in this area. This required entering the first class of the newly-formed School of International Affairs at Columbia University, where I worked under such authorities as Grayson Kirk, Philip Jessup, and Philip Mosely, specializing in international administration. Upon receiving the degree, Master of International Affairs, in 1948 I was lucky enough to obtain employment at the United Nations, then at Lake Success, first in the Budget and Administration Division and then in the Department of Economic Affairs. In the latter Department, I became the administrative officer in 1949 for the newlyformed Technical Assistance Administration. My job covered the drafting of budgets, the organizing of missions of experts to underdeveloped countries, arranging fellowships, etc. We operated with limited financial resources. Moreover, Soviet intransigence was becoming more and more of a roadblock to United Nations progress, particularly after Korea. Much of my initial idealism was dimmed, although I felt then and still feel that the United Nations is an institution that in the end must succeed",,ROBERT KAPLAN,"Research director, John Shillito Company, department store, Cincinnati Division of Federated Department Stores, Inc","President, 1963-64, former vice-president and treasurer, Cincinnati School Foundation; chairman, Foundation Committee on School Finance, 1959-62, New Frontiers Forum of Hamilton County, 1962-63, 1963-64; member, executive board, Democrats United, 1963-64; Precinct executive, 196264; chairman, Geographic Division, Greater Cincinnati United Fund Campaign, 1964 (previously serving in various chairmanship roles at district and divisional levels}; member, Budget Review Committee, Community Chest of Greater Cincinnati; member of board, since 1957, former vice-president and treasurer, senior vice-president, 1963-64, Temple Sholom; member, board of trustees, Jewish Community Center, 1962-63, 1963-64; member, Committee of 100, Citizens Committee on Youth; chairman, Jewish Committee on Scouting, Dan Beard Council; delegate te Ohio State House Conference on Education, 1958, 1960, member of Organizing Committee, 1958; member, three-man task force to study financing problems of WCET, Cincinnati Educational TV Foundation, 196] (continuing to serve in advisory capacity)",,Elaine Rose Lichtenberg,1935-1939,,

I put in two years at Littauer Center upon graduation, and at the end of this two years, I took Civil Service training at an arsenal in Illinots, married, and with new spouse was sent to the beautiful Finger Lakes region of New York State to help set up offices for the newly-established Seneca Ordnance Depot in Kendaia, New York. This was in the fall of 1941. Setting up the offices was a challenging task for the young group of recent grads to whom the Ordnance Department had assigned this task, but they did a job and formed lasting friendships, even though we are now scattered all over the country — all except me and one or two others who established their homes in this lovely area. I went into the Army, serving with the Ordnance Department, and after OCS and one other assignment I was sent back to Seneca Ordnance and served there until the termination of my Army service. My wife, Pauline, and I had established our home in nearby Geneva, New York, and it has remained our home and the birthplace of our daughters, Marilyn, twenty-one, Nancy, fourteen, and Penny, twelve. We are both actively involved in the affairs of this community and our church. We also have a summer home on Seneca Lake, midway between our home and my place of business, a lumber yard in Ovid, New York. The lake and cottage provide us all with a delightful summer respite, though I remain on the job. I do building and remodeling and this is definitely my “season.” I am serving as president of the local Board of Education and we are grappling with district consolidation, expansion of vocational training facilities, improvement of physical plants, etc. 604 This is a highly organized and stimulating town to live in, owing in large part to the presence of Hobart College and the Cornell adjunct, the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station, The faculties offer the community a fine calibre of scholar and citizen.

During World War Il, I served four years in the Army Medical Corps (as a bacteriologist), two of ee these years in North Africa and Italy. Career-wise, I have enjoyed the dubious satisfaction for the past five years of feeling that all my previous work experience has been cumulative; that each of my earlier activities has enabled me to do a better job at what Iam doing now. My present work is aimed at improving the standards of training received by paramedical personnel, such as laboratory and X-ray technicians, physical and occupational therapists, etc. In recent years I have been involved in projects dealing with the economics of medical care—the effective use of hospital beds — the efficient organization of medical services — all aimed at contribuung to a better understanding (by the public and the professions) of medical care prices and expenditures. Previous to that, I helped develop a policy for more effective working relations between physicians in private practice and public health personnel. Another satisfaction I have gained from my employment in recent years has been the feeling that I was involved in something very much in the “stream of things.” Incidentally, these satisfactions represent a substantial portion of payment in kind. In any case, our small family manages to live modestly as “flowering suburbanites” on Chicago’s North Shore, participates in many community and church-sponsored activities that solid American conformists are expected to take part in, and creates an illusion of enjoying it. In the meantime, my wife wants me to join her in a course she is taking in the new mathematics. She warns that life will pass me by unless I keep up with modern education.

However, this was made much more pleasant by my marriage to my present wife who was kind enough to single-handedly bear us three children.

At this climacteric, if it is one, what floats in my consciousness is a curious subdued mix of guilts and compassions, a sense of not yet being set in any mold, yet with a feeling that this has been a very long prologue, and I really ought to get down to it some time soon. I begin to feel time as a measured weight, I can see now what is left and become more conscious of the cup that shall not pass from me; where the future, save for the chance of being killed in the war, was once immeasurable. It was much to my astonishment that I found myself heading for Europe on a Sheldon in July, 1941, and I have been faintly astonished at the turns I have taken since. I could write another Candide about the way I have consistently walked blithely past, or wrong-headedlv refused the obvious opportunities in those and subsequent years. But I am still no advocate of the stringently planned career; the tests I walked into, painful as many of them have been, give me a certain satisfaction that I have not ducked any tough ones, and that I have been a part, however small, of my times. I know now I can get in and make do in a variety of actions and areas. Still, 1 can report as real achievement only survival, which in this day, as ir any, is, 1 suppose, something. It is an accomplishment too, I suppose, tha: one who helped free a Concentration Camp, who has been on the fringes of administration of one or more churches, and who has seen a reasonably full spectrum of man in business and management, refuses still tc be cynical although he must accept occasional disillusion. I cannot believe in determinism in the face of human freedom, whatever the puerile assumptions of the reams of behavioral science research, some of it issuing, several tens of thousands of tons of U.S. artillery, ammunition and other war material. This was done in pursuance of General Marshall's objective of re-equipping the Communist armies for amalgamation into the Chinese Nationalist forces. The supplies 1 assembled never were peacefully transferred but fell into Communist hands in the subsequent Nationalist loss of Peiping. For my work in this connection, 1 was decorated by both General Wedemeyer and General Chiang Kai-shek",,,,

In my situation, flying can be and is a vocation, a very pleasurable avocation, and a means of fairly extensive travel. Our company, since we really started moving in 1952, has come up from an annual volume of about $3,500,000 to a current volume of about twelve times that, and this has been quite satisfying. Furthermore, it apparently has a long, long way to go, so business activity should continue to be fascinating. We have had some fine experiences in bringing up our children, including a lot of travel with them to Cuba (some years ago), Mexico, Europe and around. We have also had a real tragedy. Our second son, Dan, was a fine outstanding boy. He had been admitted to both Harvard and Princeton at the end of his senior year at high school.

If I had tried to forecast in June, 1939, what life had in store TP would not have even been close. How quickly these twenty-five years have passed. In retrospect, there was continuous adjustment in epuions and objectives. Perhaps this post graduation period can be divided into two 838 parts. The first one of constant change through the Korean War and the second bringing us up to date, First, on graduation from Harvard was two years at Harvard Business School and an M.B.A. degree in industrial management. Then the first full-time job in the purchasing organization at Westinghouse in Pittsburgh. During the war, job and job locations changed rapidly. First in Maryland, then again in Pennsylvania and lastly in Ohio. Trips to Washington to the Controlled Materials Sections of War Production Board became a commuting exercise. The most important event in this time was my marriage to “Edie” McCracken (Wellesley ’41) in February, 1942.

My comments in prior Reports have been confined to supplying the statistics requested. Now as the Twenty-fifth approaches an assaying look about seems to be called for, On the narrative I have continued in the practice of probate law where I started out of law school. The frustrating delay of four years in the service, which ten years ago seemed still a great hurdle, is now far behind. The delays of the law itself are often worse for the young lawyer than for the outraged plaintiff. Wich the passage of time, however, has come steady advance in experience, responsibilities assumed and the inescapably important income. A few years ago, with a view to retirement, a professional trustee who was both friend and client invited me into his business which as it happens operates out of an office across the hall. This work has turned out to be a most satisfactory combination with my probate practice, and I now enjoy a feeling of some reasonable success in my professional pursuits, I note from the Twentieth Report with some relief that many of the Class — at least as of that time — are in the same general position I find myself in — that is, with no great claim to fame but a pleasant and in most ways satisfying and busy life. Our third move in twelve years of marriage brought us out to the country to the larger house my family ee LL AAA ese i - . —_~ seemed to require on an amount of land more than adequate to satisfy my desire for elbow room. Country living turns out to be most pleasant after years of thinking I was really an urbanite at heart. Our four daughters, ages five to ten, demand the usual amount of time, and this ogether with working around the place keeps me occupied and provides he exercise needed in the inevitable battle of the bulge. Activities in qe town government and church affairs tax what little time is left. We ok longingly at the barn and fields, but discretion indicates that horses -d other animals can wait until the girls can supply most of the “man wer.” It is a bit unnerving to note that classmates have children }duating from college, and indeed some are grandfathers, while my est is but ten. This result of late marriage may nonetheless serve to p me young — or kill me with concern and impatience, particularly move toward the era of four teen-age daughters.

This program culminated in a week during which I did not see my infant twins at all, they waking after I left home and bedding down before I returned. An attack of introspection resulted, and on recovery with mixed regret and relief I left the satisfactions and harassments of practice to became a full-time medical director with the Prudential Insurance Company of America.

I was early introduced to research by my tutors in biochemistry at Harvard, J. P. Greenstein and D. B. Dill, and M. D, Altschule at Harvard Medical School provided the impetus to continue. By the time I graduated, I shared authorship of several publications and, confusing technical assistance for collaboration, I thought I] could “do” research. In those days medical research was done largely by men in internal medicine, pathology, or the “basic” sciences, and I selected the latter two as possibilities, Accordingly, I split a post-graduate year between pathology at the Massachusetts General Hospital and medicine at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, before these activities were interrupted by World War IL. In Gourock, Scotland, I shared in the consequences of D-Day by tending an Army Hospital ward full of youths, all lacking in complete sets of limbs, Later, in Manchester (Davyhulme) England, the Tenth Station Hospital began to admit large numbers of pregnant military personnel, As laboratory officer, called upon to confirm by laboratory test the obvious fact, I achieved local recognition by rounding up quantities of virgin rabbits and improvising housing facilities —the need for which quartermaster planning for the invasion had failed to anticipate",Francesca Smiler,1935-1939,,

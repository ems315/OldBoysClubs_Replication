To begin at Commencement — the dozen of us taking a Wanderjabr in Alaska dwindled to Walter Jenkins and me in Mexico for two weeks. I settled down in Gloucester but then jumped up again for four years in the Navy. Never lost a ship. Then Frank White, ’39, lured me out West to Ohio to help sail his boat and fill in at something called powder metallurgy. He wouldn’t take girls as regular crew, so Ginny and I bought a lovely old farmhouse to restore. We lived in it, too. After the powder was all filled in I went over to Goodyear Aircraft to help plan a plant to build aeroplanes and dirigible balloons during the next war (really!). We started three children, 2000 pine trees and a boat, then unloaded the life-work (the Restoration, that is) onto another romantic couple and moved here — into a lovely Tudor (“older”) house in a hell of an expensive school district. We are still here, with 4.9 children, which shows I can hold a job for ten years, and you're only as old as you feel — or not even that, sometimes. I must say, though, in spite of Mr. G. Williams’ cartoon, that I am surprised that you are holding the 25th so soon",,,Virginia Hatch,"Metals Disintegrating Corp., Box 290, Elizabeth, N.J.",1936-1940,GSZN-CZG,0.98232526

Here I have indulged my twin hobbies of the orchids of the world and primitive art. Tam retained as consultant by the De Beers Diamond Syndicate which gives me round the w orld trips two to three times a vear; as a result [ have amassed a collection, and grow in my greenhouse, approximately 5000 different species of orchids as well as innumerable hybrids. This is probably the largest collection of species orchids grown in the world. I vacation in Mexico each Christmas and have accumulated one of the two or three major collections of Pre-Columbian Art in America. Middle American archeology and the orchids of the world thus are my major interests, other than research on physics and chemistry of the earth. Last year I made three tips to New Guinea and brought back thirty four tons of carvings, masks, bark paintings and war shields from the Sepic River district in New Guinea as well as a very large col lection of the high mountain orchids of New Guinea.

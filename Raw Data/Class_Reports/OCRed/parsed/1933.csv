Our daughter, Clara, is now in the Choral Society and our son Michael hopes to enter Harvard next fall—he is already a devotee of the A Capella Singers. Sally, Christopher and Barbara sing their parts too. For a dozen years after graduation, I taught French and History at Choate and undertook the multifarious jobs any willing boarding school teacher is likely to try—helping the editors of the school paper and the officers of the Current History Club, harvesting corn and apples with a boys’ work crew, coaching younger teams in hockey and six-man football. In the fall of 1941, I went to Chicago to study American History and our family (two children then) lived at Hull House. We decided to give some years to settlement work, but Pearl Harbor and the great war-time load on friends and family at Choate led me to return to the Choate faculty for the following five years. During that time I got deeply into administration working on admissions, letters and reports to parents, and student counselling. Choate is a great school, with a live faculty, and we never quite stop missing it. of University Women. These are simply two examples of Fisk’s progress “into the main stream” of American life. After a valuable year at the Harvard School of Education (a busman’s holiday type of sabbatical!), I became headmaster of Moses Brown School in Providence. The rewards of working with a most capable group of boys, some skillful and dedicated teachers, and a distinguished group of parents were great. Our association with the Providence Friends Meeting meant a lot to us. occuPaTION: Economist; senior staff member, Brookings Institution, a nonprofit research organization",Nancy Hoyt,1929-1933,,

OFFICES HELD: Secretary to Boston District Manager, 1942-47, salesman, Framingham, Mass., 1947-50, Boston, 1950-53, Armour & Company. MEMBER OF: Knights of Columbus, Keene, N.H. PARENTS: Russell Vaughan AFTER four years of tossing about on the sea of life, I finally landed in a steady job with Armour & Company in Boston, in June, 1938. I tried to be a career man with Armour, working up through the district office to be secretary to the district manager during the war years. After the war I entered the sales field with Armour, moving to Framingham. In 1950 the Framingham branch was closed and I 904 ] was moved back to Boston and was salesman in the BelmontWaltham-Newton area for some time. In 1953, changing conditions in the packinghouse business (brought about by the growth of large chain supermarkets and the shrinking number of independent grocers) forced me to make an “agonizing reappraisal” of the situation. Although I had been a devoted employee of Armour & Company for fifteen years, I decided to leave and try my luck elsewhere. We had purchased a house in Hillsboro, New Hampshire, in 1949 and had spent summers there. In September, 1953, we moved here permanently and began a venture, suggested by my wife, and expanded through my years of experience in calling on stores. We manufacture a completely hand-made doughnut, package and label it and distribute to stores throughout this area, covering Keene, Jaffrey, Greenfield, New Ipswich and New Boston. It may not sound impressive, but we are proud of our product and the demand for it. Our sales run close to $11,000 per year, and that is a lot of production for just two people. We have five children. Four are in school. Our oldest, Virginia, aged seventeen, graduated from high school this year. She is currently working at Sears in Concord, New Hampshire. My chief hobby is trying to make my income equal my outgo. I was not involved in the war, due to the highest draft number I could draw and some exemptions. In looking back to Harvard days, I believe that I could have benefited from some personal guidance. Many of my early difhculties resulted from a paralyzing fear of meeting and talking with strangers. This was a heartbreaking handicap back in the depression years. It took me twelve years to meet and solve this problem. I hope that today’s guidance programs are helping young men and women whose progress is hampered by personality problems. go5 YEARS IN COLLEGE: 1931-1934. DEGREES: S.B., Cun laude, 1934; M.D., 1938. MARRIED: Marjorie Frances Chick, Sept. 22, 1940, North Berwick, Maine. CHILDREN: Sedgwick, Jr., Jan. 18, 1943; Marshall, Oct. 30, 1946. OCCUPATION: Physician, psychiatrist, medical director, Rehabilitation Center; consultant in neurology, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals; consultant, Letterman and Brooke Army Hospitals and Crippled Children Services, State of California. OFFICES HELD: Director, Division of Physical Medicine, assistant professor, associate professor, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Mo., December, 1947, to June, 1954; Lieutenant colonel, Medical Corps, US. Army Reserve. MEMBER OF: American Medical Association; American Association for Advancement of Science; New York Academy of Sciences; American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation; American Academy for Cerebral Palsy; American Academy of Neurology (associate); Association of Military Surgeons; Gerontological Society, Inc. pusLicaTions: More than thirty-five scientific articles and book chapters in the medical literature; chiefly on physiology, neurology, physical medicine and rehabilitation. ONE might almost say that I never went to Harvard. I was inadequately prepared by high school experience and one year at the University of Arizona, and by the lack of a family tradition of higher education. A combination of shyness and stubborn pride kept me away from social contacts with my peers. Although correctly advised not to concentrate too much in scientific subjects, I skimped on the humanities in my passion to be thoroughly prepared for medicine. I had not the courage to take some advanced courses from personages like Kittredge and Whitehead; I declined the privilege of hearing Copey read; I barely scraped acquaintance with Dean Briggs of the rusty umbrella, L. J. Henderson was a vivid disappointment, but then I should record the pleasure of hearing G. H. Parker, G. H. Edgell and André Morize. I got more of the values that the University represents from places like Symphony Hall and the Museum of Fine Arts than from the College. Some of the blame belongs with my tutors and advisers, none of whom made much of a real effort to find out what I lacked, but most of it belongs to me. : BORN: July 10, 1912, Newton Center, Mass.",Frederic Gershon Melcher,,"West Main Street, Hillsboro, N.H.",Marguerite Fellows,OWEN FRANKLIN MATTHEWS,Home baking wholesaler,"Secretary to Boston District Manager, 1942-47, salesman, Framingham, Mass., 1947-50, Boston, 1950-53, Armour & Company",Ethel M.

AT times during the past twenty-five years I have been somewhat of a rolling stone, but for the past twelve I have been living on the North Shore of the Bay State, with my wife, three children, two dogs and several waterfowl. After graduation I thought a slight trip to some of the islands in the Pacific with a few friends would be broadening before settling down and trying to earn a living. This was most pleasant but hardly added to my desirability as far as prospective employers were concerned at a time when jobs were all but non-existent. I found that an A.B. degree was almost a drug on the market but was lucky enough to obtain employment just outside of the city of Philadelphia. Until the war I worked for a couple of other patient employers and also acquired a Philadelphia wife. Shortly before Pearl Harbor the Navy requested me to become an active member of that organization and later on afforded me the opportunity to travel in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Most of 933 ] the time I was in destroyer escorts with other reserves equally inexperienced, but somehow we were able to operate with a reasonable amount of efficiency. After this interlude of four and a half years my New England blood urged me to return to Massachusetts in spite of the fact that the Democrats appear to be trying to discourage this type of maneuver. I am now engaged in the trust end of the banking business, concentrating in pensions and deferred profit-sharing, and find it an extremely interesting occupation.

This was a major turning point in my life, as it marked the beginning of the hardest four years of studying I have ever done, as well as the start of a career that I have followed ever since. From 1933 to 1942, I was involved in what one might roughly describe as “the apprentice years” of my medical life. Included in these are the four spent at New Haven, followed in rapid succession by the ones spent in further postgraduate medical training: Boston City Hospital (1937-38), Massachusetts General Hospital (193839), Strong Memorial Hospital, Rochester, N.Y. (1939-40), and Beverly (Mass.) Hospital, 1940-41. In 1941, four operations on my left forearm for a serious fracture sustained while skiing the previous winter threatened to interfere with my medical training; the last two operations by Dr. Clay Ray Murray at the Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York City were successful and happily enabled me to regain the use of the arm. In October of that year, in spite of the wearing of a cast on my arm, I became engaged. Pearl Harbor came while I was convalescing in the hospital from the fourth operation. I was married on December roth and a honeymoon trip to Arizona and California lasted through January, 1942. From February, 1942, to the middle of the summer, I was temporarily associated with a medical group in Waterville, Maine; this pleasant life for my wife and me ended in August, when along with so many others, I was called into the Army as a medical officer. After only a few months at Fort Devens, trying to understand the curious ways of army life, I found myself with other army officers, nurses and enlisted personnel on a small transport (a converted",Elizabeth Kusberer,1930-1933,L1CK-TYT,0.99882334

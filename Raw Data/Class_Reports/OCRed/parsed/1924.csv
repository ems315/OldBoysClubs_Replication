IT WOULD be contrary to Oriental modesty and rather presumptuous of me to think that my life history during the past quarter of a century could be anything but a matter of personal interest. To avoid any possible misunderstanding, I hasten to explain that I can only refer, not to wealth, but to dearth of achievements. It is worth writing only because it shows a pattern of life peculiar to that “privileged” class of people known in China as “the returned students.” It is marked by interruptions, frustrations, and disappointments. Balked by almost insurmountable obstacles, tossed between high hopes and low accomplishments, one has been like flotsam in the wide sea of Chinese politics, 148 ] 25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT Immediately after graduation from Harvard, I went to England and entered Pembroke College, Oxford, to do post-graduate work in modern history. I found myself very much at home in this ancient seat of learning. There, the time-worn, ivy-covered buildings, the quiet leisurely manner of life, the ceremonious conduct of the people, their earnestness in the pursuit of learning — these and other aspects impressed most favorably my Oriental mind. There and then I made a secret vow that some day I would build another Oxford in China, just as I thought that I would emulate the example of President Eliot. I had a most enjoyable time during my three terms at Oxford. There was no compulsory class-work, I was free to read what leased me, and I read voraciously. I learned to smoke a pipe before the large open fireplace at the Oxford Union. I was a regular visitor to the numerous bookshops, and every evening I carried armfuls of books to my “digs.” These lucky finds formed the nucleus of my present collection of Western books, and in those days they afforded me happiness and contentment. During the long vacations I travelled extensively on the Continent and visited the principal cities of interest. Indeed, I thought then that I would like to remain indefinitely at Oxford. Everything seemed so congenial and pleasant that I became quite oblivious of the fact that I was a student and a foreigner. Then came the shocking news from Shanghai about the May 3oth Incident in which a number of Chinese students were shot to death by order of some English municipal officers. This shooting affair brought about a nationwide boycott against everything British, and caused me to return to China. When ina reminiscent mood, and in view of so many unhappy “incidents” which occurred after that date, I have often reproached myself for yielding to the impulse of patriotism, thereby cutting short my stay at Oxford. J returned by the overland route, visiting those European countries which I had not covered in my previous itineraries. During this trip I had as travelling companions two Chinese officials who were on an investigation mission, and they gave me many facilities and opportunities which I could not have had if I had travelled alone. The three weeks in Moscow were memorable in that I had the opportunity to see many of the results 149 ]",Clara Tsao,1922-1924,,

For several summers and for one fourteen-month stretch on an Austin Fellowship, I studied what I needed and things I wanted. Do you remember that in the catalogue there were courses you wanted to take just for the fun or the joy of it, but the crowded schedule and the concentration requirements wouldn’t permit it? Well, here was the chance for me to take some of those courses, and my wife took a few others. So, by 1934 I had both feet in teaching, with a schedule involving secondary school teaching and supervision, and some university teaching. One unique joy of my work was to organize the Trans-Lake Study Groups—the only regular and continuous student exchange between Canada and the United States. That seems to have paid off, for the students, I hope for the two countries, and for me in my new friends in the Great Dominion. In 1930 I had the chance to start exercising, if not practising, the other original interest of designing and constructing buildings and other gadgets for living. We bought thirty-six acres of white pine and meadow in the Bristol Hills, Finger Lakes country. Now we have a small house of a modified Frank Lloyd Wright style, a concrete swimming pool, a “scientific” garden, and several other buildings and outdoor living arrangements. On these I experimented with functional design, unique space arrangements, and devices to promote ease of living. And I sull have more ideas and more excuses to try them out. But best of all it is ours —the result of our own design and physical work. And so, I lead a double life, and I recommend it. In general, for five days a week, forty weeks a year, I am caught up in the excitement, interests, and rush of a professional life — teaching in two institutions, planning courses of study, working on committees, conducting adult forums, taking my turn as officer in professional and civic bodies, and filling speaking engagements. The rest of the 365 days a year I work with my hands or sit at my drawing board, in the quiet of the hills. Or my wife and I just relax — the two of us or with friends — or we re-explore the beautiful countryside by motor and on foot. I happened to miss the two world wars. I was just a little too young for the first one, Early in the second one I was rushing 313 ]",Geraldine Barbour,1921-1924,,

AS A veteran of the first World War, I entered Harvard with the idea of completing an interrupted education. For many reasons I found it difficult to adapt myself to school life. As a result, I became acquainted with very few members of the Class. I could not participate in freshman football as I had played with the Dartmouth freshman team in the fall of 1919. My only activity was as a member of the Harvard Second Varsity in the fall of 1921. Later, on State Street, and in politics, I met many members of our Class. In the first World War, I lost my only brother, Lieutenant Ernest Armand Giroux (Dartmouth, ’19), a member of the 103rd Pursuit Squadron, United States Army Air Service. Those interested can easily imagine my feelings when I encountered my son, Lieutenant Ernest Armand Giroux, 2d, ’44, at various times in this recent war — first in Manchester, England; then Normandy in July, 1944; later Paris, where we visited his birthplace at Sevres-Ville d’Avray; finally, serving together in the unit I commanded in Hof, northeast Bavaria. My political conviction is that the Republican party must take its leadership from men of broad understanding such as Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., of the Class of 1924. I believe that life is well worth living and that great progress has been made in our time. Even greater progress is ahead. + EUGENE CHELLIS GLOVER MarRRIED: Dorothy E. Colby, Dec. 26, 1931",Julia G.

IT’S getting to be a long story from the early peaceful days in Budapest, through Hitler’s rise to power in Berlin, the State Department’s “Spanish desk” during the civil war, the Anschluss, the first years of the Franco régime, political unrest in Colombia, a political desk in the State Department again with interests ranging from Iceland to Indonesia, and finally to postwar Paris. What comes next is unpredictable but my desire finally to settle permanently in the United States becomes increasingly strong as the years go by. Just where to do so is a question, however. I would once unhesitatingly have said “somewhere in New England” but in my declining years the Massachusetts climate as I remember it seems a little rugged. *- JOHNSON EDWARD EVERETT MORRIS BorRN: April 1, 1903, Columbia, S.

I AM very glad to have graduated twenty-five years ago. Presentday standards seem so much higher that it is highly questionable whether I could do it today — particularly from Harvard — but I suppose that is only what time does to you. After a trip abroad. with my brother, Thaddeus, during the summer of 1924, I came back to the Business School in an attempt to get additional education for I knew not what career. I spent two years there until I felt so stale that I could not crack another book or take another exam, then went into the securities business in Boston with the First Boston Corporation. Then I met the girl and we were married and lived happily ever after. But to go back — we were married in the fall of 1930 and I then went to work in New York for the same firm. Then in the next eleven years came the children, Richard in 1931, Orient in 1934, Louisa in 1936, Gertrude in 1939, and Katherine in 1941, Richie while we lived in Tarrytown, New York, and the others after we had bought a little old farmhouse in Lewisboro, New York, in 1934. It was the kind of place we had always wanted —on a hill with a view of the Sound, the last house at the end of a dirt road. We were almost six miles from the New Canaan railroad station, but the rigors of the commute were as nothing when at the end of it I had a wonderful family in a charming house in the dead silence of real country. Mabel and I look back on those thirteen years now as a perfect period in our lives. But it probably was a mistake to have stayed as long as we did.

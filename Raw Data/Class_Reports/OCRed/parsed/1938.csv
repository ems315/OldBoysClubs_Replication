However, I point out to young journalistic hopefuls that while it’s dandy to have a practically virgin desk by late afternoon, it’s also wise to develop fancy footwork to keep those creditors at least at a finger’s length. But it’s often been fun and what the after-dinner speakers refer to as stimulating. And I must admit I thrive on deadlines nearly as well as on martinis, 97] With the exception of several years in the Air Force in World War II editing papers and writing speeches and handouts for higher brass, my other chief occupation and interest has been my family, My wife continues to amaze me and now, with son Tom a senior at Western Michigan University and daughter Blakeslee a sophomore at the College of New Rochelle and our other three well along in school, has taken to elementary education. She is having a ball teaching unsuspecting fifth-graders and also is getting a Master’s at Michigan State. I find a new exposure to teaching and educational theories — especially testing — most intriguing and am thoroughly convinced there’s a much sharper group of small fry on the way up than was the case thirty years ago. Fortunately my eldest daughter takes after her mother and was a National Merit scholar. I’m hoping it rubs off on the last three. I'm also hoping my second son, John, may get a crack at Harvard although I understand it’s considerably easier to invade the inner vaults at Fort Knox. In leisure moments I’ve found good sport in amateur movie making (some horrible, a few good and the others fair), scale model railroading and, for a few years, running a summer baseball team",Ellen Blakeslee McNabb,1934-1938,,

AS a fairly regular attendant of Harvard Commencements over the years since 1938 I used to marvel how young the Twenty >-fiveyear Class seemed and how wonderfully preserved the Fifty- rear contingent was. But now the prospect of marching with the first of these favored milestone groups only leads me to question the reliability of my former observations, or at the least to entertain new hypotheses about the true relationship of appearance and reality. The altered impression is due neither to improved vision nor to a more favorable perspective but rather, I suspect, to a pressure drop in the fountain of youth. It is now ten years since I began learning how to adjust myself to a pace less intense and less time-absorbing than that of the preceding dozen years devoted primarily to ‘administrative involvements in varying challenging assignments in the field of higher education. But even challenges, I learned, are resolved by the application of routines and the iron law of organization is inevitably a retreat to bureaucracy. Teaching and research on a full-time basis seemed a welcome escape from the twenty-four-hour world of wind-mill tilting, which the combatants — hoping either to deceive themselves or others — prefer to describe as leadership",Jessie Cohen,1934-1938,,

IN approaching this report for the 25th, little seemed to have occurred to me, Anne and the children since the 18th Anniversary Report. But to set the tone and provide a smooth sequence, I dusted off the 1956 Report. It was, therefore, a shock to find that within the last seven years we had lived in five additional locations. In 1956 we were in Westmount, Quebec, where I was assistant general manager of the Dewey and Almy Division of W. R. Grace of Canada. In 1957 we had our fill of city living in the English enclave in Montreal and moved out to the delightful town of Hudson Heights located thirty miles northwest of Montreal on the Lake of Two Mountains. Our stay in this idyllic spot was not only punctuated by three trips to South America sans famille but came to a quick end with my assignment as Eastern Division general manager of the CRYOVAC Division of Grace. This involved moving the whole gang from Canada to Greenville, South Carolina, In late 1960, hav 125] ing finally received my voting certificate and having built a new house in the Green Valley section of Greenville, I was made general sales manager for CRYOVAC with headquarters in Cambridge",,JOHN BIDWELL,"Vice-president, marketing","President, New England Chapter, American Marketing Association; vice president, Montreal Chapter, American Marketing Association; vice-president, Business Association Club, president, Harvard Club of Western South Carolina",,Anne L.

AT a recent meeting of my Naval Reserve training class, the instructor asked how many of the twenty-five members of the class (average age overy forty) were still doing what their colleges had trained them to do. One hand went up. He then asked how many were completely satisfied with their present work. Again, one hand —a different one. Neither, unfortunately, mine . . . as an undergraduate I studied English, hoping someday to become a writer. I sull entertain that hope, but the actuality (with the exception of a considerable spate of technical writing) has gone glimmering until some nebulous time when current pressures will be sufficiently relaxed to permit an attempt at uneconomic creativity. Having apologized in this roundabout fashion for your library’s lack of volumes bearing my name, I shall scan the last quarter century for a possible explanation. At first I tried banking, at the State Street Trust Company, but for me the counting houses held little appeal. Applications filed 128 ] with many a newspaper and publishing house met with no success; classmates will recall that jobs were still scarce in 1938. Eventually, after a temporary stint in merchandising, I joined McNally & Stuck len (a Beacon Hill real estate office). I walked prospective cus tomers up and down the Hill, and lived an exuberant bachelor life unul the sobering jolt of Pearl Harbor. In our Tenth Report I described the next four years in some detail. Summarized, I was trained at the Navy Photographic Interpretation School, spent a year in the South Pacific, returned for a short tour in Norfolk, and decided to get married while Dottie was still available and interested ... time has proved this my best decision since graduation. Only four months later I sailed with an amphibious transport squadron, and spent the rest of the war planning for, and taking part in, such wellknown invasions as Saipan, Leyte and Lingayen Gulfs, and Okinawa ... also some less well known such as Zambales and Tinian. At a Philippine port called San Fernando I shared several wet evenings with a young lieutenant (j.g.) Sloan Wilson (later associated with the Gray Flannel Suit). We talked a lot about writing, but . . . and here comes my limping explanation . . . he not only talked about it, but even then was steadily doing it when not actively commanding his small tanker. I still talk about writing and he still does it. My work after the war ranged from industrial appraisal sales to radio announcing. In 1949 a golden voice was lost to the airways when I joined the government as a photo interpreter in the Navy Department. The Korean War broke out and I was returned to active duty as a lieutenant commander. I served on the major staffs at Hawaii and Japan, with side trips to Korea.

I moved to New York City in 1944 and have made my office there ever since. In 1955 I became a vice-president and director of Amerotron, the textile division of Textron, Inc., and two years later was appointed executive vicepresident of this division, With the tremendous changes that have taken place in our industry during this period, my work and travel have been both varied and stimulating and I have enjoyed every minute of it",,RONALD ROADMAN BOYD,"Executive vice-president, Amerotron Company, Division of Textron, Inc","Vice-president, director, executive committee member, National Association of Wool Manufacturers, since 1959; director and executive committee member, Woolens & Worsteds of America, since 1960; chairman, Advisory Technical Consultant Group to Economic Policy Committee, American Textile Manufacturers Institute, 1962-63; vice-president and director, Perkins Road Association, Greenwich, Conn,, since 1960; treasurer, Couples Club, Second Congregational Church, Greenwich, Conn. 1962-63",,Alyce Byron,1934-1938,,

MY LIFE since leaving Cambridge has undoubtedly been more provincial and stereotyped than that of many of my classmates. 1 am still living in Winchester, Massachusetts, and have been conunuously in the same business. Nevertheless this span of time has had its rewards and I am thankful for the good share of well-being that has been accorded me. On graduation I became associated with the investment firm of Kidder, Peabody & Company. This was a field that I] thought would be a profitable and satisfying one. The first years certainly were not characterized by the former and early in 1o4t I became associated with one of the predecessors of my present firm. In this early period I thought I had all the answers to things financial, a conception that time obliterated. However, I am still as fascinated as ever with the world of securities. Since 1952 I have been a general partner in the firm of Hemphill, Noyes & Company, where practically all the other partners are graduates of either Cornell, Princeton or Yale.

AS an undergraduate, I may be remembered for my preoccupation with the problem of preventing World War II. I report for the record that I failed. In the summer of 1938, I spent several weeks in Austria with the Quakers in their work with the Jews trapped by the Anschluss with Germany. During the next two years, I held down a job with a Boston investment counselling firm. The “sitzkrieg” was getting ready to blitz, and I worked with the neutrality committees. Before the bombs had dropped on Pearl Harbor, War III; but to share the burden of this modest assignment, I now had a lovely and understanding lifelong companion.

A TWENTY-FIVE-YEAR report has a way of making us stop and take stock. It has been a turbulent period i in the history of this world of ours and, in a way, in the lives of all of us. In this short span, we have passed from a world of relative stability into a world where uncertainty is the rule of the day. We are passing through a period of massive change in scientific know ledge, inventive ingenuity, social upheaval, and sociological conscience. In the above framework, we are proud to know that many of our classmates are in the forefront. How, therefore, can one objectively equate twenty-five years spent in keeping the human side as a main objective? After a year at the Harvard Business School, I have been putting into practice the balance between the psychology of human beings and the demands of the business world. After six years in the Air Force, the after effects were very clear, and, like so many others, I fele the need to get the taste out of my mouth.

Although the objective of searching for new oil and gas reserves may have been clouded as an employee of a big company, it became crystal clear when, in 1947, an independent career was launched and survival was put on the stake. Since that time there has been very little security (actually none) but lots of independence and personal satisfaction in achievement. As time passed the family quickly adjusted to chicken on Sunday and feathers on Monday and fortunately never learned to assume that prosperity was eternal, since it was all related somehow to dry hole ratios, foreign oil imports, well allowables, luck and the whims of some liberal-minded politicians from Harvard.

I find that my recollections of the days of World War II following graduation have dimmed considerably, especially since my service was non-combatant. These years now seem important to me for two events — the beginning of a happy marriage which will be twenty years along at Reunion time, and the three years correspondent, assistant sales manager and, from 1956 to 1959, ficld sales manager. During these years I supervised a sales force of twenty manufacturers’ representatives and traveled extensively in thirty-six of our then forty-eight states, calling on all the leading hardware wholesalers and contract builders’ hardware distributors. My favorite stops were Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas and Atlanta, but I enjoyed many other cities also. At times I felt as if 1 should write my own version of Inside U.S.A. In 1960 the opportunity came to relocate in southern California with this same employer, as a sales representative. So, in January, 1960, we joined the great twentieth-century migration to the land of freeways and smog. We had experienced “‘Monotonously bad weather in Ohio — we now decided we would try monotonously good weather in California. We selected Orange County as the best all-around location, and the city of Garden Grove as our specific home. It was quite an abrupt change from a small city of 10.000 to the second largest metropolitan area in our country, but also an exciting change. Orange Country is full of transplanted middlewesterners and easterners. As native Bostonians, we found it easy to resume life in a large city again. We bought a home immediately, made friends with our neighbors, joined the local Methodist Church the first month, and in six months’ time felt like native Californians",,HERBERT WILSON CRISPIN,"Sales representative, Shelby Corporation",,"“The Transcendental Railroad,” New England Quarterly, 1951; “Walt Whitman and the Locomotive,” American Quarterly, 1954; “Howells Turns to the Inner Life,” New England Quarterly, 1957; “Some Varieties of Inspiration,” Aspects of American Poetry",Muriel Louise Lindahl,1934-1938,,

IT’S tough enough trying to be what Lucie calls a “good father” to our three boys without having to find additional evening time to write this account. (Writing is still hard going for this Math major, now attorney, and I know no way of doing this piece quickly.) That first paragraph was designed to conjure up a very accurate picture of a brief case at home too often. And it’s not that the daytime hours are idly spent, it’s a case of involvement in what I fortunately enough find to be personally satisfying legal work. 344 ] Pll return to the legal work, but first I must record the even greater satisfaction of being one of our family, of “doing things” with Lucie and the boys, both at home and on trips. Lucie and I have had our vacations alone, but more often all three boys are very much with us. So far our family vacations have been spent on the seashore or at Lake Placid. The western trip, motel style, comes in ’64 or 65. My greatest claim to success as a father came in my taking all three boys, then aged four, six, and eight, to Washington, D.C., without their mother, and, most unusual these days, on an overnight train ride. It was then I discovered how much fun it could be to show them the Capitol and to give them the chance to climb up and down the upper bunk ladder in the B&O bedroom. My civic activities have centered on the Cleveland Welfare Federation Agencies and Committees. A Harvard friend started me in the Family Service Association of Cleveland in 1951 as a Board member.

TO go back to 1938, my first great surprise after graduation was the basic difference between the study of law (first year courses especially) at the Harvard Law School and the study of things in general, with some emphasis on American government, economics, history and literature, a course in Greek, all a continuum of fun without any serious break during my years at Roxbury Latin School and at Harvard College. The Law School approach was so different (except in Professor Sheldon Glueck’s course in criminal law), and although I learned to love Professors Seavey, Scott, Morgan, Williston, Griswold, Hart, Hall and all the rest at the Harvard Law School, there was never at first the excitement such as I had experienced in George Northrop’s class on Milton at Roxbury Latin School, James Buell Munn on Elizabethan poetry, Mason Hammond in Greek B, 374] reading Plato’s dialogues, C.

I REMEMBER as a child how my father, an Episcopal clergyman, used to deplore his lack of sanctions to enforce a terrific drive to do good. His frustrations prompted my becoming a Harvard lawyer, the profession of statesmen, so that I would not lack the power. Fortunately, experiences during World War II years taught me the lesson required of our age: Caesar has the power but can do no good; good comes only through God who uses no compulsions and needs no man’s help. But I had prepared to be a politician, not an evangelist. And there have been no votes anywhere today to be obtained from a platform grounded on the principle that 624 ] government can do no good, that its only proper function is negative: to do as little as possible and then only what is absolutely necessary. So we have spent the weeks cultivating our garden — Anne now at home with the baby and I at the office overlooking Independence Hall.

I married Marynoyes Kellogg in June, 1941. During the rest of Medical School and through internship, Marynoyes worked as a chemist in the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. After internship at this hospital we went off on a military tour to Abilene and San Antonio, Texas, and Springfield, Missouri. At this stage, Marynoyes went home and I went overseas to France, Germany and Austria, courtesy of the 71st Infantry Division. Shortly after returning home in May, 1946, I returned to post-graduate training at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital and Pratt Diagnostic Hospital, finally beginning the private practice of medicine at the age of thirty-one years. Since then there has been a great demand on time by the practice. As Osler said, “Medicine is a jealous mistress.” Marynoyes has been very much occupied with the care of our five children",Marynoyes Kellogg,1934-1938,,

MY life since 1938 has evolved unspectacularly. I left college with no clear career plans. A year in a business job back home in Chicago provided decompression from the rarefied atmosphere of undergraduate Cambridge. By its end I had decided on a life of scholarship. The long road to the Ph.D. was further extended by four years of unmartial duty in the Navy. A fledgling historian, I taught for three years at a girls’ college in California, then took a job with the Dictionary of American. Biography and found myself a historical editor. When Supplement Two of the DAB wound up (at Columbia), I was called back to Cambridge to edit a sort of distaff DAB sponsored by Radcliffe: Notable American Women, 1607-1950. This work — still in process — will in due course issue from the Harvard University Press in three volumes comprising some 1500 sketches of women from Pocahontas to Edith Wharten and Jean Harlow. Conceived as a contribution to scholarship as well as a useful reference work, Notable American Wonren will, 713] it is hoped, stimulate interest in a neglected aspect of American social history. My wife, a fellow scholar since we met in the Graduate School, is my chief editorial associate. When this project finishes, a couple of years hence, I am booked to go back to the DAB as editor.

I WAS about to start this narrative with the statement: “After four and one-half uneventful war years served in small vessels of 785 ] the U.S. Navy .. .”, when just in time I remembered the biggest, best and happiest event of my career to date — my marriage, June 5, 1942. That great event could easily take up ten times the entire space allotted on this form, Let it suffice to state that never has any man to my knowledge had to overcome so many obstacles in so short a space of time to win the hand of a maiden. I doubt if I could now persuade a highly uncooperative commanding officer, who did not think too much of marriage as an institution anyway, that I had to have at least three days to get married. I wonder if I now would have the drive and perseverance to straighten out in one day the perfect morass of red tape occasioned by tests, waiting eriod, etc., that were required for a New York marriage license, and I still look back with amazement on the fact that I was able to persuade a taxi driver to drive me from Norfolk to Washington on credit, when on the morning of the big day all the planes were grounded because of fog. It was then I acquired my first gray hair, but it’s been well worth it. So let’s begin again. After four and one-half uneventful war years (except for the above very important event), I returned to my home town, New York City, and commenced the long, arduous apprenticeship of the young lawyer. Now some sixteen years later, I cannot detect any great difference between what I did then and what I do now, except that the probate clerk at the New York County Surtogate’s Court sometimes calls me by name instead of calling me sonny — recognition of some sort",,"HENRY MAYNARD KIDDER, JR.","Lawyer, partner, Meyer, Kissel, Matz & Seward",,,Reine M.

One year of banking in New York convinced me that this would be fine — for others. Plans changed and I entered the University of Virginia Law School in 1940. (I later felt fortunate that I had decided earlier not to join a cavalry regiment in New York City —to get my year of military service over with — because the regiment became converted to an armored tank unit two months later!) The new three-year plan embraced conscientious study of law, to become an ace New York lawyer with a large income! My good fortune was that I met Heatie (Evelyn to her home folks) within three weeks after my arrival in Charlottesville, Virginia — and while this changed my plans, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. For the first time it seemed that I began to place real value on things other than money (or the lack of it in my case) and my world took on a completely different aspect. (My sister sensed the change sooner than I and stated with some relief that I had finally come to see the forest through the trees.) My draft board couldn’t quite see me spending three pleasant, consecutive years in the Virginia foot-hills —and so I joined the Navy in the spring of 1942. It seemed like an awfully long three and a half years— first with Naval Intelligence in Washington, then as an ensign on the destroyer Caperton in the Pacific, and finally as a lieutenant on the carrier Lake Champlain in the Atlantic",,FREDERICK A.

I WRITE this in the midst of the Cuban crisis. My mind goes back to 1936 when Hitler remilitarized the Rhineland. If France and England had stood firm and prevented that expansion of German power, twenty million people might not have perished in violent conflict in the following ten years, Few of us were much aware of the significance of that event in our sophomore year. I think first of our classmates and comrades who lost their lives in the vast conflagration that followed our graduation, and then of others who have died prematurely in recent years. There are many men bones from family tradition that I could not approach her with the freshness and enthusiasm of a stranger to her halls of learning. Perhaps it was because the prevailing scepticism in matters of faith and morals robbed her of appeal to me. No doubt, also, I did not give Harvard of my best, so she could not give her best to me. Intellectual honesty and carefulness in search and scholarship she taught me, but not vision and hope and great expectation. Yet “where there is no vision the people perish.” Let us hope she may regain that vision which inspired her founders and impart it generously to her sons, | think already she has begun to do so under the presidency of Nathan Pusey",Jean McDowell Hanger,1934-1938,,

IN June of 1938, I watched all the old men of the Twenty-fifth Re union Class march into the Stadium and I still clearly remember my surprise that so many of that ancient class had the strength to come back to Harvard. Now, returning for my own Twenty-fifth, I just don’t feel ancient. I suppose that these twenty-five years have seemed short because they have been very busy and basically happy ones, Four years of medical school and five more years of surgical 858 ] training were so demanding that my only non-professional achieve ment in that decade was a brief leave-of-absence to gee marricd, During the first couple of years in private practice, 1 wasn't swamped by patients but found my time fairly well occupied by clinic work, teaching and hospital conferences. It was pleasant, after those nine years, to be relatively free for evenings and weckends. There was finally time to be with friends, begin at golf and enjoy family life My reputation apparently spread, because in 1953 the Government heard about me and invited me to join the surgical service of the Army hospital at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Actually my two years there were surprisingly enjoyable. I had gotten quite busy in my practice and the 8.00 a.M—4.30 P.M. schedule at Bragg was a nice change of pace. As chief of my service, I could delegate the rouune work and handle only the major surgery. Of this there was plenty —a constant supply of fascinating trauma supplicd by the parcachutists at this “Home of the Airborne.” Interestingly cnough, we treated more injuries from auto and motorcy cle accidents when the boys over-exuberantly went “‘on the town” to celebrate a succesful jump than we treated from the actual jumps. The highlights of my two years there were threefold: (1) a 10—point buck shot on the last day of the hunting season, (2) a hole-in-one on the z225-yard 13th hole at the Mid-pines Club at Pinchurst and (3) doing a rectal examination twice (once for each year) on a three-star general",Helen Charlotte Rosenfeld,1934-1938,,

IT was thoughtful of the Class Authorities to provide us with “sample lives” for this Twenty-fifth Anniversary Report. I particularly enjoyed reading Mr. Sidney Carroll’s narrative but noted that though he listed his gains and losses over the years, he did not mention any of the things he had retained. So, with a bow to Mr. Carroll, let me state that I have retained not only my job but most of my hair — and that’s all to the good since with the change of administration in Washington, where I work for the government, hair ts definitely back in style again. I’ve spent more of the last twenty years in radio than in any other field. Since 1951, 1 have worked for the Voice of America, the broadcasting arm of the U.S. Information Agency. My work belies the popular conception of what a government bureaucrat does. Oh yes, there’s a certain amount of integrating, implementing, coordinating, finalizing and ad hocking but my job has to do with the programs—and the VOA being like thirty-eight radio stations 998 ] under one roof, the program side of things is always active, absorbing and, in these times, a continual challenge.

The first seven years centered around military activities and trying to establish a family under war conditions.

I LEFT Harvard with a degree in physics but no firm idca of what I wanted to do. I had vague industrial, scientific and teaching ambstions, but my main purpose was to save some moncy so as to be able to travel. My first job was as a teacher at Pomfret School, and although t enjoyed the teaching, I found the pressure of enforcing clasrooim discipline too great and was soon convinced that I would not make a great secondary school teacher. After a year I left for Plawan with my savings and unfortunately for all concerned ended up again as a teacher, this time in a mission school to the horror of my more religious acquaintances, The year following this I spent in wandering about the Onent This year was exciting and my present viewpoints are combtenes 1029 ] by my memory of the warmth, intelligence and yet incredible poverty of the people I met. I returned to the United States shortly before Pearl Harbor and went to work at Sperry Gyroscope Company as a laboratory engineering assistant. Wartime electronics was very purposeful and I enjoyed my life and work, but by 1945 the prospect of peacetime engineering seemed dull and as a result as soon as the war was over I went to the University of California at Berkeley to study physics. To some extent by accident I ended up in nuclear physics and in this ficld I have remained. Although the day to day operations of this field do not differ very much from those of engineering, the motivations are quite different. I can safely boast, and I do, that I have discovered nothing useful for destroying people, and if my present field of elementary particle physics threatens to become “useful,” this would seem an excellent reason for leaving it",Alberta Jameson,1934-1938,LBY5-2B3,0.48241186

At the same time no one could tell me how one could get experience under these circumstances, How times have changed!! Perhaps the above actually did me a favor —had I been able to start teaching at that time I might never have made the many moves which have led to the permanent transplanting of a “dyed-in-thewool” New Englander. Moving from classified advertising to merchandising and then into time and motion study work started us on the move in 1943. During the next nine years there were many moves — but always in New England. Unfortunately, poor eyes kept me from joining so many of my classmates in the deadly gambits of the early forties.

A FEW years ago I had command of a destroyer awiyned to the { 1163 ] Taiwan Straits patrol. Shortly after leaving Kaohsiung one day, and after exposure to the full brunt of a go-knot monsoon right out of Siberia, we got word that a small Republic of China man-of-war was in distress to the north. We reached it after nightfall. After four hours of violent maneuvering and bilingual swearing we got a line aboard and started to tow it to the Pescadores. By three in the morning, soaking wet, and slightly seasick, I found that we could not steer adequately at the speeds we had to make and concluded that by seven o'clock we were due either to end up on a reef or miss the Pescadores altogether and be committed to a course that could only end up on the coast of communist China. Simultaneously ears I can count as my accomplishments twenty ycars of marriage, which like our car may not be this year’s model but still runs; command of half a dozen ships and units, the most recent a destroyer division, with no certifiable disasters; graduation from law school and admission to the D.C. bar with the resultant determination never to be a lawyer; residence up and down both coasts and a consequent conviction that what is in between is all Texas, is all dull, and is just something to be gotten through as fast as possible — or in the case of the South something to be gotten out of as fast as possible, the above-mentioned offspring who are healthy, cheerful, and at times even give vague glimmerings of intelligence, and the previously mentioned wife, Patricia, who has done such a remarkable job of keeping the home fires burning during my frequent and lengthy absences",,"JOHN JOSEPH REIDY, JR.","Captain, U.S, Navy","Town Meeting Representative, Town of Swampscott, 1952-62; member of vestry, 1959-62, chairman, Finance Committee, 1961-62, Church of the Holy Name— Episcopal, Swampscott; member of board, Council for Better Schools, Swampscott, 1959-61; treasurer, Clarendon Club, Boston, 1961-62",,Patricia Ann Harrington,1934-1938,,

AS reality, like beauty, is very much in the eye and mind of the beholder, I am sure there are as many Harvards as there are Elarvard men. Regrettably, my Harvard was in the days of insufficient room in the Houses for impecunious students without redeeming virtues. I look back with neither nostalgia nor pleasure on years lived in dilapidated buildings in odd corners of the College amid the academic casualties and Harvard’s own delightful delinquents. We were, to use a phrase I believe I coined, the “Out-House Men.” The Harvard I knew was long on the humanities and short on human values.

J have three children (our first, Nicky, died of leukemia when he was five), Sarah, sixteen, in her second year at Milton; Cathy, thirteen, in the eighth grade at Potomac, across the river in Virginia; and Amos, nine, in his first year at St. Albans in the Cathedral School complex, who prowls around the house in a hooded outergarment hugging an imaginary football. We have two dogs —a “Jones (or Norwich) terrier of increasingly uncertain temper, and a black cocker, who piddles with emotion at the merest suggestion of attention. Finally, two birds, strikingly marked, the likes of which we first saw in the bird market in Barcelona, and subsequently bought at our local Five and Ten.

In preparation for this assignment, I was placed in a leading slaughter house to learn the meat business. After about nine months I emerged from this first stage of my career, bloody but unbowed. I was then enrolled in the family business as a salesman. If you've ever tried to sell meat machinery though the medium of a Harvard accent to butchers who ran away from home at an early age you'll know how successful | was. In view of these problems, I was shortly called into the plant and made president, which office, surprisingly enough, I held for twenty years. After more ups and downs than a twelve-year-old boy can get out of a yo-yo we sold the company. This brings our little history up to June, 1960 (our Twenty-second Reunion year). Having acquired by this time a beautiful wife and four demanding children it was imperative that I find a new vocation, post haste. After giving this problem considerable thought for a few days I finally decided to become a combination export manager. If you don’t know what a combination export manager is you are in good company because I was in this business about a year before I really knew myself.

IT’S difficult to set down in a few words the path my life has taken, from failure to complete the four years at Harvard to a position of great satisfaction in working as a layman for the Church. After departure from Harvard in 1935 came years of academic barnstorming, to the University of Virginia, some flying and airline experience on the west coast, and then back for a degree at Bard College just before the start of World War II. A brief tour as a draftce in the Infantry in 1942, then OCS and a commission as a second lieutenant of Infantry, a sudden opportunity to serve as aide to an Artillery brigadier general, and then service in the ETO, as a captain of F icld Artillery. 1433 ] Somewhere in the midst of this military career came the highlight — marriage. Postwar years of teaching and the general insurance business saw the birth of three sons who now begin to really stretch their wings and break the umbilical cord. The purpose and meaning which a happy marriage and three kids gave life led very purposefully to the Church — both in gratitude and in search of a deeper meaning to life. Exposure to a very dedicated and dynamic English clergyman marked a real turning point in my own personal life and its direction and meaning. This was followed by growing participation in the life of the Church as a layman at both the parish and the diocesan level. In late 1960 the Bishop approached me about taking on a fulltime job as secretary-treasurer of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts to replace the person who was retiring. In January, 1961, I started what has been as exciting and satisfying a challenge as anyone could face. It took about eighteen months to settle personal affairs in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and sell the general insurance agency I had operated for ten years, and in September of 1962 we moved to Cambridge",Frances Ragland,1934-1935,,

Following over five years in the Army during World War II, the temptation to join the Foreign Service gave way to the more crass, materialistic lures of a large advertising agency.

Having spent twenty of my twenty-five in the Navy, I think you can see the analogy and why I am prompted to tell my story in two parts. On the Navy side: There really isn’t any point in saying in detail where I was, in what position, and what I did to win wars, cold wars, and peaces from 1941 to 1961. It wasn’t that spectacular a naval career! But it was more fun than otherwise; and, by and large, there was a satisfaction in playing some small part in the events of our time. It was fun to be in Japan, mainland China, Hong-Kong, Indo-China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand and in Italy, France, Spain and England, with two trips around the world as well. And we got done a few things thought useful in spite of the bureaucracy — and without court-martial.

Teaching came into focus for me, however, only after a series of preliminary steps which did not seem to be leading to teaching, Three years at the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge brought me into touch with Christianity — a subject which had only interested me as an objective curiosity in the field of history and literature. This awakening, which many of my friends then and since might describe as a dimming of consciousness, propelled me into the active ministry of the Church. Several years in the pastorate and a few more in the chaplaincy of the Navy convinced me that something was awry; what was in fact going on in the churches seemed dissociated from the Gospel. This sense of discontinuity was deepened by a year of meditations on Karl Barth’s Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans while attempting to minister aboard a repair ship much like Mr. Roberts’ cargo ship. Without more ado, I returned to Harvard’s Department of Social Relations to work out some of these perplexities. My wife, who had entrusted her fate to a parson in 1942, found herself looking after several children in a rectory in Foxboro, Massachusetts, while the parson tried to work out the role of the Church in American society.

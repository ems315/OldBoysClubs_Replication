OFFICES HELD: Captain, U.S. Naval Reserve.

NOT too long after that occasion in June, 1933, when I found
myself facing the world with a Harvard diploma and no job,
along came an opportunity to join Admiral R. E. Byrd’s Second
Expedition to the Antarctic, which I didn’t stop twice to con-
sider. That accounted for the next two years and it wasn’t easy
to settle down afterwards in the relative confines of New York
City. Weekends I spent mostly in Connecticut, taking an active
part in Naval Reserve activities, which, as things turned out,
served as a valuable training for the future — just as Uncle Sam
said it would.

Shortly after World War II broke out in Europe, the Navy
sent out its first call asking reserve officers to volunteer for
active duty “not to exceed one year.” Aly “one year” lasted sev-
enty-six months. The first two years were fun. The heavy
cruiser Lozisville, my first ship, seemed to draw all the interest-
ing assignments: war games with the Pacific Fleet, a goodwill

tour of South American east coast ports and a non-stop dash
with a cargo of gold bullion from Capetown to New York,
Next, a tour at the Naval War College and soon after Pearl Har-
bor, back to sea again, all in the Pacific except a few months at
the end of the war commissioning a new cruiser in Boston and
shaking down in the Caribbean.

I became very well acquainted with the South and Central
Pacific, survived the sinking of one ship, the U.S.S. Helena, and
spent a few trying hours watching a Japanese fleet attempting
unsuccessfully to sink our “jeep” carrier with large calibre gun-
fire, aided by a number of Kamikazes. They didn’t succeed, but
their near misses put us out of combat service, so two weeks
later I found myself back in San Diego arranging for repairs,
and meeting for the first time my second son, who was eight
months old ‘by then.

Our home was in Coronado, a delightful place to spend the
first year after the war, getting reacquainted with my family
and meanwhile looking over the job situation — first choice,
anywhere in California. I finally joined Equitable Life, was sent
to San Francisco and have remained here ever since.

With two boys in high school, a frequent subject of discussion
is the relative merits of various colleges and, more importantly,
how to get admitted to one’s first choice in these days of intense
competition, not to mention soaring costs. We usually conclude
by agreeing one should aim for Harvard and if successful, in
meeting her requirements, admission elsewhere probably won't
be too difficult. Maybe it will actually work out that way.

TEN years ago I reached the top rung of the academic ladder, pro-
fessor and head of the department. I have gathered a staff, and
together we teach and do research on how drugs affect living
systems. Our most important product is the human one, the
medical students we teach, and the (few, as yet) young men and
women we help to make in our own image, as pharmacologists,
whether M.D.’s or Ph.D.’s. Let your college-aged offspring
know that here’s a career to consider: fascinating work, fine esprit
de corps, more jobs than applicants — satisfying to those who like
to work with their hands as well as their heads.

Our children seem to do well in the outside world, while ex-
pressing their aggressive tendencies at home. Long ago we decided
that this is not a bad way of raising children. (Don't get the
idea we chose it.) Trouble with children is, they grow up and go
away. Phoebe is a freshman at Radcliffe. Nick is a high school

junior, having to think about careers and where to go to college
(guess where! ). Toby is only twelve, and I cling to him, knowing
that soon he will go too. We have always made a family practice
of traveling; on our way to and from Cape Cod, we have visited
the holy places: Plymouth Rock, Monticello, Gettysburg, etc.
Toby and I read Ohio history together, he for seventh grade, I for
fun. We drive to the places we read about.

In ’55 and ’56 we spent a sabbatical year in England. Travel
in our own car was glorious. We planned lots of variety for the
children — not too many churches and museums, you know —
and the adults enjoyed i it just as much. Life in England was un-
comfortable and chastening. We learned to value American ways,
especially American schools, very highly.

No longer do I work regularly in civic organizations. This
represents slowing down as well as avoiding the frustrations of
the organizations, as I saw it. Instead, I read more, mainly about
the rise and fall of other societies. This makes me brood about
ours. Though I can stomach neither national party, I manage to
work at the polls every election day, and, no matter what the
result of the election (so far), I emerge exhilarated by the peepul,
in whom, under our frontier-built society, I have great faith.

I ‘BELIEVE the first twenty years after college were adequately
covered in previous reports. The last five years have seen few
changes in my life except that the family is that much older,
bringing four of them into teenage at the same time, with all its
problems and experiences. My oldest boy finished a three-year
stint in the Navy and enters Harvard Engineering School this fall.
My only daughter is at Junior College and the remaining boys
are in various schools in New England. After having been active
in various businesses, am very. content to be spending my time
between Smith House (a restaurant on M.I-T. property in Cam-
bridge) and my original business, Microfilm. Am deriving much
satisfaction few “pioneers” have of seeing many of their dreams
in a new industry become a reality and enjoying a business
association with a fine group of people.

Besides being active in our New England Microfilm business,
I am acting as executive secretary of a group of fourteen similar
companies located throughout the country and coordinating
their purchasing, advertising and general promotion, This w ork
takes me away from New England periodically on trips which I
find most stimulating, I also. continue to enjoy working with
people on Town, Church and Class Committees, as well as taking
part in sports such as tennis (doubles only now!), squash, sailing,
fishing and spectator sports with the children,

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

ARCHITECTS were a dime a dozen in 1933, so as a depression
graduate my first slightly gainful occupation was as a wool
sorter’s assistant in the American Woolen Company i in Lawrence,
Massachusetts. My boss ran a local “‘jernt” on the side, where the
other employees and I adjourned in the evenings for bouts with
- Bacchus. Thanks to my Cambridge education in same, I survived.
By the winter of 1934 the textile business didn’t need me or anyone
else, so off to Europe I went on family business only to encounter
Jim Blaine, ’11, who convinced me that banking was a fine occupa-
tion. The same summer I was fortunate enough to be invited on a
cruise to the Galapagos Islands off the coast of Ecuador, where
we had marvelous big game fishing and bird shooting.

October, 1934, found me a credit investigator in the Marine
Midland Trust Company of New York, working for a Yale man
and checking the credit responsibilities of various butter and egg
operators in New York City. A few expeditions south for bird
shooting and north for skiing occupied my spare time until love
and bank branch operations involved me in 1937. Courting
Rosamond Hodges, a lovely New York debutante, all night, found
the bank on the short end of my daylight services. For many
years it has been generally understood in Wall Street that Jim
Blaine hired me because of my bride. Now, once and for all, I
wish to correct the rumor, because the young lady actually said,
“I do,” on April 22, 1938, with Henry Nickerson, Oakley Brooks,
Tom Torrey, and Pen Lewis of our Class assisting. We had a
wonderful European honeymoon as Europe was preparing for
war. Airdromes were springing up all over southern England
and the roads were full of military convoys.

Having become an assistant treasurer of the Marine Midland
Trust Company in 1937, I found myself, upon my return from
Europe, a branch manager of the coal and iron office of the bank,
and my wife in bride’s school learning how to bake and eat cake.
Weekends were spent shooting or skiing with threats of taking
one day to look for a country hideout. On May 1, 1940, a son and
heir, Stirling S. Adams, Jr., showed up to keep us occupied.
About the same time Charlie Bound, ’32, persuaded me that a
commission in the Naval Reserve would be worth considering.
In September of that year the Adamses left their baby and went
on a hunting trip to Alberta, Canada, where we had a fascinating

[7]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

time shooting moose, caribou, sheep, goat and mule deer. As
we were riding into the hunting country north of Jasper Park, we
stopped at a ranger’s cabin and listened to a broadcast of the
bombing of London by the Germans.

I went to Washington in January, 1940, for an indoctrination
course in naval intelligence, and the promise we would not be
called up for active duty until war was declared. Such was not
the case and on June 1, 1941, I reported for active duty. Then
came Pearl Harbor and I went into uniform and four and one-
half years of active duty censoring cables on a concrete ship at
67 Broad Street, New York City. The same year, without doing
any actual searching, we learned of an old farm in Millbrook,
New York, owned by an estranged couple wishing to divide
community property. We proceeded to steal it. Soon Rose and
I were building our country hideout which was s finished after
Pearl Harbor.

During the war, gas rationing provided little opportunity in the
summer to do other than head for Long Island to a charming spot
called Point-O’-Woods, where only bicycles and express wagons
were needed. I almost forgot: our daughter showed up in
December, 1941, just after Pearl Harbor. As V-J Day Passed our
last offspring appeared. |

Returning to the Marine Midland Trust Company as a vice-
president, I traveled the southwest part of the country and learned
about Texas first-hand. This was an interesting job until I was °
tempted in February, 1953, to enter the sales finance business as
an assistant vice-president in the treasurer’s office of Commercial
Investment Trust, Inc. I traveled more of the country, but only ©
the larger cities, handled more money and did business with more
banks than I ever thought existed. With a debt in excess of a
billion dollars, checks and notes of millions now looked like
chicken feed, a

These days I spend most of my time selling commercial paper
notes to corporate treasurers for short-term investment and hand-
ling credit lines with nearly five hundred banks throughout the
country. |

HARVARD BROTHER: John Quincy Adams, °31.

OcCUPATION: Vice-president, Sheraton Corporation; various facets of hotel
management.

OFFICES HELD: Treasurer, Adams Security Company, American Academy of
Arts and Sciences; vice-president, Massachusetts Self Insurers’ Associa-
tion, The Colonial Society; administrative board, The Adams Papers;

torical Society; American Antiquarian Society; Colonial Society; Club

DURING the early thirties I wrote editorials and an occasional
feature article for the Boston Herald. About 1935 I went to work
for F. C. Dumaine, a financier noted for his temper and his intel- ~
ligence. He was kind to me, and after a year in his office, one
of the most educational of my life, he put me to work for the
Waltham Watch Company. In 1937 I spent an interesting three
months in Switzerland and France, buying watch parts and
machinery. In 1940 I married Ramelle Cochrane, daughter of
F, D. Cochrane, ’99, and we lived very happily in one end of
a disused stable till Pearl Harbor day.

In 1942 I was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Air
Force. My wife closed up the house and went to live with rel-
atives, bringing with her one child in arms. Our second son
was born in Massachusetts while I was in Idaho, our third in
Kansas when I was in Florida. War may amuse some men, I
doubt if it gives much pleasure to women.

In Salt Lake City, I was filling out an elaborate questionnaire
painstakingly. One who had served in 1918 said, “Why do you
take such trouble? The Army warits to know two things about

[9]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

you: where you come from and what you can do—so it can
assign you to the precise opposite.” Being perhaps the worst shot
in the Air Force, I was sent to Spokane to become a gunnery
officer. This was wonderful. I learned to shoot a shot gun and
became proficient at skeet, and later enjoyed many hours of
hunting in the wild country of Idaho and on the Kansas plains,
Unfortunately, the Army discovered, about half way through
the war, that shot gun shooting was the worst possible training
for air to air gunners. So then we concentrated on synthetic
trainers, which were no fun and of doubtful value. My only
useful contribution to the war effort was the introduction of
radio controlled target airplanes. These may have been helpful.
But from first to last our efforts to train great numbers of men
to a rapidly changing technology were no more than groping.
Today, such efforts would be useless. Technology has taken
over completely. A few men, well trained and equipped, can
destroy almost everything. Armies are now obsolete and, let
us hope, the whole military profession.

On returning to civilian life I was lucky to join the com-
paratively new and rapidly expanding Sheraton Corporation.
For it I do a great variety of jobs, from buying insurance and
food, to running laundries and checkrooms. My department is
called Allied Activities, as being a convenient catch-all for any
job too small or too dirty for wiser or more fastidious men.

My wife and I bought the stable where we had lived when we
were first married, soon after I left the service in 1946. Gradually
we have enlarged the living quarters, taking over horses’ stalls
as the children grew older and more children were born. There
is very little room left for horses now, although one old one and
one young one inhabit the space where hay used to be kept.
We have managed to buy some of the fields and woodlands sur-
rounding and hope to fend off progress at least until our chil-
dren grow up. But the American passion for cutting down trees
and laying down macadam and letting the fields grow up to
pseudo ranch houses makes it a tough fight.

In the summer we inhabit a corner of a huge and hideous
structure, built about the time of the Civil War as a resort hotel,
on a point of land off Cohasset. It is a scene of utter desolation
populated by some ten families with numerous children, But

[10 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

the view from the point, over the limitless sea, beyond granite
islands red and pink, and half tide rocks brown with sea weed,
is the most beautiful on earth. As the land is sinking at the rate
of a foot a century and the Russians or the Americans may melt
the polar ice cap and sink the place any day, we do our best to

enjoy it. Sailing is my passion and my wife is devoted enough

to go along with me when we race our 110 against our children’s

in the Cohasset fleet.

But this summer we mean to take the four boys to France in
the mild hope that they will absorb a little culture, or failing
that, at least enough of one foreign language to interest the ad-
mission authorities at Harvard in their future. Both possibilities
seem remote. You never can tell.

MENTAL processes certainly seem to slow up with advancing
years, so it is not easy to remember details of the last twenty-five
years of my life, The years following graduation seem to blend
into one another, and I can only remember certain highlights, I

[ur]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

do know I went to law school at the University of Minnesota, and
after graduating in 1936, I commenced my legal career with a
firm that fortunately for the times specialized in bankruptc
practice. I was kept so busy for three years that I didn’t have
time to realize I wasn’t earning much of a living. In 1940 the
family retail jewelry business beckoned and here I’ve been ever
since. There are no regrets on this score. It has been an interest-
ing challenge.

In 1940 1 undertook marriage and about a year later contracted
for a house. This was rash indeed because by then the price of
construction had advanced ten per cent over the preceding
year. Our dream castle complete except for gutters, paint, and
any landscaping came to the staggering total of $7075. We're still
in the same house, although I will admit several additions have
cost more than the original construction.

Ann and I have managed and are presently trying to cope with
three children, John, now fourteen, Susan, twelve, and Kathy,
nine. Our main object in life is to live from day to day and meet
the multitudinous problems that arise. We find ourselves bound
up in many organizations. We have decided that there is nothing
a true red-blooded American likes better than to be part of an
organization, a vast majority of whose members are either officers,
directors or heads of committees. Needless to say, in nearly
every case there is a good opening for a finance chairman.

With the years I have kept interested in athletic pursuits. Ann
and I ski when weather and finances permit. (This in spite of my
shaky start climbing Mt. Monadnock on skis bound in ropes back
in 1932.) We have been lucky enough to be able to ski most of the

major areas of this country and even had one tour of three weeks’
skiing in Switzerland in 1955. It is now a family sport and a good
one. Individual differences in ability don’t matter so much, and
we five have had many good times together, We also seem to
play a bit of tennis and water ski, and I have continued playing
squash on a regular basis. |
Every once in a while I try to take time to think of what type
of world we are offering to our children. The Atomic Age may

bring prosperity or destruction. We are not particularly con-
cerned in working to create a large monetary legacy, but it would
be wonderful if I could feel that I was making some small con-

1933-41 — These years passed quickly and unobtrusively while
I lived in Boston and worked i in the photography and publishing
business.

1942-46 — Entered on active duty with the Air Forces in
August of ’42 as a first lieutenant and was relieved from active
duty in October, ’46, as a lieutenant colonel.
1946-57 — Settled in Florida and we enjoy living here, The
general pace is slower and yet just as much seems to be accom-
plished. Businesswise the feeling is obvious here that the State
is still pioneering and consequently there are many phases of

the development program still uncharted, unstarted and/or in
early stages of growth. Our main business interests have been

concerned with supply of materials for, and participation in,
the building of underground utility systems.

Lucy and I find that most of our off-time is devoted to general
family activities and interests and, of course, enjoying winter
visits from our northern friends. I manage to get in some good
deep-sea fishing but more often I spend my leisure time playing
soft-ball, water skiing, or swimming with the children and
their friends.

Withal, we believe we have been singularly blessed with what
we consider the important things in living: happiness in our
home, good health, somewhat more than the necessities of living
and a spiritual sustenance which has maintained and supported
us over the rough spots and made us knowledgeable whence, and
humbly grateful for, all that has come our way.

GRADUATION from college was followed by four years of
grinding study at the University of Texas Medical School, during
which I worked in research in summer vacations under Dr.
Meyer Bodansky, who though dead for many years, still in-
fluences me to the extent that I still devote any time I can spare
from practice to my research laboratory. I must admit, however,
that his was not the only influence that led me to spend my sum-
mers in the sticky, humid heat of Galveston Island. For there
lived the red head who enchanted me and who finally consented
to marry me shortly after my graduation in 1937. I think, al-
though she has never admitted so, that she must have regretted
it many times, especially during those five long years of intern-
ship and residency training.

And just as I was through with these preparatory years, I
entered the Army for another five years, the last two and a half
of which I spent in the China-Burma-India Theatre under Gen-
eral Stilwell. Our hospital unit was among the first in this area,
and for many months I was a construction boss in Assam, India,
making bamboo houses for our hospital. Then I became the
contagious disease officer which led me into many strange places
and events and through which I saw many strange tropical mal-
adies. Once I had a whole ward full of small-pox cases and had
to vaccinate over two thousand people in one day. We took care
of Chinese troops when we moved on to the jungles of Burma
to a place called Shingbiyang, the wildest jungle ever, and where
the six-month monsoon pours a steady four hundred inches of

[15]

_ HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

rain without cessation. To keep from going nuts I studied
Chinese, but later became fascinated by the language and finally
learned to speak it with some fluency. In fact, toward the end of
our stay I acted as interpreter and medical officer on one of the
first convoys to go over the reopened Burma Road into Kun-
ming, China.

At the close of the war I entered private practice with Dr.
Myron Prinzmetal and spent two years which I shall always re-
gard as most rewarding association with an outstanding man.
These were difficult post-war years of adjustment and began
with the terrific emotional experience of the birth of our older
daughter, Carol. She was a premature twin born three months
early, and she weighed just under a pound. She made medical
history and was a front-page news item for weeks as Baby X
(our name was withheld).. Her survival was a miracle and a
testimonial to her pediatrician, Dr. L. Wolpe. My wife, Mar-
jorie, didn’t even see her in the mcubator until she was two
months old. Carol is now twelve and weighs eighty pounds.
I think our second daughter, Edith, resents the fact that she
was born so normally two and one-half years later.

Since opening my own office in December, 1945, my life has
been again dominated by medicine. Many would regard it as
being very narrowing because each day and some nights are
entirely filled with practice, teaching and working in research.
Any spare time goes to my family, reading, a golf game once a
week, etc. I’ve always loved golf (played on the Winthrop
House team) and manage even without practice to keep my six
handicap. My latest hobby is the Hammond chord organ which
I am at present.mad about. Nearly every year we take a trip
and last year we had a very fortunate break. My lab did the first
animal research on a new heart test, which has since then become
very important — the so-called transaminase test, This work
got me an invitation to speak in Madrid at the International Con-
gress of Medicine, and thus we made our first trip to Europe.
I like color photography with stereos, so if anyone wants an
arm-chair tour of Europe, he can get it in our home.

My little daughter Edith (nine years old) has been reading

over my shoulder while I write and is very unhappy over her

talents promise to be the support of our old age.

GRADUATION from. college was followed by medical school,

of medicine in Salem, Massachusetts, a city of about 45,000, in
1940. In June, 1942, I entered active service in the Army Medical
Corps as battalion surgeon for an antiaircraft artillery unit. We
were eventually shipped to the European Theatre and made the
landing on Omaha Beach in June, 1944. Our outfit took part in
every major battle in Europe, and eventually joined up with the
Russians south of Berlin. I was discharged as a major in December,
1945, having earned the Bronze Medal.

On return to the States I married Wilma Broomfield of Newton,
Massachusetts, whom I had met while she was still at Mt. Holyoke
before I went overseas. We were blessed with two boys and two
girls in four years (no twins), and have had a wonderful time
watching them grow. Restarting the practice of internal medicine
in Salem was and still is a pleasure.

THERE'S not much to tell, really. After taking the Ph.D. at the
[ 18]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

University of Pennsylvania, I came here (University of Illinois)
as instructor in French, in 1939. Commissioned as a lieutenant
(j-g-), U.S.N.R., in 1943, I was immediately assigned to teaching
Romance Languages at the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis.
Demobilized as lieutenant in 1946, I returned here, but switched
to Spanish and Portuguese, and have been here ever since, gradu-
ally rising through the hierarchy to professor in 1955.

My third book, Transitional Probabilities of English Phonemes
(in collaboration) is now being readied for the press; the fourth
one (working title: Introduction to Comparative Romance
Phonology) is in MS. I have taken what advantage I could of
academic vacations to visit: England, Belgium, France (twice),
Spain, Portugal (collecting material for book No. 3), Mexico
(three times), Puerto Rico, Cuba, Gautemala, The third trip to
Mexico was a sabbatical in academic 1956-57, where I wrote the
first draft of book No. 4 in a little house on a hill in Taxco.

_ Have held a number of minor Democratic party offices, not
listed because I can’t remember which ones or when. The first
Stevenson defeat in ’52 was a nasty blow; I foresaw the second
one, and went off to Mexico instead of staying home and working
in the election. Have not resumed political activity since, and
don’t plan to. When the Democrats regain the presidency, after
Nixon’s incumbency (1958-64? ), I expect to be past caring.

My hobby is still small-boat sailing, but I don’t get to practise
it here. My oldest boy, at thirteen, is a quite promising astron-
omer; the others are too young still to have shown much. Aside
from family, my principal interests are in the mathematical theory
of communications as applied to linguistics (subject of book
number three), the new linguistics (subject of number four), and
the applications of these (if any to the analysis and interpretation
of literature. My wife has written A Linguistic Analysis of the
Epic Style of the Cid (now in press), and we are working together
in this field.

AFTER my abbreviated stay at the University, I went into the

mouth, Massachusetts, and opened my own insurance agency
in New Bedford. For the past sixteen years I have remained in
the insurance business with the exception of two years when
I served as warrant officer during World War II, During the
last five years I have purchased several local insurance agencies.

After dabbling in political affairs, 1 soon discovered that my
skin was not tough enough to proceed further than the state level
and that any attempt to seek political office, unless I devoted my
entire time, would have been suicidal to my future.

Farming and shooting have taken up any idle moments, of
which I hope to have more now that my younger son will com-
plete his school education in another year.

AFTER sophomore year at Harvard in 1931, I traveled through
Europe for three months, after which I transferred to M.I-T.
"Architectural School, ‘I completed five years of the course in four
years with the help of summer school, extra hours and some
credits from Harvard.. During. that period of time, in addition to
going to summer school, I managed to travel during the summer
of 1934 to the British Isles, North Cape and into Russia.

After graduating from M.LT. Architectural School in 1935, I
worked for my father’s architectural firm as a construction super-
intendent for five years. Five years later my father passed away
and the present firm of Friedman, Alschuler & Sincere was estab-
lished, in which I became a partner. The firm has concentrated
in industrial, commercial, housing and institutional work. My
professional life was interrupted from 1943 to 1946, W hen I
served as a lieutenant in the U.S. N. R., part of which time I spent
in the Pacific Area.

Our home is in Highland Park where my wife and four children
reside. Currently, child number one is a freshman at Amherst; our
second is a junior at Highland Park High School; the third is in
seventh grade; and our fourth (the only girl) is in the fifth grade.
Four kids, four schools, four P.T.A.’s!

Peculiarly as it may seem, we have enjoyed traveling around
the country as a family group on a number of different occasions
and have found it thoroughly delightful. We have taken such
trips by auto, bicycle, plane or canoe and have taken longer cross-
country trips taking in most of the National Parks between here
and the West Coast, plus other trips to Arizona, Florida and, most

recently, to the Virgin Isles. Last year again, Mrs. “A” and I had
the fun of traveling in Europe.

Because of our interest in tennis, we have a tennis court of our
own and all six members of the family enjoy the game thoroughly.
At this point, however, I have slowed down to the point of limiting
my game to doubles only. I play throughout the winter on an

indoor court with a regular group and manage to stay in reason-
ably good physical condition as a result.

THE past twenty-five years have been happy and rewarding. I
have been extremely fortunate in many things and I have remark-
ably few causes for either complaint or regret.

I don’t know when, precisely, I first decided to enter the news-
paper business. I listed law as my intended vocation in our class
book in early 1933, but by the summer of that year I was out
looking for a newspaper job. In those dreary days, as we all
recall, it wasn’t so much what you wanted to do as what you
could do.

I tried to give my services away for six months free as a cub
reporter, but no one would have me, and I finally wound up with
a training course with an oil company, and later had some evening
jobs on several newspapers.

With this bare minimum of experience and a few thousand
dollars left me by my father, I rushed in to buy a small and
enormously unprofitable daily newspaper in Oil City, Pa., in 1937.
For the next four years I learned the newspaper business at my
own expense. I received all kinds of magnificent experience, lost
every dime I had, and when I was called to active duty as an
ensign, U.S.N.R., in July, 1941 (I received a commission in
Naval Intelligence in 1937), I sold the paper, much over a barrel,
in December of that year.

During the next four years I was successively an Aide to the
Commandant of the Philadelphia Navy Yard, was graduated from
the Naval War College in Newport and the Marine Corps Com-
mand and Staff School in Quantico, spent two years overseas,
first as F lag Secretary to Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner, who
commanded the Amphibious Forces, and later as Junior Naval
Adviser to General Douglas MacArthur,

[23]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

I participated in seven major campaigns, got the Legion of
Merit and can truthfully say I never once got bored. Being on the
bullseye with two major commanders was about as fascinating

experience as a war can be.

Following my return from overseas I re-entered the newspaper
business. I was supremely happy in Syracuse, but in 1955 Mr.
S. I. Newhouse, who owns the Post-Standard in that city, pur-
chased the St. Louis Globe-Democrat and asked me to come here
to run it. The past three years in this state have been the best of
my life. |

The newspaper business itself is an ever-changing and com-
pletely fascinating career and St. Louis has been more than hos-
pitable to Janet, our family and me. I am considerably | busier
than I should like to be but I am not sure that I would be “entirely
happy if it were otherwise.

While there are many things in the past ‘twenty- -five years
that I would have done differently, I have no quarrel whatever
with the main stream of my life. With a magnificent wife, three
splendid children and a profession that I love, I have been far
more blessed than anyone could reasonably hope to be. |

of: foreign affairs and. the cunning of foreign peoples. Due to
Depression economy, no such examinations were held between
1932 and 1936, and: during the three years I was obliged to wait
(filled by bank*and newspaper jobs) I was conscious, with a
growing uneasiness, that the supposedly fluent grasp of facts
and ideas I had acquired was rusting considerably. This situa-
tion was met by attending a cramming school in Washington,
where the emphasis on knowledge for its purely functional value
contrasted starkly with the atmosphere at Harvard.. This spe-
cialized institution in Washington proved its value, and in 1937
I found myself taking the oath of office as a Foreign Service
officer in an undertaking establishment in Manhattan (as the
mortician was the nearest notary public) before embarking for

[25]

Le Havre and the job of American vice-consul there. I will not
dwell on the trials of the early years (or of the middle and later
years either, for that matter). I can only say that it came as no
surprise to anyone that my impact on Franco-American relations
was negligible.

Twenty years and several countries later, the worth of my
exposure to wisdom by the Charles has been impressed on me.
Not so with a number of preconceptions or illusions which ]
will credit to myself. Take one of these: the idea of the “differ-
entness” of foreign peoples from Americans. I cherished this
half-conscious notion for a good while before it became clear
that the important thing was the basic sameness of peoples. This
discovery was of considerable value to me, as it showed that
foreigners and their government officials should be dealt with
as frankly as possible, and with the same ordinary politeness
accorded in any town in the United States. At the same time,

the realization that the sinister guile of the traditional diplomat
of fiction was not the tool I had thought it was came as some-
thing of a disappointment. |

_ After seven years of roving, I was able to persuade a Miss
Betts of Washington, D.C., that she should share this sort of
thing with me. For a bride, the undertaking of wifely duties
of all kinds can be no laughing matter, and I gather that Mary
found that doing this while coping with a new language, new
customs and no supermarkets was something else again, but she
made less heavy weather of it than I would have done. Virginia
Randolph (called “Prinny” —for “Princess” —by an English
friend of ours when she was a few days old) was born in London
in 1947 during my time in the Embassy there. She was followed
by another remarkable child (Thomas Stratton) in 1951 in
Washington, while I was doing a stretch in Foggy Bottom. They
are now in the fifth and first grades in an American armed
forces school in Oslo, and, while I do not have to do their home-
work, I can see that my education will soon have to be renewed
for the second time. | . |

As to politics, I belong to neither party as I have no domiciliary
residence in the United States and would doubtless find it hard
to convince a scrupulous registration official, at this stage any-

way, that I should be enrolled. My views may be described as

the Marine Corps who never went overseas.

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

My release from active duty came in October, 1945; and early
the next year I bought a small woodworking business in Roches-
ter. This grew too fast in some way and not fast enough in
others so rT developed ulcers which were finally operated on in
1952, then in 1955 I had a heart attack. This was enough for me,
so I left the woodworking business, having sold the controlling
interest in the company.

Now, I had always loved boats, particularly sailboats, and in

1954 I had had built the boat that I had dreamed about for many

ears. This was Qed which was and is an auxiliary sailboat.

She has ample cruising accommodations for four and we can
trail her behind our car. Qed proved so successful that the Mt.
Desert Yacht Yard, who built her, and I started a one-design
class, based on her design, called the “Amphibi-Con.” Mt. Desert
had been building light displacement, reverse sheer boats they
called “Controversys” and this became the “Amphibious Con-
troversy” (or “Amphibi-Con”). There are now over sixty of
these boats scattered about the country and I am in the boat
business. I shall probably never make a dime in the boat business,
particularly since we specialize in sailboats and not pastel-
colored, jet-finned outboards, but I am doing what I like to do
and having a lot of fun at it and, after twenty-five years of
other things and ulcers and a heart attack, I think that is ‘pretty
important.

We have three children and I'm rather proud of all of them.
Betsy, the eldest, after two years at Smith College, is currently
at Katharine Gibbs School in Boston learning to be a good secre-
tary so she can afford to get married next September, to a young
man we, fortunately, like very much, This is certainly the mod-
ern approach and I think I approve of it. CE.A., 3d (Chuck),
is at Exeter. He is red-headed, plays left halfback on the foot-
ball team, is on the Student Council, etc. Although he has re-
ceived invitations from such eminent individuals as the director
of athletics at Yale to consider other colleges, he has decided to
go to Harvard next year if he can get in. Finally, there is Ann
who is still at home and is a very grown-up young lady of
fourteen.

So, that’s about it. The twenty-five years since college have
certainly been interesting. Despite not straying very far, ge0-

graphically speaking, there have been many .happy moments,
many very difficult ones and some very exciting adventures. I

TO review the highlights of more than half one’s lifetime —
even a comparatively dull one —is no easy task. Many things
which once appeared to be of prime importance have, with the |
passage of time, become insignificant or have even been for-
gotten. However, some events continue to stand out as mile-
stones in a journey which has taken me halfway around the
world and finally brought me to Virginia, the Old Dominion
State and home of ‘‘massive resistance.”

After becoming a member of the Massachusetts bar in 1 Novem-
ber, 1936, I ventured into the private practice of law in the
highly competitive Boston area at a time when many older and
more experienced lawyers were contemplating becoming apple
vendors. Those were tough days financially and even a six-
month stint in the law department of an insurance company did
not brighten the picture to any appreciable extent. However,
conditions slowly improved and in the summer of 1943 I was
married to a Boston schoolteacher. Before I could really appre-
ciate the advantages of this new way of life, I found myself one
of many raw recruits at Fort Devens, Massachusetts, I had barely
time to memorize my serial number when I was sent to Camp
(now Fort) Lee, Virginia, for basic training in the Quarter-
master Corps. After a tour of duty in the British Isles, I was
returned to Fort Lee for O.CS. training and commissioning as
a second lieutenant in July, 1943. Before being separated from
active service in January, 1946, I managed to take a boat ride
to Manila and celebrate V-J Day in that community. I have
maintained an active Reserve status since discharge and achieved
the rank of major in 1953. At present I am instructing a class of
Reserve officers in advanced Quartermaster subjects. Education
seems to play a major part in our family, Mrs. Auerbach having
returned to teaching in 1950 and subsequently accepting a prin-
cipalship in the Fairfax County (Virginia) school system.

I have been with the V.A. since 1946 and have made moder-
ately good progress in the climb toward a position of some
responsibility and status, May I, at this point, assure those who
have not had much contact with Federal employees, that the

[ 33]

overwhelming majority of civil servants are not bureaucrats
feeding out of the public trough, but rather are dedicated people
whose compensation is more in the form of self-satisfaction (at
doing a good job) than in terms of coin of the realm.

We are deriving great enjoyment out of watching our two
daughters grow up into attractive, self-sufficient young ladies.
Our elder one is beginning to direct her thoughts toward selec-
tion of a college. Not having been blessed with sons, I am de-
lighted with the establishment of greater academic rapport be-
tween Harvard and Radcliffe, and am nurturing the hope that
one or both of our girls might want to attend college in Cam-
bridge.

I miss the opportunity of visiting Harvard more frequently,
especially at Commencement time. At the time of this writing,
I can’t tell whether I shall be able to come up for “the ‘'wenty-
Fifth.” I sincerely hope I can, It will be good to revive the
many pleasant days of a quarter of a century ago.

IN June of 1933, three months after our country’s banks had

banker. Three years later the institution had recognized my
sterling qualities by awarding me a buzzer, a dictaphone and
functional desk, as well as $19.50 per week. I am obviously
greedy for money. I left to become a salesman of (horrors!)
chewing gum, at a vast increase in stipend. Since then America’s
economy has been blessed by my unflagging efforts as a sales-
man and sales manager of automobile polish, hearing aids and,
currently, a very wonderful product: Compton’s Pictured En-
cyclopedia, which I sincerely hope all of my classmates have
already purchased or will appear at the Twenty-fifth Reunion
prepared to purchase forthwith, accepting no substitutes claimed
to be “just as good.”

This, you see, has been a “grey flannel suitish” kind of life,
but a good one, blessed by marriage to a beautiful, charming,
intelligent, patient, conscientious Anne who has mothered three
demanding, destructive, disobedient, untidy, lazy, mischievous
and unreasonable boys whom we love dearly and who, I hope,
may eventually enter Harvard’s halls of learning.

THE past twenty-five years have been particularly happy ones
for me because I have had work which I enjoy, good health and
an absorbing family life.

The year I spent in Washington immediately following gradu-
ation was an exhilarating one. Most of my contemporaries and
acquaintances there were in government service, and I could not
help catching some of their enthusiasm for the new day which
they saw dawning. As I look back on the choices I have made
of presidential candidates since 1928, it seems to me now I have
voted wrong as often as I have voted right.

The three years spent in Hartford from 1934 to 1937 were
sandwiched between a brief period of study with an enterprising
portrait photographer in Houston, Texas, and a few months of
play and study in London. Hartford was a pleasant place to live
in those years in which we were slowly emerging from the de-
pression, and it was there I first began to find, out what I had
to learn in order to be a portrait photographer.

From 1937 to 1940, I lived and worked in New Jersey, and
it was during this period I was married and our first child was
born. From. 1940 to 1943, I made my headquarters in Boston
and had under my wing six studios in ‘the smaller New England
cities.

I remember the war years as a restful interlude within a fairly
busy life. I was fortunate to be connected with some phase of
photographic work, and in having a position at least for a year

and a half which gave me a certain freedom to travel for the
Navy as I had been traveling for Bachrach, Inc., up and down the
East coast. Never having heard a shot fired in anger during m
naval service, I could not help being impressed by the tremen-
dous waste of manpower during the war — myself included.

Out of uniform in the fall of 1945, I tried to make up for the
time I had lost and for the strain which my absence and that of
my brother from the family business had placed on our father
and other members of the organization. In 1955, while con-
tinuing to do pretty much what I had been doing for the past
few years — training and supervising the work of a number of
photographers —I was named president of the firm.

The nature of our business has greatly changed in twenty-five
years. Today we are doing sixty percent of our business in the
New York area as against about twenty percent in 1933. Today,
as never before, we are dependent on a relatively high average
order, and are somewhat in the position of the man who has to
run in order to stand still. My own greatest satisfactions at work
have come from having been engaged in a creative craft, every
phase of which is fascinating. All of us in our organization of
some two hundred people have tried to produce photographic
portraits as they should be produced (there are no easy shortcuts,
no real time-saving or cost-saving methods worth considering)
and what time we don’t spend in the production of these portraits
we spend in trying to figure out how to make a living from the
sale of them.

Since 1939 I have been greatly helped by my wife, who has
always been sympathetic to the job I have been trying to do,
and who has freed me of much responsibility at home so that
I could do it, We live a fairly quiet “stay at home” life with our
four children, except for an occasional winter and summer vaca-
tion where swimming, skiing and tennis are our principal sports.
We do a great deal of reading and listening to music and lectures
on the FM radio. So far I consider my children quite satisfactory.

IN 1940 I graduated from the University of Chicago and Rush
Medical College. Feeling that there were more opportunities for
establishing a practice in the Great Lakes area, I took my intern
and internal medical training at Harper Hospital in Detroit.
World War II split my post-graduate years into two sections,
1940 through 1941 and 1945 through 1947.

During the war my assignments carried me to the Rocky
Mountain states, Utah, Washington, Colorado, Texas and Cali-
fornia. Having completed the training at the School of Aviation
Medicine, I served in the C.B.I. theatre as a flight surgeon. This
afforded me the opportunity to travel to most of the large cities
of India and to be stationed for twenty-four months in China.
Although military life in war time is necessarily punctuated by
anxieties, I look back on the experiences and travels of those years
as some of my most treasured memories.

Following completion of internal medical training and practice
in Detroit as an associate to another physician, I found a vacancy
in Benton Harbor, Michigan, in 1948, and I moved here immedi-
ately. Until this time I always felt that, since packing my suit-
case and leaving Marblehead on April 9, 1934, my suitcase was
never unpacked. Now on the bank of the St. Joseph River, on
land once owned by Indians (says so in the property deed), I
have built my own house and my bags are unpacked.

My son, John David, was born February 12, 1943, while I
was waiting to board the transport to sail for India. He was
twenty-eight months old when I first saw him. Ten years later,
April 21, 1953, Mary Margaret was born in Benton Harbor.
Margaret, to whom I have been married since December, 1937,
has not been active in her profession of nursing since I went

into the armed forces in 1942. This year she is president of the
Woman's Fellowship of the First Congregational Church of

Benton Harbor. This work is a great comfort to her and she
has done well.

There is no question nor doubt that I am suited, adjusted and
love the private practice of internal medicine. It is comfortable,
enjoyable and satisfying to me. It is a challenge to my creative
abilities. In the ten years which I have spent in Benton Harbor
(a community of 50,000 population) there has been a change
from practice by general practitioners to that of specialists. The
Mercy Hospital has been accredited to training interns in a
rotating internship. During the past four years as secretary of
the staff I have been happy to have had a small part in this
period of growth.

This community is a mixture of small manufacturing com-
panies, fruit farms and summer resorts. ‘The House of David, a
communal type, religious colony is also located here. South
Bend, Indiana, is thirty-five miles south and Chicago, Illinois, is
ninety-six miles around the southern end of Lake Michigan.

My greatest source of relaxation is my family and home. Keep-
ing up on medical reading is my constant problem. I also love
reading deeply into any other subject which strikes my fancy —
be it art, philosophy, psychiatry, history of jazz, writing, or the
creative process. As the oldest son and second child of a family
of five boys and two girls whose father was a small (A{assachu-
setts) town policeman, my childhood wish was that I some day
become a millionaire. This fantasy may have motivated me to
go to Harvard College, but there the seeds were planted which
have grown into a philosophy replacing my boyhood fantasy
with the dynamic question — how do you live a good life?

OF making many books,” says the Bible, “there is no end.”
To which I, in my present position, say, “Thank the Lord.”

I guess books have always been important to me. Back in the
days when I was growing up in Dedham, I discovered the pleasures
of the town’s public library. At Cambridge, the doors of Wid-
ener often beckoned. And after graduation I went to work in
a bookshop. But those were Depression days. The bookshop
folded, and I was on the job hunt. There followed several years
of work on newspapers and trade magazines, doing publicity,
and huckstering here in New York.

I was in my third year writing copy about Esso gasoline and
men’s hats and deodorants and cruises to exotic countries I'd
never visited — when I heard about an opening as advertising
manager in a publishing house. I took it, and it was like coming
out of the subway into the fresh air.

A gas station is a gas station, but every book is different.
Whether it’s Erle Stanley Gardner’s fifty-fifth Perry Mason
story (and we've published all of them) or Margaret Mead’s
latest study on anthropology, or a new novel by Nevil Shute or
Nicholas Monsarrat or Ernest Gann, there’s always some new
way to promote or publicize or advertise it.

Best of all, there’s the lure of what lies ahead. As I climb aboard
the train to Oyster Bay at night, there’s the possibility that the
manuscript or book under my arm will be a “big” one or an
“important” one or a “really funny” one or even a “great” one.

FOUR years in dyestuffs, ten years in steel, seven years in con-
sulting work, and now four years in textiles, culminating in m
present job, to sum up my business career. It may seem like,
and in fact has been, an illogical and unplanned progression, but
has proved to me that the fundamentals of management are the
same for any business and in consequence the experience I gained
in each activity has stood me in good stead.

The only interruption in my career was World War II, which
I entered rather belatedly, joining the Marine Corps in the spring
of 1944. Boot Camp at Parris Island proved to be an experience
I'll never forget or regret, but beyond that I have no -claim to
fame, serving in the Pacific for a year— Ulithi, Guam and
Saipan — but seeing no action.

Foreign places having always had great appeal for me, I par-
ticularly enjoyed my work right after graduation, which involved
my living in France for a year, and a number of trips abroad
thereafter, until I changed jobs in 1938.

Since our marriage in 1937, we have lived in Mount Kisco,
some thirty-five miles outside of New York City. For these
past twenty years [ve complained with increasing feeling about
the daily commuting, and still refuse to accept the idea that Pil
be doing it for the rest of my business life. Actually, having been
born and brought up here in Mount Kisco, I love the place as
do my wife and children.

For a person who feels as strongly politically as I do, I find it
hard to excuse my complete lack of participation in politics. As
a Taft Republican, I have been frustrated since 1932 by never
having a presidential candidate to vote for who has stood for
the things I believe in. We are now so far along the road to
Socialism that even I no longer hope for a reversal of the trend.

Judging from the arguments I have gotten into with my friends,
I question that many of my classmates share my convictions; in

fact, except for this bricf comment, I have finally learned to
keep my mouth shut on the subject.

CIVIL Service provided an opportunity for me after college

At this point the Army claimed me and here I kicked around
until discharged in 1945. Now I was faced with a decision:
should I return to civil service (which had become distasteful
to me) or should I look for some more satisfying job? The
answer was close at hand. My father’s jewelry business seemed
not only a logical but a good choice, I have never regretted it.
This has been my life from 1945 to the present.

AFTER being cast adrift in the summer of 1933, I went to work

[ 48 |

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

could be promised, and rather than play it by ear, I decided to
look in other fields. I attached myself as a trainee, seeking to be
a corporate bond salesman, in Tucker, Anthony & Company
early in 1935.

During this period, I had become romantically attached to
Miss Celia Potter of Brookline, Massachusetts, whom I met as
a blind date at a fraternity dance in the fall of 1932. We became
engaged in 1937, and after much too long a wait, we were mar-
ried on June 1, 1940. During this period I continued with the
bond business, finding it interesting but competitive.

During my years of college I had completed the R.O.T.C.
training in field artillery, and to my consternation I found my-
self called to active duty in April, 1941. I reported to Fort
Bragg for a refresher course and was assigned to the Forty-
seventh Field Artillery, serving with that outfit until the
European war was over. Strangely, I was the only officer who
served with the Forty-seventh Field Artillery throughout its
activation and war service. During the next four and one-half
years I traveled the length and breadth of this country at various
posts, and after landing in England in February, 1944, was
shipped to France in July, to move, with the Fifth Armored
Division to which our unit had been reassigned as armored artil-
lery, across France and Germany until V-E Day.

During this period, two children were born. One, Meredith,
arrived on the day after Pearl Harbor, and during the confusion
the family was unable to notify me for almost two days. A son,
Sheridan, was born the following November, nearly establishing
some sort of record.

After V-E Day I was shipped back to the States and requested
inactive duty, which was approved. I then notified my employer
that I intended to make a change and look around. This I did,
and after a period of mild frustration, I hooked up with the
Trust Department of The New England Trust Company in
Boston. After a period of apprenticeship of approximately two
years, I was reassigned as an account administrator. At present
I head up the Investment Division with a vice-president’s title.

Just to give you some idea of how lucky I am to have a smart
wife, I should point out that her business acumen turned out
to be much better than that of all of my “state-side” friends. In

[ 49 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

1943, during gas rationing, she bought in the suburb of West-
wood a house, much against the advice of her family and all of
my friends. Her reason for doing so was very simple. Although
she was living w ith our two children at her mother’s home at
this time, she wanted a house for the family, when I was dis-
charged. In other words, her view was, if you need something,
go ahead. We have since sold that house for close to three
times the cost and built another one also in Westwood, which
has turned out to be a pleasant suburban community. Since
then, in 1951, we have increased our family by adding a second
daughter, Althea, and although Mommy has complained that
she still is tied down with young children, we wouldn’t trade
her for all the freedom in the world.

Our family is what one would expect with two teen-agers in
high school and a first grader combined. We are about to com-
plicate our problems by buying a dog so that even the present
high level of confusion will certainly increase.

Whatever may be said of banking, the trust business dealing
with human problems has been an interesting and fascinating
one and even though the financial rewards are much more in line
nowadays than they used to be, in any case [ do not expect ever
to own a yacht.

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

HAVING decided that teaching was to be my profession, I
looked forward at graduation to working under George St. John
at Choate. Life decreed otherwise, In July, 1933, I heard for
the first time of the work of Rudolf Steiner and, in particular,
of the educational ideas upon which he had founded the Waldorf
School in Stuttgart, Germany. Here, it seemed to me, the edu-
cational ideals with which I had wrestled in my own thought
during my last year and a half at Harvard had been brought to
practical realization. My first impressions, now confirmed by
nearly twenty-five years of work and experience, were that
Steiner had touched the question at the heart of all education —
the spiritual nature of man and his moral capacity for freedom.

In September, ’33, generously released from my obligation by
Mr. St. John, I was on my way to Germany to study at the
Waldorf School Teachers’ Seminar. During the next seven years
I had first-hand opportunity to watch the life and death struggle
of free institutions against the overwhelming weight of the Nazi
State. (The Waldorf School was finally closed in April, 1938.
It was the first free school to reopen under American Occupation
in 1945.) In July, 1934, I went for six months’ training in work
with abnormal children in Switzerland. The next four and a
half years saw me teaching at Michael Hall, England, the original
Rudolf Steiner School in Britain. In September, 1939, two days
after war was declared, Christy MacKaye and I were married
in Dornach, Switzerland, where we spent our first year together
studying at the Goetheanum within earshot of the French and
German guns along the Rhine.

Returning to the States in June, 1940, we both became teachers
at the Rudolf Steiner School, New York, and, with interludes for
children and the Army, we have been there ever since. The
school is owned and directed by its teachers and I have, since
September, 1948, served the school as chairman of the faculty.
It has been a very great satisfaction to work with a group of
people genuinely devoted to their task and to see the school grow
from a struggling, unknown grade school to the point where,
in September, 1958, it will graduate its first senior class and be
a full-fledged twelve-year elementary and high school, with an
enrollment of 300 boys and girls. The school, now one of six in
the United States, and over sixty in the Western World, and the

[sr]

educational ideas on which it is founded has, I feel very sure, a
real contribution to make to the future of education in America.

Our family is small, but well-content, We spend happy sum-
mers overlooking the Connecticut River valley in Cornish, New

Hampshire. My greatest interests, when time permits, are writing
and spading my garden.

IT appears that I do not having anything to report that is either
amusing or important to the world at large. I have been prac-
tising law in association with my father. During the course of
time I have handled many kinds of matters and have taken care
of some pretty large real estate transactions; and if 1 may venture
to say so, I am under the impression that the clients were entirely
satitsfied with the results.

About ten years ago I was fortunate to meet and then marry
my very fine wife, who comes from the state of Washington,
where most of her family resides, Besides attending the Univer-
sity of Washington, she studied at the Prince School (retailing)
in Boston. She is very interested in department store work, and
has been and still is engaged in that field.

There was a period of over three years when I was in the
military service and during that time I saw parts of England,
France, Belgium and Germany. However, the manner in which
I was traveling was far from that which I would have preferred.
I should like now and in the future to have some vacations and
do some traveling both in this country and abroad, in a style
more of my own choosing, but it just seems that the necessities
of “making a living” and “taking care of things” constantly tie
me down to the office and do not allow me anywhere the leisure
I] am sure I would enjoy.

To sum up with the philosophic reflections which I think
often accompany these jottings, and with the “plea” that I am
not always so serious but in fact have a good sense of humor,
I would say that the way in which I have lived this period of
years has not been inconsistent with the traditions of our Ablna
\fater, in that I have had a regard for the cultural side of life.

at any time.

I HIGHLY recommend to every member of the Class of 1934
to delay in sending in their autobiographies on time, because
they will be entertained by the repetitive needling of post cards
with such statements as “we know that for some it is a psych-
algic experience to write the biography, for others, a literary
pain.” “Merry Christmas, Pal, guess what I want from Santa
Claus — your picture and your life.” I am going to paste all
cards in the flyleaf of my copy of the report as literary decor,
illustrating the ‘“‘mail” anserinus. But alas for 1934, they could-
n’t have a match for our incomparable Don Sullivan, though
Ruth Mahoney will cull the best for use next year, hers amongst
them.

[55]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

Meditating upon my “career history” I perused what I wrote
in our Quindecennial Report in 1948 and quickly decided to let
it repose quietly there rather than exhuming the body. The Vi-
cennial Report, in 1953, “I am happy in the general practice of
medicine by appointment, which seems to be a good scheme for
both patients and physician,” gives the picture as well now as
then. Situated so close to Boston makes it easy to maintain a
stimulated interest in the amazing world of modern medicine,
what with innumerable opportunities to continue postgraduate
studies; yet finding that the service which is of most benefit to
the majority of patients is that of helping them to adjust them-
selves to their changing environment in the flow of their life’s
experience, this is my career.

My family: my wife is the same redhead I fought and loved
while in college, there has been no abatement in either category
and we enjoy ourselves. Susan, with marks consistently higher
than her parents’, will receive her S.B. in education on graduation
from the Eliot Pearson School at Tufts University in June.
Tufts has a better campus than the one at Bradford Junior Col-
lege, there are fraternities on it. She is going to study occupa-
tional therapy next year. Bz is a sophomore at Wellesley Col-
lege —she loves it— also Harvard— commuting seems to be
a major at both institutions, Sam is a freshman at C.U., which
to you easterners is Colorado University — in the western tradi-
tion big mountains, big football, great skiing, big co-ed popula-
tion, the word is — it’s great! ! Hannah at Beaver Country Day
School combining body [varsity in three sports — (not counting
the dance floor)] with brains, being interested in the: biological
sciences —she knows more than I did at seventeen, Finally our
war baby Geoffrey who had better stop growing or his father
won't be able to whip him. At thirtcen, a five-day boarder at
Belmont Hill School, he is perpetual motion. He combines an
incessant question box department with knowing all the answers
— “it’s a fact, Dad!” As a minor outlet he drag races his scooter
bought fourth hand on money he earned this summer. The farm
sounds like LIME ROCK on a Sunday.

My travels consist of the daily round of housecalls, interrupted
only by trips to the Yale Bowl; however, we are hoping to see
whether the word on C.U. is true this spring.

Hobbies: medicine and the family, reading everything and
anything, including Play Boy, hiking in the Blue Hills.

War record: permanently forgotten, I hope.

Social: Milton still retains much of the quality of a New Eng-
land town where many enter into community life, the organiza-

Iam still trying to learn to start home early from the parties on
the lower Canton Avenue Gin Belt. I occasionally show up in
a “stage skit” at the Milton-Hoosic Club.

Political: believing in the inalienable rights of the individual
as of Thomas Jefferson’s Declaration, the free enterprise versus
union conformity to the mediocre, I label myself as a conservative
liberal New England Republican, which I find is definitely a
minority group.

Religious: member of the First Parish of Milton, whose present
Meeting House was dedicated in 1788, where the Unitarian belief
of tolerance towards all faiths in man’s search for the ultimate
truths has been preached since 1834.

IN college I had “concentrated” in Fine Arts, my original profes-
sional aim being a career in art and my particular interest within
this field being that of landscape painting. However, I had also
shown enthusiasm as well as some talent in the violoncello. For
reasons that can probably not be clearly understandable nor justi-
fied, I turned, on graduation, to music and the study of the cello.
During the succeeding years I studied under such well-known
pedagogues of the violoncello, as Hans Hess and Edmund Kurtz
in Chicago, and later in South America, under such eminent vir-
tuosi of the instrument as Oscar Nicastro of Uruguay, Adolfo
Odnopossov of Argentina and Hartman of the itinerant and world-
famous Lener quartet.

During a prolonged stay in Montevideo, Uruguay, where I had
taken up residence as a “pioneer teacher” of the Baha’i Faith, I
continued, in addition to my responsibilities as a teacher of the
Baha’i Faith, my studies in music and the cello and eventually gave
a series of cello recitals in Montevideo and across the Plata River
in Buenos Aires. My stay in Uruguay was roughly coextensive
with the duration of World War II, but I suppose my draft classi-
fication as 4-F explained the fact that I was not called into active
service.

Returning to the U.S. in December of 1945, and faced with the
necessity of providing for my recently-acquired family, I entered
into business, jobs in the music field being then (as they still are
today, to be sure) difficult to obtain and financially precarious.
Nevertheless I held doggedly for many years to my desire for a
musical career (in fact I have been a member of both Dallas and
New Orleans Symphony Orchestras) and only recently have de-
cided to abandon it altogether in favor of a teaching career.

As stated, at present I have my own home here in New Orleans
where I am engaged as teacher of English in a local high school.
I am associated here with the local Baha'i group. It is plain that

[ 58]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

my convictions are those of the Baha’i Faith which recognizes one
God for all mankind and the acceptance of all the great prophets
as mouthpieces of the Divine will throughout man’s history. Ba-
hais believe that the founder of their faith, Baha’wllah, has come
to fulfill the Christian vision of the kingdom of God on earth, and
that this will be accomplished through the universal recognition
of one God, the establishment of a world commonwealth of na-
tions, the uniting of all races, classes and nations in this common-
wealth and a federated world government strong enough to main-
tain the peace.

Politically, I am for universal objectives and therefore non-
partisan. I see no conflict, however, between loyalty to country
(or some other loyalty) and loyalty to God. If we serve one, we
' automatically and simultaneously serve the other.

SINCE my departure from Cambridge in 1933, I have been pretty
steadily occupied in attempting to educate succeeding generations
of young Americans. It has been a gratifying experience and had
I to do it all over again, I don’t think that any other field of en-
deavor would have given me any more pleasure or reward than
that of education.

If there is anything that I regret at this time of reunion, it is
that I was obliged to commute for four years from my hometown
and thereby missed many things that those who lived at the Col-
lege enjoyed. But I would never trade for anything the wonderful

[59]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

experience of singing in the Glee Club under “Doc” and being
thrilled by the excitement of participating in the Boston Sym-

hony concerts. In fact, my interest in music-making has never
ceased and I have held several positions as organist and choirmaster
in the various teaching jobs that I have had.

After many years of being considered the “perennial bachelor”
by my associates, I surprised them all by taking on the responsi-
bilities of family hfe in 1951. I shall have to admit that my Harvard

“sons” will have to attend Radcliffe, but I am given to understand
that Harvard, that once great stronghold of masculinity, is fast
being converted to a co-educational institution.

After graduation I gravitated back to my hometown to take up
a position in the local high school, a position that I relinquished in
1944 with the idea of seeing a bit more of the country. After a
two-year stopover in Pomfret, Connecticut, at the Pomfret School,
I landed in this “mountain paradise” of Asheville, North Carolina,
at a school which differs very little from the fine preparatory
schools of my native New England.

Having traveled over a great part of this country and a goodly
section of Europe, I must admit that Asheville is an ideal place in
which to live (and that is quite an admission coming from one
bred in New England). Of course I shall have to admit that if I
were politically inclined, my New England Republicanism would
hardly be an asset in this land of “solid South” Democrats. How-
ever, a boarding school is scarcely conducive to making political
contacts. In fact, the one great drawback to being an instructor
in a boarding school is that very lack of contact with the outside.
You might say that we are a sort of island or isolated community
which is self-supporting. One has to make an effort not to be
insular in one’s relations with the community at large.

Looking back over the years since Harvard, I can say that those
years have been kind and that I am looking forward to the next
twenty-five with great anticipation.

AT Harvard I developed two enthusiasms that have influenced my
whole life, delight in English literature and in the mountains.
These concerns, though very different, are in some ways com-
plementary and together they have brought me many years of
happiness.

During four years at Harvard I took great pleasure in sessions
with my tutor, Fred White, and courses with Bliss Perry, John
Livingston Lowes, George Lyman Kittredge and other members
of Harvard’s great English Department; but not until my last year
at Dunster House did I know that I wanted to teach. I was not
sure where or whom I wanted to teach but I was keen to find out.
After a year of graduate work at Harvard, I returned to Philadel-
phia to do some practice teaching and to continue work towards
a Ph.D. In the winter of 1935 a brief hiatus occurred when I
joined Brad Washburn on a winter exploration-survey trip to
Yukon Territory for The National Geographic Society, but the
following fall I was appointed instructor in English at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania.

I remained at Pennsylvania four years. The English department
had a fine group of men, but university authorities seemed far
more concerned with research than with teaching. This system
seemed to me unfair both to the undergraduates and to the teach-

[61]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

ers, Accordingly in 1939 I transferred to Phillips Excter Academy,
where my brother was teaching, and there small classes and big
enthusiasms have since given me continual pleasure. With the
exception of the war years and leaves of absence, I have taught at
Exeter since that date.

Summer vacations from Exeter have given me time for my other
major interest, the mountains. My attraction to them goes back
to family vacations at Randolph, New Hampshire, and climbs in
the White Mountains before I was ten. But at college my latent
love of wild country and mountaineering was vitalized anew when
Walt Everett and Brad Washburn took me to Mt. Washington for
some winter camping and climbing. I’ve been climbing ever since.

] joined Brad Washburn twice on trips to the Fairweather Range
in Alaska while we were still in college, and later spent the winter
of 1935 helping him to survey ten thousand square miles of icy
peaks and glaciers in the St. Elias Range. By now expedition life
was so in my blood that after one summer spent half in the stacks
of the Bodleian Library at Oxford and half in the Swiss Alps, I
spent the next one with Brad again, this time climbing Mt. Lucania,
then the highest unclimbed peak in North America. We had a
rough trip coming out and eventually were reduced to a diet of
squirrels and dubious wild mushrooms. The following summer
the trip was even longer. This time the objective was K2, the
second highest mountain in the world. We didn’t climb it, but
reached a record height on the mountain. Again before the war
I was in the Yukon, this time with an American Geographical So-
ciety party testing Army mountain and winter warfare material.

Before I knew it I was on leave of absence helping to develop
equipment for special forces at the Quartermaster General’s office
in Washington. Shortly afterward the war started and I was com-
missioned. In my wartime service I was tremendously fortunate.

My boss was Brigadier General Georges Doriot, in civilian life
a brilliant and original professor at the Harvard Business School.
Thanks to him I served in a varicty of regions: the Hludson Bay
country in midwinter, the top of Mc. McKinley in Alaska, and
even briefly in an eskimo pie plant in Washington, Later I spent
a year and a half in Italy during the fighting in the Apennines.
During most of the war I had the satisfaction of working on
matters 1 was interested in and where I could sce results, but it

[ 62 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

was a pleasure in 1946 to return to Exeter. Since then I have con-
tinued to read, teach, travel and climb. In 1953 I had my last
chance to climb a really big one when a strong American party
again went to Baltistan and K?. Again we went high but once
more we were defeated.

The following spring I married the assistant secretary of The
American Alpine Club, Gail Oberlin, sister of John C. Oberlin, ’35.
It was the best thing I have ever done — and she is now my major
interest! Since that time a leave of absence has permitted us to
have a look at Annapurna and west central Nepal, but for most of
the past four years we have enjoyed life in Exeter. Bliss Perry and
Brad Washburn each gave me a push in a pleasant direction and I
am grateful to them. But my main regret is that I never came to
know John Oberlin — and his sister — when John and I were at
Harvard.

THIS is written while vacationing at marvelously reconstructed
Williamsburg, Virginia, an eye-opening expereince for a dam-
yankee who used to think Thanksgiving was invented by the
Pilgrims. But they do admit, in a sort of stage whisper, that up
north there is one college that is even older than William and
Mary! In comparison with the guidebook glamour of historic
Virginia soil, the story of my last twenty-five years seems as pale

[ 63 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

as the litmus paper in old Mallinckrodt’s labs. So, to whet the
interest of possibly two curious pals who may have read this far,
I now resort to the strategy of surprise: I have become a “sales-
man for religion!” |

Before you jump in amazement to the incorrect conclusion that
I occupy a pulpit, I'd better say right off that I merely work for
one who does: N. V. Peale. My job is to sell Guideposts, an inter-
faith magazine of inspirational stories, to individuals and to busi-
ness firms who think this is better for their employees than tran-
quilizer pills or socialized security pay. .

Descending from the soapbox, I must admit that my path to
this situation has been circuitous, as one would say in English A.
Those first dreams of glory, after returning the cap and gown to
Max Keezer, were abruptly ended on Christmas Eve of 1933 by a
pink slip of dismissal from Macy’s (following an emergency meet-
ing of their top psychiatrists) indicating a complete lack of in-
terest in me as a future merchant prince. Humbled and hungry,
I seized gratefully a job as office boy at Time, Inc., then a Yale
organization eager for diversification. There followed a gamut of
sales promotion activities: helping get advertising into Fortune
magazine, circulation for Cue magazine, sales of stationery items
for the Carter’s Ink Company, real estate contracts for Previews,
circulation for U. N. World magazine; and then six years ago to
Guideposts, which I enjoy most of all, partly because I have seen
the good that it does for some of its million readers. Oops, the
editors of this book will begin to scent a “commercial!”

A pleasant aspect of my business activity is its location in the
country. Instead of trains and perfumed subways, I enjoy a scenic
and uncluttered thirty-minute drive. But really the greatest bless-
ing of all is our delightful family life, now eighteen years along.
How I managed to latch on to a talented and beautiful woman
remains a complete mystery to all friends, and I don’t know the
answer myself. Our three boys and one girl, interestingly spaced
from ages sixteen to three, are fortunately all normal and beloved
companions, and the more cherished in view of our other boy’s
death by accident at the age of five some years ago, These things
have a way of pulling a group together. After a succession of
apartments and assorted cottages, we have come to live in a big
old house on a ridge overlooking the Westchester hills. You can

[ 64 ]

find any or all of us throwing baseballs or footballs on the back
lot any fair day.

Community activities have entered our life in some of the usual
ways. Marilee vice-presidents the Mt. Kisco Junior League, and
when I am not “sitting” with the kids while she dashes to meetings
(woman’s occupational therapy), I occasionally get involved with
school, church or other civic endeavours instead of being sensible
and taking up golf or sitting on my fanny with a book on flying
saucers.

This all sounds disgustingly lucky, and I apologize for any ap-
pearance of parading contentment, for some of us have not en-
joyed good breaks so far. Mysteries cloud the future, as they
always have, so here’s an optimist’s wish for another twenty-five
years while we gradually take our places in the rocking chair
brigade and yack about the good old days when we could hide our

I'M afraid that I have nothing extraordinary to add to my last
reunion report. I continue to do much the same things that I did
then. I am still professor of art in Bowdoin College, chairman of
the department and director of the museum of art. I continue to
take an active interest in the life of my church —as a vestryman,
part-time member of the choir, etc. I’m married to the same fine
girl and attempt to help her rear our two children. Sharing their
activities, watching them grow up and change, and helping them
over some of the rougher spots is one of my major interests and
pleasures. Still blessed with good health, I join them at every
opportunity in sailing, tennis, swimming, skating, mountain climb-
ing and out-of-door life in general, though I’m informed that my
basketball eye and touch football legs now leave something to be
desired. During the summer we motor about a great deal in this
handsome part of the country, enjoying the scenery and visiting
friends when the kids are at camp. During the winter we are im-
mersed in the extremely busy life of the college and the surpris-
ingly active affairs of this small town. It is a kind of life which
seems to me rewarding and satisfactory in many ways, and one
which has contained few dull moments.
Such spare time as I could manage during the past ten years has
been devoted to the planning and writing of a book on the Lan-
guage of Art. It will be published this spring, and is my chief
contribution to my professional field to date. We have taken time
to read a great deal, listen to music on the record player, attend
a lot of concerts and lectures, and square dances at every oppor-
tunity. We also entertain the students in our home as frequently
as possible, and often sit far into the night with them talking about
all kinds of subjects and getting their views on the world, which,
to us, has been an endlessly interesting experience. All in all it has
been a gratifying life. If I were able to live it over again, I prob-
ally would do much as I have done, including attending Harvard
College and the University. The years spent there were among the
best of all.

JOHN ERWIN BEAUMONT

HOME ADDRESS: 308 Adams St., Milton, Mass.
OFFICE apprEss: Carlon Products Corp., 363 Highland Ave., Somerville 44,
ass.

BORN: April 6, 1910, Cleveland, Ohio. parents: John Erwin Beaumont, Grace
Forbes Allen.

PREPARED AT: University School, Cleveland, Ohio.

YEARS IN COLLEGE: 1929-1933. DEGREE: A.B., 1933.

MarRiED: Elizabeth Buffum, June 22, 1940, Cleveland, Ohio (divorced 1955).
CHILDREN: John Erwin, 3d, Feb. 3, 1942; Peter Whitney, Sept. 24, 1943.

OCCUPATION: General manager, Plastic Industrial Products Division, Carlon
Products Corporation.

THE first twenty years after college were smooth sailing for
me. Everything seemed to come my way. I was one of the for-
tunate ones to get a satisfactory job in 1933. And every few
years either a promotion or a better job came along. .

I started as a lowly but dignified employee of a bank in Cleve-
land. However, I soon learned that while there is plenty of
money in a bank there is very little sharing of the wealth with
lowly employees. Believing plastics to be a coming field, I tried
to get a job in it, but in those mid-1930 years was told politely
that while it was a growing field, there was no immediate need
for an economics major and wasn’t it too bad that I did not know
chemistry instead. I corrected this situation by studying chem-
istry nights at Western Reserve University in Cleveland and
a few years later presented myself ready, willing and able. En-
thusiastically I began work with the Bakelite Corporation in
New Jersey and stayed nearly ten years doing everything from
laboratory work to production supervision and, finally, sales.
It is a great company and I thoroughly enjoyed working with
it.

Meanwhile I married a Cleveland girl who was also a class-
mate of one of my sisters and discovered later that her grand-
father and mine had been good friends in the early days of Cleve-
land. We had two husky, happy boys who kept us very busy.
However, we managed to find time for skiing in New Hamp-
shire and an occasional trip to the West Indices, Puerto Rico,
Canada and the Middle East. We also always had some project
on the side that we did together. In my Twentieth Report I told

[ 67 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

about the farm in Ohio that we owned and operated long dis-
tance. It turned out successfully but not due to our farming
abilities. When land values went up so did our farm and we
sold, One day we decided that life would be more for both of
us if I stopped working for a big corporation and started a busj-
ness of my own. I located a plastic manufacturing business that
was sick and needed rejuvenating. I set out to rejuvenate it and
was soon the happy but over-worked small entrepreneur.

Through those first twenty years as I reflected occasionally
on the world and my place in it, I wondered if life were really
a “bowl of cherries” or if I was just plain lucky in not having
many trials to meet. We always seemed to have plenty of
everything, health, wealth and each other.

Suddenly, however, things became very different. Nearly
everything that I held fell away from me. My business, that we
started with high hopes, proved to be much sicker than we had
anticipated, and my efforts to save it finally failed. My wife
immediately broke up our marriage and married a former friend.
And with virtually all of my assets gone, for the first time I
knew what it was to look squarely into the eyes of the proverbial
wolf at the door. Only I did not even have a door to keep him
away.

These experiences abruptly changed the course of my life
and my thinking about life. When the foundations of one’s life
work are suddenly washed away due to no apparent mistake
on his part, a man has an opportunity, in fact, he is forced, to
re-evaluate what he is doing and the direction he is going. Taken
for granted values like faith, hope, charity, love and even life
itself take on new meaning. Even people are different because
you look at them differently. Little by little I am picking up
the broken pieces of what was formerly my life and am trying
to build a new different one.

Some people should not be in business for themselves but work
better as part of an organization team. Still, these are often the
very people who long most for that business of their own. Be-
lieving that I may be one of these, I am presently trying to satisfy
both desires by serving as general manager of the eastern plastics
plant of a big company but, as a side line, being the owner of

[68 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

a little plastics company doing auxiliary work for the main
company.

My two sons are now in prep school. The older, now a soph-
omore at New Preparatory School in Cambridge, will be a wel-
come addition to Harvard’s hockey team if our alma mater does
not unreasonably tighten its entrance requirements by the time
he is ready. My younger boy is at St. George’s in Newport;
Heaven only knows what Harvard will do to its requirements
when his age group knocks at the portals. Both boys are a joy
to their dad and already show promise of being not only better
athletes, but better students, than their dad.

My hobbies at the moment are intangible interests. I am inter-
ested in children anywhere, teenage boys in particular, and am
interested in such groups as Foster Parents, Big Brother, Boy
Scouts. Aly divorce prompted me to study other divorces, the
causes and the shattering effect on children. I was surprised to
find how little is being done to help people on the verge. Believ-
ing that divorce seldom settles anything and usually can be pre-
vented, I am part of a group of men and women that is trying
to do something about it.

My conclusion on this Twenty-fifth Anniversary is that life
is certainly not a “bowl of cherries.” It is not even “what you
make it.” Much is pure chance, Maybe there is even a divine
plan to the whole thing. It is possible that in retrospect at a
much later time I may consider these past very rough five years
the most valuable of my life. Who knows? Certainly several
milestones are behind me and I look forward to what is coming
with eagerness. Life is one big mystery and isn’t it fun trying
to solve it.

occUPATION: Engineer, Litton Industries; project engineer, Litton Inertial
Guidance Systems.

OFFICES HELD: Member and civilian technical consultant, working groups and
sub-panels on self-contained guidance and long-distance navigation,
Committee on Guided Missiles, Research and Development Board,
N.M.E., 1948-50; secretary and treasurer, Harvard Club of Southern
California, 1934-40.

MEMBER OF: Institute of Navigation; Harvard Club of Southern California.

PUBLICATIONS: Classified papers on Celestial Navigation and Pilotage of Air-
craft and Guided Missiles.

ENGINES of war have been my work, as an employee of sev-

eral purveyors of death to the national military establishment,

one after another: engineering on the powered flight control

system and other parts of the Lockheed “Constellation” airplane,

on the self-contained and automatic navigation system of the

Northrop “Snark” guided missile weapon, on the line-of-sight

collision system of the Hughes “Falcon” missile weapon, on the

North American aviation gyroscopic-seismic dead reckoner for
fighter aircraft, on the guidance system of the Martin “Bullpup”
missile weapon and on the Litton Inertial Navigation Equipments,
which fulfill various requirements of certain guided weapon
systems. These marvels have delighted me for the past eighteen
years. No one has been deliberately killed or injured by the
proper use of any of these, but making them has been in itself
a series of battles pitched at the marches of the “state of the
art,” of romantic adventures, of tempestuous dramas — nothing
dry-as-dust about it, altogether too hammy.

The splendid Constellation first flew in January, 1943, and the
thrill of presence at that flight is renewed whenever I seen one
of the five hundred now in service take off, incredibly, fifteen
years later — most aircraft are dead as the dodo in one-third that
interval. Snark’s guidance system was first test-flown in March,
1949, and I was along in the test airplance, an F 61-C “Black
Widow” night fighter, USAF 43-8357, now a museum piece.
The flight was a big “first” in the history of navigation. The
Navigation device represented the cunning (and morc!) of
scores of good men and true (and women!), but in the common

sense, the design of it was my invention, and it also fell to my

[ 70 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

lot to be the leader in the reduction to practice, and in realization
of the first equipments — and also in advocacy and defense of
the soundness of the system, against the attacks of our com-
petitors (who fell by the wayside at last, it seems), and expert
evaluators (who still flourish in their trade unabated). My two
years’ work on Falcon had no effect on that project, as far as
I know, though a great deal on me — it was a supreme intel-
lectual effort in geometry for me, and fate most handsomely
rewarded me in “a way — where no man sought” or could pre-
vent. I was system engineer on the N.A.A. Inertial Autonaviga-
tor for Fighter Aircraft, having technical charge of it during
its design, completion, testing and delivery (!) to the Air Force
—the first delivery of an autonavigator ever made by North
American Aviation —in 1955. Then my chance came to join
Litton Industries, and work in Beverly Hills (up from Burbank
and aircraft factories!) on inertial navigation equipments, as
such. We are in a competitive fire fight, and intend to win (no
bloodshed anticipated).

In these “first days of the new space age,” the public has been
let in on a lot of information, from which I gather that Snark’s
last competitor, “Navaho,” has gone to the happy hunting
grounds off Florida, formerly known as “the Snark infested
waters,” —from which Snark has simultaneously risen to the
tragically too-late status of “our only operational intercontinental
missile.” This sort of thing grows confusin’ when magnificent
Sputniks of foreign make begin to blaze across the twilight sky
from pole to pole, before the appraising eyes of the whole blessed
world, all apparently candidates for the Society for Diversion of
the War Effort to Extra-terrestrial Conquests.

The essentials of my background for this work were gained
at Harvard, and above all else in Professor Brinkmann’s “Math.
3.” He later became, for a time, a consultant on the Snark. The
path had been well marked. Over a century ago, the greatest
modern navigator, Thomas Hubbard Sumner, 1826, seems to have
had the type of this experience —but may I be spared his
ending!

I should have been taken in the World War II draft, had
not my number turned up a good half-way down the list. Con-
stellation was the military transport C-69, and accounted for

[71]

some deferment. I was on the verge of applying for a commis-
sion in the Marine Corps when my flying Marine brother, the first
Gordon, was killed in action at Guadalcanal, and I realized that
the thread of my line of the Bells had narrowed down to me
alone —I was 4A. The catastrophe was averted narrowly.

We have lived the past fifteen years at this same address in
the San Fernando Valley, guarded by a laughing collie,
“Princess,” but signs are that freeways and supermarkets will
get us on the move soon. We sally forth on more or less ex-
tended excursions from time to time, so far confined to the
Southwest — car-camping and back-packing in the Sierra Nevada,
White Mountains, Colorado Plateau, Baja California beaches. I
have accompanied my son to the lowest and highest points in
the area and all levels in between, with much huffing and puffing.
I make a business trip east now and then, and so have got to
know the Connecticut coast towns (like New Haven, ex the
Yale Bowl) and the Civil War battlefields (like Gettysburg). I
even spent a beautiful afternoon at Harvard last May, my first
time there since the Tercentenary. After twenty-one years, I was
a stranger everywhere except on the Weld Boat Club float, where
Blake, the coach of sculling, recognized me a hundred feet
away, bless him! Incidentally, I recognized Blake, too. Harvard
looked much the same to me, but my! how the trees had grown!

The Harvardian cognoscenti seem to be driving their families
around Europe and Rhode Island in VW Microbuses these days.
I advise safety belts all around. This car is nothing to fool with.
On my way to El Ciprés (my real home) alone in mine a little
over a year ago, I put on some hard left rudder and suddenly
found myself roaring up the Carretera Ensenada upside down
in a shower of sparks. Just about the time I figured out that
I was still among the living because my seat belt was latched
and there was a providential lull in traffic, the car snapped up
onto its three remaining wheels and started to roll over the road
edge downhill, but the one remaining mechanical brake held it.
I sent the ambulance back to Tijuana empty and walked away
from this one without physical effects, but 1 thought a lot in
that long three seconds,

De Poetica, my taste nowadays runs strongly to the works of
Luigi Pirandello, whose art has cleared after puzzling me for

[72]

a generation, and I owe some thanks for this to Mr. Eric Bent-
ley’s efforts. In Fine Art, for me, a few words from Perry Rath-
bone in Dunster House have germinated and flowered peren-
nially and increasingly, with the help of the Art Institute and
the National Gallery, which both lie near watering holes on
the dusty track between east and west. In politics and religion,
I adhere strongly to the faiths of my grandfathers, of course:
Chehalis, Topeka, prayer, goth ‘__memory, engine, an intel-
lect also.”

MANY things were dispensable in the economy of the United
States in the year 1933. Certainly newly-minted Harvard College
graduates fell into that category. Especially a graduate who did
not have even a hazy idea about (a) his working career objective
and (b) the first step toward obtaining it.

Thus conditioned, my educational process continued without
benefit of paid labor through the rest of 1933 and all of 1934. For
four months of 1934 I traveled in north Germany with Hans v.
Briesen, 2d, ’33, managing, believe it or not, to avoid practically
all contact with the Nazi horror then in its deceptive early stages.
Many parts of the land that we viewed were no closer spiritually
to Berlin than Kadoka, S.D., is to Washington, D.C.; so we could
be forgiven, I think, for not being as att courant politically as
Shirer and Kaltenborn soon got to be.

No travelogues, however, were sold from this adventure. Cir-

AFTER four years in the insurance business, I went to work
for the Gulf Oil Corporation as a trainee in 1937. Assignments
in sales, merchandising and service station acquisition eventually
led me to Portland, Maine, as district manager. Life was very
enjoyable there with sailing on Casco Bay, skiing in New Hamp-
shire and Maine and fishing on the Lakes. From Maine I was
recently transferred to Massachusetts as district manager for
the Northeast section, presently living in Marblehead, enjoying
the same kind of life as in Maine.

In 1939 I married Sally Stone of Springfield. Our prewar son,
Rick, is now at Governor Dummer Academy, doing well in
both studies and athletics. Our postwar daughter, Sue, is in the
fifth grade and enjoying her Turnabout sailing and skiing. A
joy to her old man.

1942 found me a navy officer on a slow boat to Africa — an
LST. This took me on a tour of duty in the Mediterranean,
France and England for four years. In review, I might close by

saying that I am a happy family man, assigned to the work I
like and the territory that offers the most to all of us.

I WAS one of several members of our Class whose father (Class
of ’08) had his Twenty-fifth when we graduated in June, 1933.
At that time, to be out of College twenty-five years seemed to
mean that one had lived to a ripe old age and life was about
finished. As we now approach our own Twenty-fifth, I am
happy to admit how wrong that point of view was and I hasten
to agree with the fellow who said “Life begins at forty” (or at
least a few years thereafter).

Since graduation in 1933, I have been engaged continuously
in one branch or another of the investment business. After ten
years in investment banking, I entered the investment manage-
ment field in 1943 with State Street Research & Management
Company, becoming a partner in 1946. At that time, our prin-
cipal business was managing State Street Investment Corporation,
a mutual investment company. However, in 1948, my partner,
Paul C. Cabot, was elected treasurer of Harvard and our firm
was retained by the University in an advisory capacity. In 1949,
I became deputy treasurer of Harvard and have enjoyed tremen-

[77 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

dously the contacts and associations with the University and its
affairs. Early in 1958 I was elected president of State Street In-
vestment Corporation, having served as vice-president since 1947.

The nature of the investment management field is such that
close relationships with many companies frequently develop
and we are often invited to participate in management as direc-
tors. Asa result, I am now serving as a director of three electric
utility companies, an oil company and a railroad. While these
relationships are interesting and sometimes quite rewarding in
one way or another, they are not without their problems at
times. For example, I would not recommend as a relaxing extra-
curricular activity involvement with such problems as the col-
lapse of the Schoellkopf hydro-electric plant at Niagara Falls
(Niagara Mohawk Power), the Dixon-Yates controversy (Middle
South Utilities), exploration of the mysteries of a turn-key con-
tract (Commonwealth Oil Refining) or trying to rebuild a rail-
road and make it run (M-K-T Railroad).

Civic and community activities have included serving a term
on the Hingham School Committee; membership on the Town
Finance Committee; treasurer and trustee of the Children’s Cen-
ter in Boston; director of the M.S.P.C.A.,, etc. I have been active
in the work of the South Shore Baptist Church of Hingham,
serving as chairman of the Building Committee which has just
completed a new Colonial Reproduction church. Politically, I
am still an active—and hopeful—member of the Republican
party.

Our family is growing up too rapidly—the boys are now
nineteen, sixteen and thirteen. Our recreational activities still
follow pretty closely the interests of the boys. I usually manage
to get in a fishing trip with the boys in the spring and a hunting
trip in the fall. We do some riding (have two horses) and I get
in a little golf in the summer and skiing in the winter (now using
4% ft. “goon” skis insead of the usual seven-footers). We are
an enthusiastic yachting family with the boys sailing in the Inter-
national “110” races and Helen and I doing quite a little cruising.
We have a part interest in a house in Bermuda, which is our first
love for a real vacation. We manage to get in a little time there
each spring (with the boys) and again in the fall (alone). If
I could spend more time in Bermuda and less in the every day

\{Y first acquaintance with a twenty-fifth reunion class was at a
yaseball game in which I acted as usher to the Class of 1907 or
hereabouts. This group of distinguished old gentlemen sang vo-
iferously throughout the fray that “Virgin sturgeon need no
rgin!” At that time I marveled at the durability, as well as
mngevity of Harvard men. The time approaches when I shall no
oubt again be astounded at the age of the men in a twenty-fifth
-union class. Myself, Iam prematurely gray, with a rather pleas-
ily. rounded waist which is expected of a man just edging past
5 prime.
I was one of those unfortunate people who lived too close to
arvard, close enough so that it seemed only natural to live at
me and come and go by way of the Park Street subway. It was
t until a long while later that I realized I had been very far away
m Harvard, that I knew only too little of Harvard life or what
rvard stands for. It has, in fact, been a gratifying surprise to
to find that Harvard has not been swamped by the current

ism.

a secondary wave of the recession left me high and dry for a
while. In 1938 I joined the U.S. Geological Survey and have been
with them ever since. When one becomes a government engineer,
one automatically is eliminated from the potential list of million-
dollar contributors to Harvard funds. But there are many com-
pensations, among them the satisfying knowledge that one’s daily
work is not alone to increase one’s personal well-being, but is
doing some good toward the well-being of a large number of
people.

My own particular work in the Water Resources Division of
the Geological Survey has been concerned with collecting data
on the availability of water in the rivers of this country. These
data are needed in part in order that we may be furnished with
water to drink, for water-power purposes, for industrial use,
irrigation, etc. In recent years, 1 have come to specialize in the
measurement and the prediction of floods and at present I am
engaged purely in research on flood frequencies. My work has
taken me to various parts of the country. We have lived in Boston,
Indianapolis and now in Washington. I have also spent periods
up to a few months in Bismarck, Topeka, Hartford and San Fran-
cisco, each time following large floods in those areas. I have also
visited most of the States in this country in the course of my work.

About six years ago, my wife Charlotte decided to join me in
government service and has been a career woman, first with the
Fish and Wildlife Service and now with the Bureau of Indian
Affairs.

As for hobbies, | still play the violin and have been connected
with some amateur symphony orchestra in every place we have
lived. I enjoy reading, including whodunits, science-fiction, math-
ematics and statistics. I love gardening and bowl for exercise
outside of the growing season. Bridge and poker are also hobbies
of a sort. Our favorite vacation spot is Florida, and we have in
mind retiring there some day, perhaps somewhere about half-way
down the east coast. That, I hope, will come some while before
the Fiftieth Reunion.

UPON graduation was unable to find a job so went to law school.
Attended University of Pennsylvania Law School and graduated
in 1936. Instead of immediately taking bar examinations, I went
to Tahiti for several months. Although this was unorthodox it
was fun until I was sent for and summoned home to take up a
more conservative existence.

Was employed by the Philadelphia law firm of Pepper, Bodine,
Stokes & Schoch in March of 1937 and, except for a five-year tour
with the U.S. Navy during World War II, have been with that
firm ever since. Am now a partner and the firm name is Pepper,
Bodine, Frick, Scheetz & Hamilton. In January, 1939, I married
Mary C. Pew. We have two children, Ginger and Peppi, seven-
teen and sixteen. We have lived in Ardmore, Pennsylvania or
nearby since marriage.

Right after Pearl Harbor, like most of our class, I went on active
duty with the Navy. Early in 1942 I became executive officer of
the U.S.S. Flicker, a mine sweeper operating out of Norfolk,
Virginia. In the fall of 1942 I went to the Submarine Chaser
Training Center in Miami. From there I] matriculated to become
commanding officer of the S.C. 678, which was to patrol the pleas-
ant Isle of Bermuda. In 1943 I became executive officer of the
Edward H. Allen (D.E. 531). In December of 1944, I became
commanding officer of the U.S.S. Wantuck (A.P.D. 125), the

former ship was in the Atlantic; the latter did duty in the Pacific,

My sport interests are golf, which I play on weekends: in the
summer; and fox hunting, which I enjoy on Saturdays in the fall
and winter. As to business interests, I am a director of Seatrain
Lines, Inc., Warrior Petroleum Company, Mustang Drilling Com-
pany, Black Manufacturing Company, Alexander Milburn, Inc.
and Squaw Valley Lodge, the latter being the site of the 1960
Winter Olympics.

Twenty-five years is a long time and we will be dead longer
so it might be well for all of us at this point to enjoy life more.
With this in mind, I hope soon (December, 1957) to take a trip
around the world. Also I have acquired a race horse. The last

twenty-five years were O.K. and I look forward to the next
twenty-five.

AFTER leaving Harvard somewhat ahead of most of the Class
in the darkest “Of depression years, I obtained shelter with the

[ 83 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

Reconstruction Finance Corporation, that much maligned gov-
ernmental agency, born of Republican parents and forced-
fed into rapid maturity by the Democrats. Most of the time
was spent in Boston, but eventually I wound up in Washington
as assistant to the RFC administrator.

During the war years I did time in Uncle Sam’s Infantry, first
of all with the Third Infantry Regiment. Whom should I find
in the same platoon but Rowland “Robinson, also of 733. We'll
wager that we were the only two Harvard men together in the
same Infantry platoon in the whole Army. After struggling
through OCS at the ripe old age of thirty-five, I joined the 8ist
Division and shortly, principally because of lack of other can-
didates, became regimental adjutant. When I finally accumulated
enough points for a discharge I was S-1 of Headquarters Com-
mandant Section of GHQ at Tokyo.

Back to the RFC after the war and then in 1953, shortly before
the RFC was ordered liquidated by the same party which had
originally spawned it nearly a generation before, I joined the
firm with which I am now associated. Incidentally, my wife's
mink stole was acquired several years after my leaving the RFC.
This has been the subject of much kidding, as also has my being
married to a girl named Polly Bergen —the singing voices are
not the same!

Life has now become devoted to two main efforts — that of
keeping my weight under two hundred and my golf score under
one hundred — in neither of which am I having too much success.

EACH attempt to get this opus underway has met with over-
whelming obstacles, e.g. an unfinished newspaper, a IV detective
thriller. As with many’ others, I have just found it difficult to
“finalize” the passing of twenty-five years. However. . .

Following graduation, decided to remain at Harvard and work
for a Ph.D. in sociology. Finances were very much of a problem,
and I did graduate work on a half-time basis, meanwhile holding
down important posts as ice cream and soda “dispenser” at How-
ard Johnson’s, clerk at the delivery desk at Widener and assistant
in sociology.

During my graduate years, I persuaded Ethel Goldberg, Rad-
cliffe 732, that life might not always be a matter of counting
pennies. We were married m 1935. My prediction was more
accurate than I had anticipated. Shortly after marriage she ob-
tained a post as a social worker that enabled both of us to live
in relative comfort for those times.

In 1937, having completed my residence requirements and a
preliminary draft of my doctoral dissertation, I accepted a re-
search fellowship at Columbia. However, at the last minute, ill-
ness in the family prevented our leaving Boston. I took a post
with the W.P.A. which involved launching an experimental
program in Boston to provide testing, vocational guidance and
training for youngsters of the National Youth Administration.
The program prospered and when the spring of 1938 was at
hand, we had to make a crucial decision. I had been offered a
teaching post at Sweet Briar College, Virginia, and simultaneously
the N.Y.A. asked me to extend. my program throughout the

[ 85 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

state of Massachusetts. The opportunity of correcting the evils
of the world (remember?) won handily over the envisioned
charm and languor of Swect Briar. For the next five years I re-
mained with the N.Y.A. helping to extend the guidance and
training program throughout New England and New York and
later becoming regional director of research and statistics for
the same agency.

My next post was as educational director with the New Eng-
land Office of the Anti-Defamation League. I later became direc-
tor and was then promoted to the directorship of the Midwest
Regional Office. Once again I found myself engaged in work
which contained a high degree of job satisfaction. Whereas the
N.Y.A. had provided satisfactions in helping individual young-
sters get a decent start in life, the A.D.L. work, ranging from
educational and public relations programs to work with the police,
offered an opportunity to strengthen our democracy pattern.

The announcement of the creation of Brandeis University ex-
cited me as it must have every Jew identified with education.
Thus, when Dr. Abram L. Sachar discussed a post with me in
1948, there was little question in my mind. Even though I
found myself director of public relations, work I had never
done before, it was the opportunity to participate in a new and
challenging venture, Successively, I have held the posts of
director of public affairs, executive assistant to the president and,
presently, dean of university administration. The experience
has been fulfilling and exciting. It permitted me to return to
the academic world proper, to join in a pioneering venture and
to play a major role in the growth of an institution which has
already acquired a fair degree of distinction and prestige in the
world of higher education.

Michael, born in 1943, and Ellen, 1946, have been emerging
as amazingly normal children for which we are thankful. Mich-
acl, presently, is the most important figure at Meadowbrook Jr.
High School in Newton (source: Michacl Berger), immersed
in sports and peeking into a new world inhabited by females.
Ellen recently made a crucial decision destined to influence the
cultural development of the nation. She has decided to become
an actress rather than a writer and js working diligently toward
her objective. Ethel has held a series of social work posts with

several years has been serving as a member of the faculty of

We are busy, blessed with fine children, health, interesting
vork, an appreciation of life, and a debt that is growing at a
eadily decreasing rate. If twenty-five years had to pass, they
ould hardly have been more interesting and fulfilling.

Michigan, I was assigned to the Judge Advocate General's
Office, Washington, D.C., where I “fought the war” until m
relief from active duty as major in June, 1946. The bright spot
of the war period, insofar as I was concerned, was my marriage
on May 12, 1943, to Mary Delia Sliney of Columbus, Ohio. Upon
release from the Army, I remained in Washington as an attorney
in the Legislative Office of the Veterans Administration. At
this period of demobilization, General Omar H. Bradley, then
Administrator of Veterans Affairs, was expanding the VA to
assist the readjustment of veterans to civil life. My work, which
kept me in close touch with the Congress, proved interesting
and to my liking. Also, it gave me the opportunity to remain
with friends from the Army who likewise decided to settle in
Washington, either with VA or at other pursuits. As a result,
I have remained in the legislative field. Through promotions,
I have progressed to the position of director of Legislative Serv-
ice in the VA.

Most of Mary’s and my spare time is devoted to Nancy and
Howie, each of whom is at an age which keeps us on our toes
—mentally, physically, and socially. It’s a far cry from the
carefree years following graduation — golf, bridge, travel and

all that goes with few responsibilities — but give us the family
life.

IN attempting to review my accomplishments over the twenty-
five years, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that in spite of
having a very full and happy life I cannot boast of any outstand-
ing achievements.

After graduating from Harvard in the Class of 1933, spending
one year at Trinity College, Cambridge, England, to broaden my
education, and two more years at the Harvard Business School, I
joined the Eagle Pencil Company which has been in my family
since its inception and of which I am the fifth generation. Eagle
has world-wide sales, several plants in this country and abroad,
and is affiliated with a number of other related companies. Having
grown up in the business and now being an officer and director of
these various enterprises, naturally affords me the opportunity to
travel rather extensively in the U.S.A., Canada, Latin and South
America and Europe. Perhaps the most important step that Eagle
has undertaken in the past twenty-five years and for which I am
intimately responsible is to move its principal manufacturing and
administrative functions from New York City, where it has been
for the past eighty years, to Danbury, Connecticut. By the end
of 1958 Eagle’s new, large, one-story plant should be in operation,
fully comparable to the finest of modern installations, and open to
inspection by all interested members of the Harvard Class of 1933.

From 1942 to 1945, having obtained a leave of absence from
Eagle, I was commissioned a first lieutenant in the Ordnance De-
partment of the U.S. Army and served in Washington, Aberdeen
and at the Frankford Arsenal in Philadelphia.

On September 1, 1945, I married Suzanne Wilding of Scarsdale,
New York, and now have a lovely home in Bedford Hills, New
York, with my charming wife and two fascinating daughters,
Wendy Ellen, aged nine, and Jennifer Robin, aged six. These three
ladies keep me on the qui vive.

[ 89 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

I still retain my interest in fishing, as exampled by my member.
ship in the Anglers Club of New Y York, and the Windbeam Club,
shooting w hich I largely do on my mother’s plantation in South
Carolina, tennis and above all, horseback riding. Although I had
always loved horses, I had never taken the sport seriously until
after my marriage. My wife, having been an ardent horsewoman
all her life, really sold me a bill of goods. Now she has got the
bear by the tail. We keep our horses at home where our children
are learning to ride and show. We foxhunt with the Golden
Bridge Hounds which are nearby, with the Millbrook Hunt and
frequently go on hunting trips to Pennsylvania, Maryland, Vur-

ginia and the Carolinas. The old game of golf which used to
absorb me so much in my youth has practically been forgotten
except for an annual or bi-annual poor attempt.

My business, my family and my love of the outdoors keep me
busy and happy. I am a Republican but I have had little time nor
inclination for politics, unfortunately not enough for the arts and
only a limited time for charity. But I have worked among others
for the Hemophilia Foundation, the A.S.P.C.A., and the Northern
Westchester Hospital. My church affiliation is Protestant Episco-
pal and I am a member of St. Matthews Church in Bedford Hills.

From time to time I see some of the classmates, some more
frequently than others: John Campbell, Dick Wells, Pat Coburn,
Dick Riley, Steve Stackpole, Ham Young, Bob Bates, Stu Scott,
Carl Hageman, Maurice Powell, Perry Brayton, amongst others,
cross my path at the Harvard Club of New York or elsewhere.

As I look back over the years, I have no regrets and only wish
I could have accomplished more. The broad education and men-
tal training received at Harvard, I feel, were invaluable in keeping
an open and flexible mind to meet the complicated and ever-
changing problems of modern American life.

whence the name. Here I soon learned the meaning of work and
gradually I discarded not a few long-charished theories about life
in general and child-rearing in particular.

In the summer of 1934 I was married; in 1936 our first son was
born; and then in 1937 my father died and I was elected head-

2§TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

AFTER I failed to graduate from Boston Latin (but was some-
how admitted to Harvard nonetheless), I went on to fail to
graduate from Harvard. Over the years, I achieved that same spe-
cial relationship with several other reasonably distinguished under-
graduate and graduate institutions. One after another — in Boston,
in Providence, in Cambridge again, in New York — they treated
my intermittent, part-time efforts with amazing tolerance. A
couple of them even permitted me to do a bit of research and
teaching despite my deplorable lack of the formal prerequisites,
(Once, many years ago, in a self-conscious moment, I nearly
brought myself to the poimt of picking up a doctorate from a
mail-order diploma mill. At the last moment, however, I re-
verted to character.)

During all that time, I was also engaged in a succession of one
and two-year business or professional relationships a whole
series of Depression-haunted enterprises: in advertising, in news-
paper work, in sales promotion, in directory and trade-paper pub-
lishing. Finally, I went into business for myself, developing a
marketing research service and, eventually, a somewhat more
professional practice as a consulting economist. At its peak, I
had offices in Boston, New York and Mexico City, and was finally
on the verge of making a bit of money, but I found myself
constantly and inevitably drawn to the least profitable area my
work touched—the book publishing industry — and increas-
ingly irritated or bored with the more “commercial” areas.

A long illness (from a stubborn Mexican bug) and the war (to
which my contribution was a trivial civilian one) pretty much
shut me down. When the war was over, I stopped bucking
myself. Natalie and I bought a bookshop in Greenwich Village
and settled down to four interesting years of long hours, no
riches, but lots of other rewards. The bookshop led in the end
to publishing and the last seven years have found me working
seventy or eighty hours a week at a variety of stimulating and
often extremely satisfying chores in almost every branch of the
trade book and textbook fields. Here, all the miscellaneous bits
of lore or skill picked up in the earlier years finally found some
place; and I’m probably doomed to work with books for what
time remains,

Publishing and book distribution are not “big business”; as an

[95]

industry it is notoriously backward, anachronistic. It isn’t one
of the “big money” ficlds. But there are other compensations,
of course, in any socially useful work that offers constant intel-
lectual stimulus. Naturally, we miss the overseas vacations and
the luxuries and the “security for our old age” —I just haven’t
been smart enough to find my own perfect combination of
leasant, useful career and top- ‘level financial reward. But we
go on cheerfully.

Family: Since she left the theater, Natalie has kept busy, first
with the bookshop and more recently with part time teaching
of adults. (Her unlikely pair of subjects is ceramics and Spanish
conversation.) Marjorie is now a liberal arts freshman at Boston
University, busy with Drama Society roles and all the rest. She’s
fun, but shows no more practical sense than her father: her idea
of a career is creative writing — although she hopes to combine
that with a houseful of babies.

Hobbies: Who has time or energy? Never either an athlete
or a do-it-myself guy, I haven’t felt a conscious need for the
standard sports or hobbies. Later, maybe.

Community and such: Until I moved to New York, I did a little
joining. I was, for five years or so, a board member of the Com-
munity Church of Boston and, for a while, of the Massachusetts
Civil Liberties Committee. Nowadays, except for a few of the
usual trade or professional associations, 1 seem to have no time
for (and, I must confess, no really burning interest in) organiza-
tions or “causes.” Part of this is due, I suppose, to living in Man-
hattan; here one can without even trying be lost in a world of
one’s own work and family to a degree less likely in smaller
communities. Again, maybe later.

Political and related areas: I’m still a “liberal” —a term I’d
hate to try to define. In any event, I usually vote Democratic:
I’m all for more and better schoolhouses and for higher salaries
for teachers, for lots of the right kind of aid and cooperation
around the globe, etc.; I don’t have much use for censorship of
any kind and I don’t mind a little nonconformity, especially
in ideas.

SINCE leaving Cambridge, I have lived mostly in Pelham Manor,
New York, and Washington. I have had three jobs including my
present one, plus three months in the U.S. Army Air Force, most
of it spent in the hospital on Governor’s Island, in the summer of
1942. 1 have had a duodenal ulcer (which nearly killed me in 1945)
and four operations. Smoking and drinking are things of the past,
as far as I am concerned. (Doctor’s orders.) Since March, 1941,

I have been with the Interior Department in the Personnel Divi-
sion and am at present assisting in the training program in the
Branch of Training, Division of Personnel Management, Office of
the Secretary. Government employees are not supposed to have
“political convictions” but I think I would be safe in saying that
whoever gets elected, from now on things are going to be more
and more expensive.

JULIUS CAESAR is supposed to have said, “I grow older, w hile

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

ment applies well to those of us who entered the field of school-
teaching immediately upon graduation, and have gladly taught for
a quarter of acentury. At first, all boys entering Exeter had been
born within the same decade as I; but soon their birth dates came
in the 1920's; then even sooner, it seems, in the ’30’s; and now un-
believably in the *4o’s. If all this keeps up, I shall be graduated
permanently from Exeter, with my fiftieth reunion class in 1979.

So intimate an association with a school has resulted, perhaps
inevitably, in a less intimate association than many of you have
had with our college. I probably hear more about Harvard and
do less about it than most of you, certainly less than I should. As
director of scholarship boys at Exeter since 1945, I have been
privileged to travel perhaps a quarter of a million miles, in search
of students for Exeter whom John Phillips, Exeter founder, char-
acterized as “poor children of promising genius,” and whom we
describe as “long on brains and short on cash.”

While I was spending so much time away from home, our son
Jack apparently set out to prove beyond a doubt that sons of
Harvard men are taller than their fathers. Last spring he rowed
on an Exeter crew, thirty years after I coxed such a crew. His
dimensions — height six feet, weight 160 pounds; mine of 1927,
height five feet, weight 100 pounds. Jack, now a senior, has
chosen Princeton for his college, and we hope that by Reunion
time Princeton will have chosen him.

Nancy, soon to be sixteen, has achieved this year a lifelong am-
bition by being admitted to the Northfield School for Girls, as a
member of the eleventh grade. The excitement of Northfield is
still too warm for her to make up her mind about college; but she
seems to favor Wellesley, the alma mater of a great-aunt, a grand-
mother and an aunt, over Skidmore, her mother’s college.

Sally has been much more faithful in attending her college re-
unions than I have been. Last spring she had her twenty-fifth
reunion (no husbands, children or dogs allowed), she being
younger but brighter than I. She and I have been able to take some
trips together and hope to do more traveling together now that
Jack and Nancy will no longer be at home. Our most memorable
family excursion consisted of a motor trip through many of the
western national parks during the summer of 1955.

In earlier reports 1 have mentioned how pleasant it has been to

[ 98 ]

encounter Harvard classmates all over the country and, more
recently, to find sons of Harvard classmates in the Exeter student

body. I look forward to the continuation of these pleasures up
until the day of retirement.

where I ran the Program for Belgium and Luxembourg. These
refugees consisted mainly of escapees from behind the Curtain,

Last year I came home with the full intention of accepting
a rather interesting assignment with the United Nations. How-
ever, the Foreign Service won out as far as my decision was
concerned, in spite of the fact that the former assignment would
have been Rome! I find Bolivia fascinating, and my job (eco-
nomic attaché) is absorbing. The new government has unprece-
dented stability and the president is rigidly pro-American. A
stabilization program, which was initiated in December, 1956,
is working out for the best of the country, in spite of difficulties
which at times appeared insurmountable. The climate is de-
lectable (altitude apparently affects me favorably). I play tennis
once or twice a week, go horseback-riding, and drive a “Thun-
derbird” over the few roads available. Although it will be impos-
sible for me to attend my Reunion, I shall be there in spirit; ac-
tually I am a renegade from the Class of ’34 and, if I am around,
will “crash” their 25th. I am hoping to get a glimpse of my
daughter this Christmas, as well as my son, who is ’59, Eliot.
I am a little peaked at his choice (I was Dunster) and I know

that the thing that eliminated Dunster was the distance from the
Yard!

AFTER graduation from college in 1933, I tried to get started
at banking in New York Ciry, an effort thwarted by the depres-
sion, In September, 1935, I returned to school, this time to stud
law. Upon graduation from the Law School in 1938 I completed
my New Jersey law clerkship with my present firm, took the
attorney's examinations and was admitted to the New Jersey
dar in April, 1939. I continued with my present firm as an asso-
ciate through 1946 with three years and eight months’ time out
for military service during World War IL.

In October, 1945, during terminal leave, I married Jean. The
twins came along in November, 1947, and Penny three and one-
half years later. Since I was one of a family of three boys, it
came as somewhat of a surprise that girls, especially small ones,
appear to be quite as active, resourceful and even on occasions as
mischievous as boys. Tam, of course, delighted with my family
and only wish that the work of a country practitioner would al-
low me more time with them.

After more examinations in the fall of 1946, I became a coun-
sellor-at-law and in January, 1947, was admitted to partnership
in my present firm. Recently I have tended to concentrate more
or less in the municipal, probate and equity fields of law.

FOR practically all the time since school I’ve been involved with

[ 103 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

the movies, in one way or another. After graduation I went to
work for the Skouras Theatres on Long Island as an apprentice
assistant manager — which is show business for doorman-in-a-
blue-suit. About a year later, [came to Los Angeles and got a job
at Loew’s State Theatre — but this time there was no blue suit,
I was an authentic doorman. The work was dull — standing at
attention, looking alert, or at least awake, and remembering to
say “Stairway to the left for the best available seats... .” The
only comfort I had during those days was thinking of the jobs
I might have had if I hadn’t been a Harvard graduate. After
four months of standing and staring into spaces of Loew’s
State’s lobby, I became a reader in the Universal Studio Story De-
partment. Following those months of standing and staring, it was
a joy to be sitting and reading. A year and a half later, 1 became
story editor, But in 1938, the company was sold, management
changed and I was, at twenty-five, a retired executive.

I was out of a job long enough to get a solid rest, a deep sun-
tan and a belly-full of being out of a job. Eventually, I went to
work as head of the Story Department of the Music Corporation
of America, a large talent agency. Less than a year later, I left to
join Paramount’s Story Department as assistant editor and was
Jater made head of the department.

In August of 1941, I went into the Army —as a first lieutenant
in the Signal Corps at Fort Monmouth. Our organization be-
came the Signal Corps Photographic Center at Astoria, Long
Island. I was stationed there (along with Dan Taradash and
Bernie Feins, Class of 33) for the rest of the war, making pic-
tures for several branches of the Army, |

Back in Hollywood, I went to work for David Selznick. By
this time, I’d decided I'd like to become a producer. I’d learned
a great deal in my army work about the technical side of pictures,
and my story experience had taught me a Jot about the creative
aspect. I was ready to be a producer. So, Selznick made me head
of his Story Department — but with a promise to let me produce
“after a while.” There was no chance to find out whether or
not the promise would ever have been fulfilled, for after I’d
been with Selznick two years his company was becoming inactive.

But the notion of my producing was still active. | bought the
screen rights to Elliott Arnold’s novel, Blood Brother, and had

[ 104]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

a screenplay prepared. James Stewart read the script, liked it,
and agreed to do it. We made a deal to make the picture for
zoth Century-Fox, where I also signed a contract as producer.
Blood Brother was released as “Broken Arrow,” the first of
many pictures I made for zoth. Among the others were “Mr.
880,” “Take Care of My Little Girl,” “Don’t Bother To Knock”
(screenplay by Dan Taradash), “The Day The Earth Stood
Sull,” “Desiree” (screenplay by Dan ‘Taradash), and “The
Racers.”

In 1955, I left 2oth to form an independent production com-
pany with the aforementioned Dan aradash. We call our
company The Phoenix Corporation, and we release through Co-
lumbia. Phoenix’s first picture was “Storm Center,” starring Bet-
te Davis. I’ve just completed “Cowboy” based on Frank Harris’s
My Reminiscences As A Cowboy and starring Glenn Ford and
Jack Lemmon (Class of ’47). We're getting ready to start the
next Phoenix picture, “Bell, Book And Candle” in January. This
one will star Kim Novak and, again, James Stewart. If there’s a
delay in starting it had better be short enough to allow us to finish
by June, because that’s when Phoenix is going to Cambridge. Dan
and I promised each other nothing would interfere with our be-
ing at the Reunion, so we’re just going to close the store.

DIRECTLY from Harvard I plunged into medical school at
{ 106 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

Boston University. Plunged is the word, very emphatically. The

only time college got serious was the last few days before exams;

at medical school every day was that way. To commit the facts,

millions of them, fascinating though they were, from book to

memory required a very patient posterior. Postgraduate train-

ing in various hospitals, though arduous physically, was quite
leasant.

Then, World War II took up the next five and a half years of
which four and a half were spent overseas in the European Thea-
tre. Because I was assigned to hospitals throughout, I had no
opportunity to be either a hero or a coward. The year 1946 was
spent working in a VA hospital in West Roxbury, Massachu-
setts. It was here that I met a young surgeon, Bob Thomson,
Class of ’34, who later was to become my brother-in-law. Shortly
after following him to Fitchburg, Massachusetts, to practise inter-
nal medicine, I met his sister, Nora. We had a boy in less than
one year after marriage but have had no further luck that way
since, although eight years have passed.

I am sure that this book contains the accounts of several phy-
sicians because a large number of men in our class went into
medicine. Like them, so much time was taken up with long
hours of work and trying to keep abreast of the enormous amount
of investigation and progress being made that there are very few
hours left for family and non-medical reading such as ordinary
newspapers and magazines. Thus, by way of hobbies, it would
seem that I must admit that my hobby consists of trying to catch
time to do chores around my grounds and home or to read some-
thing not absolutely necessary in my work. Over the last four
or five years, we got away twice a year for about two weeks each
time which has done wonders in helping us maintain our equilib-
rium. .

Harvard-wise over the last twenty-five years, I was quite in-
active. As I recall, attending a few football games and subscrib-
ing regularly to the Alusni Bulletin was the extent of my activ-
ity. I attended no reunions. The reason for this is quite obvious
to me. Back in the college days I commuted between home and
school, being a local boy. This was a financial necessity. Con-
sequently, I existed at the periphery of things rather than in the
midst of them. Let’s see if the Twenty-fifth changes things.

I FOUND, upon leaving Harvard, that the four years behind
me were truly golden; they have remained the most living and
large single memory of happiness that I have collected. In them
I was admirably equipped (or rather admirably equipped my-
self) for applied hedonism, gourmetism, leisure, liberty and loaf-
ing. I found myself, at their conclusion, wholly unprepared for
sacrifice, disappointment, hard work, mediocrity. The adjust-
ment to medical school hence was difficult. Yet looking back :
now, I believe it was the very core of the values that made
hedonism and its congeners come so easily, which sustained me
through the tougher realities of later years. It has been these
values which have let me find some meaning for vicissitude and
these values that have permitted the fullest measure of satisfac-
tion when happiness has been vouchsafed.

In my medical life span to date I have been a Harvard man for
all but two years: 1941-1943. In these two years I was at New
York University College of Medicine on a fellowship, doing
research in circulatory physiology, and associated with three
of the finest minds and personalities 1 have every known: Homer
Smith, Dickinson Richards and André Cournand. The latter
two are now Nobel Laureates, For the rest: my internship and
residency were on the Harvard Services and in the Thorndike

[ 108 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

Laboratory of the Boston City Hospital. These all completed,
I entered into practice as an internist and cardiologist and simul-
taneously began an uninterrupted association with Harvard
Medical School as a teacher, ranking now as Clinical Associate
in Medicine. .

Some very grim things have come my way since 1933. As-
sorted ill-health lost me a year of Medical School, nearly a year
of internship and a period of residency. A brief bout with active
tuberculosis kept me out of military service; in fact the diagnosis
was established on Pearl Harbor Day. I lost both my parents
under more than customarily grievous circumstances and they
both meant inordinately much to me. Shortly after this began
a protracted illness of my young wife and of my young brother,
both of whom died within days of one another. Caring for my
mother, my wife, my brother and a newborn son for nearly
three years with no help from another human being and keeping
up a busy schedule of practice and teaching, was an arduous
assignment.

Some wonderful things have also came my way since 1933.
While I had them I enjoyed my kinfolk on a mature level, with
an active mutual affection apparently granted to few. Par-
ticularly I got to know my dad who was a doctor, albeit a Yale
man! I have had the privilege of teaching third-year medical
students for a number of years, as well as making ward rounds
at the City. This has been a continuously enriching, educational
and humbling experience with the finest of young minds. I have
been associated with many fine chiefs, who have given me superb
medical opportunities. George Minot of the Thorndike gave
me my early appointments and got me the job of summer phy-
sician on the island of North Haven, Maine, that taught me the
practice of medicine and taught me much of my fellow-man.
William B. Castle, his successor, has been not only a staunch
friend in the direst of need, but the inspiration (as he has been
to countless men) to adhere to the highest of professional stand-
ards, I learned to ski (more or less) in 1941 and this sport has
become one of the dominant forces in my subsequent life. It
has regulated my entire social existence, occupied major areas
of non-professional fantasy and has brought recurrent satisfac-
tion, surcease, health, exuberance and pure joy. Any ski dev-

otce reading this will know what I mean. I bought a house in
New Hampshire, near the Eastern Slope ski areas. Apart from
all Freudian symbolism, it has meant much to me and my family
and friends, in fulfillment of our skiing pleasures. A Harvard
1933 visitor will always be welcome. I married a wonderful
girl, who made our few years together the most intensely happy
ones I have ever known. She taught me that perfection of livin
is attainable, and that it must be created, not found. We had —
and I still have — a home we both loved. I find much satisfaction
keeping the place in order: painting, carpentering, interior deco-
rating. And I] have become a most absorbed and enthusiastic
gardener. Lastly, 1 have a three-year-old boy, named Richard
Brooks. He happens to be the handsomest, sunniest, most mas-
culine guy that ever owned a father. He is upstairs right now
taking a nap, under threat of confiscation of all the loot that
Santa left. My knowing that he is up there is undoubtedly the
only reason that has made me certain there is any point in writ-
ing all this. :

ON leaving college, I started out in the family textile business
in the early phases of the last depression, and found myself par-
ticipating in the liquidation of the same in 1938. My next business
venture, as with many other classmates, was interrupted by World
War II. Having taken ROTC in college, I was commissioned
an ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve on graduation, but in 1933
the prospect of ever using this training looked remote. How-
ever, a communication from the Bureau of Naval Personnel in
August, 1941, corrected this impression rather promptly, and
there ensued a period of service that I would not swap for any
other equivalent period of my life. In my opinion the greatest
advantage of my ensign’s commission was that it gave me the op-
portunity to go afloat early in the war. It was a gratifying ex-
perience to serve a large national cause that submerged personal

[ 112]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

interest and desires. First, I served on the battleship New York,
doing convoy duty in the North Atlantic, and then participated
in the invasion of North Africa. Upon returning to the States in
February, 1943, after a brief training period, I took command of
a brand new LST and headed for the Mediterranean. Our ship
delivered both assault troops, tanks and vehicles at H-Hour in
southern Sicily. Anyone who stays with the amphibious force
long enough will finally smell gunsmoke, and we certainly did in
the Mediterranean. My first command was not long, but was ex-
citing, and our LST never returned home to rot in a navy yard.
Her rusted hull has been either salvaged by the Italians, or broken
up by the waves of the north coast of Sicily. We managed to
be in the right place at the wrong time when German fighter
bombers took us out of action in the final stages of this campaign.
The time was August, 1943, and we were landing troops behind
Jerry’s lines. After this rather hectic command, I was fortunate
to be assigned to the amphibious planning staff of Admiral Kin-
caid, Naval Commander of the Seventh Fleet in the southwestern
Pacific. In Australia, we helped to plan the island hopping through
New Guinea that finally returned MacArthur to the Philippines.

I was mustered out of the Navy shortly after V-J Day as a full
commander. My job in the wool business awaited me, but there
was a doubt in my mind whether an early interest in wildlife and
the conservation of natural resources should continue to be
side-tracked. As a result, I made the break and joined the staff
of the National Audubon Society in New York for a year, and
subsequently went to the National Wildlife Federation in Wash-
ington, D.C., where I later became executive director of this
organization. About this time in 1949, I decided to expand my
avocational motion picture activities into a full-time business.
The advent of television opened new areas for wildlife photog-
raphy, and with more enthusiasm than technical knowledge, I
embarked on the project of producing 30 fifteen-minute tele-
vision shows under the series title, “Wonders of the Wild.”
Somewhat to my surprise, this series sold well enough to keep
the infant company, Borden Productions, Inc., going until I could
expand into other fields.

One of the more interesting of these has been a cordial rela-
tionship with Walt Disney Studios in Hollywood. I filmed, at

[ 113]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

their request, a portion of their Academy Award winning “Van-
ishing Prairie”; my efforts being primarily concerned with
waterfowl in the Canadian Prairies. The Disney boys seemed to
like the quality of my photography well enough so that in
1955 I spent five weeks on Midway Island in the middle of the
Pacific Ocean photographing gooney birds for them. Recent
Disney productions in which I have participated are his tele-
vision films on the life of John James Audubon, and his True
Life Adventure film “Islands of the Sea.”

As a result of my wildlife photography, in 1951 I was invited
to Fenway Park in Boston to appear on television between the
halves of a Red Sox doubleheader. I showed some duck films
taken with the camera gun which I invented. With the tool of my
trade in hand, I photographed some of the ensuing game with
quite exciting results. After following birds in flight, following
a baseball was much more predictable. The resulting footage
brought me a commission to produce a film for a New England
brewery on the Red Sox team. Believe it or not, this assignment
came about the first of September and for nine games in Fen-
way Park I shot like a man possessed. ‘The resulting film included
the only triple play that has ever been photographed in its en-
tirety.

Since this first hurried assignment, I have produced seven films
on Big League baseball, including the Red Sox, Kansas City
Athletics and the Detroit Tigers. My present sponsor is the
Coca-Cola Company, who have also commissioned me to produce
instructional films on football and basketball. It is hard to say
where this line of photography will stop, and our little company
has all the business it can handle,

So when our diligent Class Committee charged with badger-
ing us already bedeviled souls into writing a simple narrative of
what we have accomplished in twenty-five years, I feel like the
fellow in the front row of a college class who has been day-
dreaming. “Who, me?” Well, as of now, I certainly have little
of which to complain. I am working at the thing I have always
wanted to do and my business allows me to travel to Europe,
both for work and pleasure, to shoot grouse in Scotland, ducks

in Manitoba, and our grouse and woodcock in Vermont in the
fall. Despite all this, I spend a surprising amount of time on

[114]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

state and natural conservation matters. Governor Christian Her-
ter appointed me to the Board of Natural Resources in Massachu-
setts for a total of eight years, and I am now president of the
Massachusetts Audubon Society, a job which, though demanding
and time-consuming, is most gratifying. We know that we are
contributing to a sound understanding of the natural world
around us and the importance of preserving it in this day of the
hydrogen bomb and Sputnik.

In the course of this period, I have been married to a most
patient and understanding woman, my wife Betty. Our family
of two girls and a boy have all but flown the nest. A grandfather
twice, I herewith put forth a cautious claim to first Class grand-
child: John Holden Batchelder, born May 24, 1955, to Jane Bor-
den Batchelder and Samuel L. Batchelder ’54. My Betsy was
married this last fall, and my son, Spencer, aged sixteen, is finish-
ing at Milton Academy next year. My work takes me into the
out-of-doors a good part of the time, and I have fortunately
avoided some of the sedentary aspects of many another business-
man. It has also made it possible for me to expose our children
to my love of nature and the out-of-doors, and I am glad to re-
port they seem to share it.

It would be very difficult, it seems to me, at any time since
our graduation to predict at all accurately the course our lives
have taken. As for me, “I played it by ear,” never knowing what
next, and still it seemed to work out surprisingly well. Betty
and I live in Concord with two lovely ponds in front of the
house, which in turn abut the Great Meadow National Wildlife
Refuge, so I not only work at wildlife, but we live surrounded
by it. In spite of the above, we do not lead a particularly wild
life.

OCCUPATIONALLY, my postgraduate career can be divided
into six equal periods. The first two were spent doing a general
real estate business; the third in naval service, most of it in per-
sonnel work, with a slight amount as a navigator at sea; and the
last three have been spent working up in the bank which now
employs me.

Being a specialist in real estate has its satisfactory aspects. As
much as is possible in a large institution, I am my own boss and
there are not too many people second-guessing me. Besides this,
my work keeps me out-of-doors a good deal.

The most important thing so far has been bringing up our
family and I hope when the children go out in the world that
Barbara and I can do the traveling we would like to but so far
have had to postpone. Our elder daughter is at St. Timothy’s
School near Baltimore, and our elder son is at Milton Academy.
I hope the younger ones, a boy in the seventh grade and a girl
in third can qualify for as good schools.

Charitable and educational responsibilities have been assumed
and I am glad to turn these over to younger men if they'll only
reach out for them.

Having been suburbanites for twenty-two years, our pleasures
and recreation are found in the country club sports, although we
have also taken several very enjoyable dude ranch vacations as a
family. No one is permitted to ride a horse, however, within
one thousand miles of home. Many evenings are taken up by
bridge games. I enjoy bridge tremendously, but my partners
are unanimous in correcting both bids and plays which I feel

are flawless. My only pet possession, which Barbara feels is an
obsession, is a new Volkswagen.

Summing up, I have never held public office, written a book,

Hampshire back into operation. This enterprise was succeeding
nicely and I was about to become a “confirmed bachelor” when
I met Edna in 1940.

I came to New York in December and got a job with General
Foods Corporation. Edna and I were married in April. A year
later I was in uniform, and soon thereafter on the way to Eng-
land. Three and one-half years later I returned to the States, and
shortly thereafter to General Foods,

Marine research and model making are still among my chief
interests. Several years ago I resumed playing the pipes, which
gives me, at least, a good deal of satisfaction. History and archae-

ology have always been subjects of great interest to me, and
comprise the bulk of my reading.

I was brought up as a Unitarian. Politically, I am a Republi-
can. However, I sometimes wonder if it makes much difference
which party holds the reins. In spite of all the lip service paid to

economy in government, neither party does anything about it
seriously.

FOLLOWING my four years in Cambridge I returned to a
midwestern environment and obtained my degree in medicine in
1937 at Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,
Missouri. The next five years were devoted to postgraduate
work, including two years at Lenox Hill Hospital, New York
City, where I finished as house surgeon, and the following two
years as resident obstetrician and gynecologist at Kensington
Hospital for Women in Philadelphia.

Our first child was born in Philadelphia when I was finishing
my residency training, and when my son was six months old I
returned to Dallas to embark on the career of the practice of
medicine. While trying to build up my private practice I gave
considerable time to the teaching of medical students and interns
for the next three years. In January, 1947, I became a partner
in the Dallas Medical and Surgical Clinic where I have since been
in the specialty of obstetrics and gynecology, with attention
to surgical gynecology. I have been closely associated with my
father and brother who have devoted full time to the same
specialty. My father retired from active practice several years
ago after almost sixty years of continuous practice.

After my fifteen years of specialty of gynecology, I still feel
that I cannot predict the psychological behavior of women any
more accurately than the various weather men can predict our
changeable Texas weather. But seriously, my chief hobbies, be-
sides women, are travel, photography, sports, sport cars and
hunting. I have attended medical meetings abroad, one in the
summer of 1954 at Geneva, Switzerland, and again this last
summer in Stockholm, Sweden. My interest in photography was
fulfilled on the extensive tours through southern Germany,
Italy and Switzerland before attending these medical conferences.

As a native of the Southwest I have enjoyed the enrichment
derived from seeing and observing the progress and personalities
of various foreign, as well as American medical centers. Also
my travels have given me a better understanding of our fast and
constantly changing world.

A GLANCE at the above statistics would indicate that I am
one of those legendary Bostonians for whom the Hudson River
marks the boundary of terra incognita. In fact I travel con-
tinuously on business and my territory extends from Miami, to
San Diego, to Seattle and back to Portland (Maine). During the
early forties I spent almost four years touring the storied islands
of the South Pacific and my happiest college memory is a sum-
mer’s bicycle trip through Europe with Classmates Sam Cabot,
Roger Howlett, Oscar Holden and Stu Scott, Having thus boasted
about my, for me, extensive travels, I shall now confess that the

garden spot of the universe does, in fact, lic just east of Worces-
ter, Massachusetts, and it is there the Bourneuf brood has settled.

[ 120]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

It is difficult to remember those peaceful days before May, 1957,
when I stepped into Fred Dearborn’s shoes as ringleader of the
general confusion leading up to our coming reunion. Like many
classmates my life is divided into two distinct periods. Before
the war I led a fairly typical bachelor existence centered around
skiing in the winter and golf in the summer and managed to make
enough money selling real estate with Jim Channing to make
both ends meet. Then came a long stretch in the field artillery
in such warm spots as Guadalcanal, Bougainville, and the Philip-
pines. My army jobs ranged from private to major and I kicked
myself daily for having passed up a chance to join the ski troops.

My life moved into high gear in the fall of 1945 when I mar-
ried Betsy, widow of R. Bennet Forbes, ’39, acquiring two de-
lightful stepdaughters. We settled down in Beverly Farms where
Joe and Jessie came along in due course. Everyone with chil-
dren knows that our life has been wrapped up with our kids’ ac-
tivities. We are fortunate in having every type of outdoor sport
at close hand and particularly enjoy the sailing and skiing, Next
summer, for a change, we hope to take the gang to a ranch.

In the fall of 1948 I forsook real estate brokerage for my present
occupation, being particularly attracted by a regular pay check
in lieu of sporadic commissions in view of my growing family.
I suppose that puts me in the much discussed and criticized group
who have preferred financial security to fiscal adventure. I
am happy with my choice. My job involves investing about one
million dollars a week in commercial building loans which in-
' volves interesting studies of future probabilities. Best of all we
are able to bring up our children in an attractive small-town
atmosphere with a minimum of worry about their health, edu-
cation and happiness.

I had the good fortune to be aide to General Marshall at the
1947 Harvard Commencement at which he proposed the Marshall
Plan, Before that time I hadn’t begun to appreciate what an
extraordinary institution we were members of. I was particular-
ly proud of our University’s courage and dignity during the hy-
steria of the McCarthy era and my admiration for what Harvard
is and does grows constantly. |

EVENTS come full circle this Twenty-fifth Anniversary year
of ours as my first-born son completes his senior year at Cornell,
while his two younger brothers prepare for college as | did at
Boston's Public Latin School. In their accomplishments, their
aspirations, their troubles and their share of moulding the future
lie the deepest satisfactions of my quarter-century since gradua-
tion —just as the little-considered textbooks had predicted.

Trying to interpret our times for three sons and to help them
find their standards is a full-time challenge. But there is also the
store to mind. My business activities fall into three periods:
prewar newspaper work, five years of Army duty during World
War II and postwar public relations work.

Newspaper training came from the old Boston Evening Tran-
script in the news room, the sports department and as education
editor and feature editor. Financial returns were small during
the final decade of a newspaper with notable tradition, but valua-

included.

Called to active duty late in 1940, I spent the next couple of

[122]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

years in charge of recruiting and induction publicity in the New
England area. Then came graduation from the Command and
General Staff School and successive Washington assignments
in public relations for the headquarters of Army Ground Forces,
the War Department Bureau of Public Relations, and duty as
Chief of Army Orientation.

After the war, I became director of public relations for Willys-
Overland Motors in Toledo, Ohio, with a program of economical
transportation through a line of motor vehicles based upon the
Jeep. It was an exciting experience, and after three years of it I
put all my chips on the venture of building my own public re-
lations consulting company in Toledo.

For a couple of years, Bowker & Company developed in such
promising fashion that it showed possibilities of realizing one of
the American dreams. But the combination of some misguided
business moves and an extended illness proved too great a burden
for the young enterprise: It and I were wiped out.

I joined Allen B. DuMont Laboratories in Clifton, New Jersey,
as public relations director for this pioneering firm in television
and electronics, Early in 1957 I had the opportunity to become
public relations director of U.S. Plywood Corporation, which
had grown to the world’s largest plywood organization and one
of the 200 largest corporations in the country. This assignment
offers a most satisfying challenge, calling upon the full scope
of my experience and talents.

Travels have been extensive through eighteen countries, leav-
ing me with an abiding conviction that men of good will are
making some progress in spite of all the problems crying for
solutions. Better communications will help, and I find real
satisfactions through my work in the communications field.

To offset five days a week of confining work at the office I
spend as much time as possible outdoors on weekends and during
a four-week vacation. Hunting, fishing, gardening and house
repairs occupy most of this leisure time. Two English setters,
which I keep at home, afford an excuse for many enjoyable
walks over the Missouri countryside, with or without a gun.

I am looking forward to the next twenty-five years and hoping
they are as enjoyable as the last.

MY life since college has been divided into a number of dis-
tinct phases: four years as a reporter on the city staff of the
New York Herald Tribune, four years in Philadelphia helping
Smith, Kline & French Laboratories to advertise their specialties
to doctors and druggists, four years in the Army Air Forces
working at public relations, first for the Training Command in
the United States, and later in India, Burma and China; four post-
war years in and around New York City in editorial magazine
~ work, plus a whirl at short-story writing and free-lance public
relations; and the last eight years running my own business,
which involves the planning, preparation and production of high-
grade corporate literature —annual reports, company histories,
employee manuals, promotion brochures and the like, for busi-
ness and non-profit organizations. I have been particularly happy
in this last phase, since it requires a synthesis of the principal
skills I had acquired over the years.

So when I embarked on the chore which Mr. Sullivan set for all
of us, I set down what seemed the important things which had
happened during each of these phases—-and very soon became
bored by the result, because I was repeating myself. For each
phase, I was writing that what I liked most was the endless va-
riety of the things I had been called upon to do, plus the won-
derful, able people I had met in the process, So let's say it once
and have done with it.

For the past twenty years I have been greatly blessed by a fine
wife, who has miraculously been able to make a name for her-
self in the world and to run her household at the same time. I have

[125]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

also been blessed by three magnificent children. Since our mar-

riage, except for the war years, we have lived principally in the
country, where we have had rather more than our share of pets.
These have included two lions, a raccoon, a loon, a great horned
owl, several chipmunks and squirrels, barbery doves, a number
of parrots, as well as goats, sheep and many, many dogs and cats.
As far as improving the home is concerned, after years of ex-
perience in activities ranging from tiling bathrooms to coping
with the sump pump, I have adopted the slogan: “Don’t think
of doing it yourself; get somebody else.” I still do mow the
lawn. My principal current hobbies are reading, raising black
Labrador retrievers, playing tennis, photography, playing the
piano very badly and upland game shooting. I am a registered
Republican, but I don’t always vote that way.

I would like to close by saying that my debt to Harvard is
a great one. My four years as an undergraduate in Cambridge
gave me what I needed to get my career under way and Jaid

many of the foundations for the good life which I have been so
fortunate to lead to date.

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

AS far as business goes, I have worked for the above concern
for the past twenty years, and although I have enjoyed it, I do not
find myself very far up the list of Uncle Sam’s tax brackets.

I am proud of my family life, and it has been wonderful watch-
ing our four boys grow up, with the usual moments of mental
anguish but no real trouble. Fate has been kind in allowing
Barbara and me to share the interests and activities of the boys at
any age along the way. Tony, our eldest, prepared at Milton
Academy and graduated from Williams in June, 57 . . . which,
incidentally, is a college I can recommend highly. A week after
graduation he married Carroll Benton of Mt. Gilead, Ohio, who
is a great success with every member of the family, and is now
supporting him while he attends the Graduate School of Archi-
tecture connected with that University in New Haven. Ned pre-
pared at Proctor Academy and went through freshman year at
Colorado College where his grades were no problem but he
was not too happy, so he tried to transfer without success. After
working this past summer in the oil fields in Wyoming, he en-
listed in the Navy, and after a month at the training center in
San Diego ( at this writing), his letters sound surprisingly cheer-
ful. Dick is a junior at Lenox School . . . as for college, time
will tell. Bob has just started Junior High i in Weston, and as of
the moment there is only one college, Harvard. Smart boy!

We have lived in Weston since we were married and spent
at least part of every summer at South Orleans on Cape Cod,
where I have cast into the surf from the outer beach more times
under more circumstances without catching a striped bass than
any living white man, but I have the faith of the Red Sox .
wait till next year!

Except for bowling in the winter, my recreational interests
are for the most part | outdoors, such as golf, fishing, upland and
waterfowl hunting . . , the latter really being my ‘favorites.

Along the civic line, I have become very ‘much interested in
the Boy Scouts of America, which I am sure many of you have
discovered is a well worthwhile organization, and with whom
I have had a variety of jobs with our local council. I am serving
on the Weston Recreation Commission, and as chairman of the
Disaster Relief Committee of the Weston Red Cross, I fervently
pray that there will be no disaster.

those first, long years grappling with the world following our
graduation. A lot of boys were separated from the men in those
days; I stayed young a long time. But after a little while (1 think
it was three or four years later) I got the knack of the thing and
had a job every now and then. I hadn’t followed into the museum
courses after my fine arts A.B. because I decided I'd rather draw
the pictures than sell, buy and hang them. However, I also
hadn’t spent too much time learning how. So a good stretch of
time had to be spent on that “little” angle. |
As World War II jumped on us, I was hand-printing wallpaper,
designing, and knocking out cartoons by the hundreds, if pos-
sible. Then I went to work in the glass-blowing department of
a defense plant manufacturing high-power transmission tubes,
and remained there as one of their foremen for the duration. I
almost continued on in this business, but ’'d worked up too much
enthusiasm for the art world and so happily returned to it, where
I still am being kept very interestingly busy designing cartoon
booklets. |
My wife may not be as joyous as I am about my having a
studio at home; however, it comes out that she gets a lot of work
out of me around the house. So everybody’s happy. We love
living at a commuting distance from New York. We have a
house with beach on Long Island Sound, water sports and confu-
sion in the summer. Whenever things start to get drably routine,
the football game at New Haven comes around, and we have
characters like Bartol, Keville, David, Burrage and Cassedy come
down for a spot of tea that weekend. Never a dull moment
around here.

of 1944 I passed an examination for Master (unlimited) of steam
and motor vessels.

In 1946, I was lucky enough to win the hand of the fine girl
who is now, and will ever be, my wife. That same year I got
a ship of my own. The seagoing life continued until 1950.
““Tramping” all over the world. The long periods away from
home (we lived in three different, widely separated places dur-
ing these periods) and a strong desire to get back ashore — pre-
ferably in the shipping business— prompted me to make the
jump — and to stick it out for a lean period — until I was taken
into the Martin Company in Baltimore. I have been with the
company ever since.

In February, 1956, I asked for, and received, a transfer to
the new Denver facility. ‘There was opportunity which counter-
balanced the desire to be near the ocean. I’ve never regretted
the move. The Martin Company has been good to me.

It is no longer a secret that we are in a research and develop-
ment program for the government —to fabricate and test the
Titan missile (ICBM). The pressure is great, but the work is
very interesting, and, as recent events have borne out, essential.

In conclusion, may I add that I am not a “joiner,” am not a
success, when success is measured either by recognition or a bank
account, but that I am happy both at home and at work, I ap-
preciate the opportunity given me by both a class and a univer-
sity (to which I have contributed little) to participate in a
“twenty-fifth.” I cannot return to Cambridge for the festivities.
I'll enjoy reading of the accomplishments of my classmates. My
beloved Dad will be celebrating his sixty-second class reunion and
will stand in for me. I couldn’t have a better representative. .

AFTER graduation I succeeded in selling my services to the per-
sonnel officer of the Second National Bank of Boston despite the
fact that they were reducing the number of employees at that
time and I have never regretted making this choice. Many fields
would have been more rewarding than banking from a financial
point of view but none more satisfactory to me because of the
associations and friendships developed. As assistant vice-president
of Second Bank-State Street Trust Company I am concerned
with collateral loans particularly those secured by insurance.
Other activities include personnel and expense control of the
Credit and Loan Division.

It would appear that my life is one of few if any regrets be-
cause I also have been blessed with a most harmonious marriage
and home life in general. This fact has undoubtedly been the
reason I have limited my outside activities but I would prefer a
life of contentment to one of perpetual activity. Although sports
have always been of real interest to me, a mild physical condition
has apparently eliminated all but hunting; but again I have been
fortunate since my son is equally addicted to this form of sport.
Reading and building model ships are other hobbies which |
have found most rewarding. Although politics on the local level
seemed to be interesting immediately after graduation, a brief
experience in this field convinced me that it was not for me.
Consequently, I have found that I should confine my activities
to the non-political affairs in the town where I chose to live.

OCCUPATION: Salesman.

MEMBER OF: Harvard Clubs of New York and Southern California.

HAVING eschewed the family legal tradition I entered upon
a miscellaneous assortment of jobs upon leaving college — all in
the publishing field — until an early summons from Uncle (a
result of R.O.T.C. at Cambridge) called me into the Army a year
before Pearl Harbor. The fates of war conspired to keep me
in this country training others until the very last minute, when
our division (16th Armored) was finally shipped to Europe and
achieved the dubious distinction of being the last American
division to be committed during the war.

Subsequently, I spent two years in New York as publicity di-
rector for the National Association of Cost Accountants, and
then joined with a friend of mine for a number of years in build-
ing a Long Island housing development known as Rollingwood.
A complete change of venue was indicated in 1951 (vide vital
statistics above), and after a period of working as a ranch hand,
laborer and timekeeper on a construction job I managed to ally
myself with a wonderful group of dedicated Ivy Leaguers who
were endeavoring to push the struggling western magazine Fort-
night into the black side of the ledger. As promotion and cir-
culation director, I tried valiantly for four years to help achieve
this goal, and fun though it was, my job involved spending money
which became a little bit difficult as the coffers slowly dried up.
But the experience made a Westerner out of me, for which I’m
grateful, and residence in Southern California seems certain in
the foreseeable future. At the moment I’m once again pulling
myself up by my own bootstraps — this time via the sales field —

but wouldn't dare to predict the outcome of my latest venture.
Suffice it to say that Hope Springs Eternal.

[larvard-wise, I have been active both on the Schools and
Scholarship Committee of the Harvard Club of Southern Cali-
fornia, as well as handling the Santa Monica end of the Program
for Harvard College. My only other extra-curricular activity is
active participation in Army ‘Reserve training.

My deep conv iction that attending Harvard was a significant
event in my life remains unchanged. With a nephew in the
present freshman class and a number of potentials for the ’6o0’s
and ’7o’s, I hope the family tradition will continue.

AS I sit and try to recollect the past twenty-five years, I find my-
self almost at a loss where to begin. I reported before that I tried
my hand at the manufacture and sale of foods. I have sold paper
items and even tried the textile field for a few years. Finally, I
realized that half of our population does not need or wear clothes
(of wool). So I returned to the paper field and at present am in-
terested in all types of packaging, particularly in the corrugated
box field. My association is with the Industrial Container Cor-
poration of New York.

In 1937, I married Edith Madeleine Por of Budapest, Hungary.
She was an exchange student at Temple University. We have
three children and a Siamese cat. Since the last Report, one of our

South Jersey to enjoy the ocean breezes there. Jon, our oldest, is
a sophomore at Cheltenham High with aspirations of entering
Harvard in the future. Daniel, our second son, is in the seventh
grade in Junior High, an excellent scholar, winner of the Amer-
ican Legion Award, looking forward to being a scientist. Laurie,
our daughter, is in kindergarten; has a decided personality and
keeps the household in a general uproar. Ours is a close knit fam-
ily enjoying doing things together. We have returned to Harvard
twice visiting the campus and various museums. I was tremen-
dously impressed by Harvard’s growth.

Music is one of my hobbies. I enjoy my record collection, at-
tending concerts and operas. I sing tenor for my own enjoy-
ment and participate in choir singing. Woodwork and “do-it-
yourself” projects occupy much of my leisure hours. I have voted
Democratic since I left Cambridge. My belief is that if we want
to survive in this insane armament race, our leaders will have to
come to some sort of an understanding with the Soviet Union for-
bidding the use of atomic weapons and missiles. I am active in the
Reform branch of Judaism.

As I look at world affairs, I feel that we as Americans must try
to reestablish the leadership that we once had. It is time that the
President of our country should enlist the best brains of both
parties to guide us on our way.

what by my four peaceful, unhurried years there, I decided to

continue my “studies” at the Law School. There, the pace was

Not quite so unhurried, but nevertheless, it was pleasant and even

stimulating. Surviving, I graduated in 1936 and commenced the

practice of law in Boston. An attitude of general indifference to
the availability of my legal services becoming painfully apparent,

I surrendered to one of the basic cravings, an inordinate desire to

eat regularly (still one of my failings) and took myself to Wash-

ington where I worked first as an attorney for the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation and then, in the early days of the war, with
the Office of Alien Property Custodian, engaged in the seizure and
administration of enemy-owned assets located in the United
States.

Shortly after the war began, I was drafted. I served first as a
radio technician with the Air Force and then, after a brief so-
journ doing legal work in England, I joined the Criminal Investi-
gation Division of the Army and spent one and one-half years in
that activity in England, France, Belgium and Germany.

Upon my return from the war, I rejoined the Office of Alien
Property, which was then a division of the Department of Jus-
tice. I participated as a representative of the U.S. Government
in negotiations at the Brussels Inter-Allied Reparations Agency
meetings leading to the Inter-Custodial Agreement, an adjunct of
the Paris Reparations Agreement.

I left the Department of Justice in the fall of 1950 at which time
I was chief of the Foreign Funds Control Division of the Office of
Alien Property. I have since been the Washington attorney for
Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., and, at the present time, am
assistant general attorney of CBS Television. In the light of the
recent growth of television both in communications and « entertain-
ment, my work has been both novel and interesting, if not earth-
shaking. Generally, it has been fun being a part of the develop-
ment of this exciting new medium.

In the meantime, along the way, I got married and, since the end
of the war, have had three children. The family, together with
my job, takes up most of my time and I have few, if any, hobbies
outside of reading, socializing and politicking in a small way in
the Democratic fold. As to the last, my enthusiasm therefor has
increased since 1952 as has my disenchantment with Washington
Republican operations during the same period.

BETWEEN graduation from the Harvard Law School and Pearl
Harbor, I was engaged in general law practice in New York City
with a firm, ultimately known as Parker & Duryee, of which I be-
came a member late in 1941. General practice meant drawing wills
for people, defending libel suits, assessing the maneuvers of
minority stockholders and advising elevator men about the possi-
bilities of recovery under the Workmen’s Compensation Act. It
meant assisting one’s bosses and partners in promoting and defend-
ing various civic and charitable activities in which they were
interested. It meant trying to learn to write English. Above all it
meant doing all this in association with men who were wise,
cultivated, liberal and enterprising. In retrospect it was utterly
fascinating. .

With the fall of France one cast about for ways and means of
learning the technique of shouldering a musket. My opportunity
came on the drill floor of the New York State Guard. In March,
1942, I was commissioned in the Army Air Force. After some
months in Washington, working on personnel procurement mat-
ters for the Air Force, I was transferred to O.S.S., who sent me,
in December, 1942, after appropriate training, to England. I
spent the remainder of the war, mostly in London, as part of a
joint British-American establishment charged with the devclop-
ment, control] and support of underground resistance to the Ger-
mans in France, Scandinavia and the Low Countries. The end of
the war saw me briefly in charge of the O.S.S, mission in London.

In 1946 I returned to New York. Law practice and work with
the City Bar Association, particularly the Committee on State

[ 138 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

Legislation, of which I was chairman, accounted for most of my
working hours until the fall of 1949. An exception was the sum-
mer of 1948 which I spent in Washington working for the
Hoover Commission as a staff member of the Committee on the
National Security Organization of which Ferdinand Eberstadt
was chairman.

A friendship which developed after the war with a fellow mem-
ber of the Bar Association led to an invitation to go to Germany
as Assistant General Counsel to the newly-appointed U.S. High
Commissioner for Germany, Mr. McCloy. The General Counsel’s
office was responsible for all the legal business of the High Com-
mission which included such matters as the formulation and ad-
ministration of programs for the decartelization and deconcentra-
tion of German industry, the general supervision of the adminis-
tration of justice in both the German and occupation courts, re-
view of all legislation enacted by the newly-created Federal
Republic, the resolution of innumerable legal problems raised by
the application of treaty or regulation to the activities of the
High Commission and finally such ad hoc but prolonged, complex
and politically contentious undertakings as the review of sen-
tences, capital and otherwise, of Germans convicted of war
crimes. A year and a half in this office provided an interesting
perspective on the United States in action abroad.

In 1951 I returned to the United States, continuing to work
with the government in Washington. As of the date of publica-
tion of this Report I shall again be in Germany as a special ad-
viser to the U.S. Ambassador on various matters.

As to hobbies, the pleasantest thing in life, and possibly the
most important, is shooting at ruffed grouse and woodcock in
New Hampshire in October.

HAVING led a life of comparative obscurity, I find it difficult
to recount my mundane adventures and make them interesting
reading. So that no one will waste any sympathy on me, I
hasten to add that I have thoroughly enjoyed my life’s pattern,
haven’t done much to be ashamed of and even may have made
a small contribution toward co-existence in this world.

My college life was foreclosed when my 1932 final payment
was short a “C” note. Back home in San Francisco, I found the
world of trade quite unreceptive to my talents as the great de-
pression had really settled in and taken over. So, for two years,
I learned a lot about life, somewhat less about golf and bridge
and a little about what to do with the small amount of money I
earned as a salesman of G. E. appliances. In June of 1934, I cast
aside the security of this $100 a month job and the comforts of
living at home to go to work for Lockheed Aircraft at forty
cents an hour and live in a cold water flat in Burbank. Two
months later, giddy with self-confidence, I was married and be-
came a householder in Los Angeles.

The first seven years spent working in this arsenal of Democ-
racy proved effective enough that I had to stay behind while
most of my friends went off to do battle with the enemy. The
only battle 1 was in was my own personal Battle of the Bulge,
but no citation was forthcoming for losing thirty-five pounds.
The next five years spent making as much material as possible

air worthy, teaching aircraft trainees at night school and making
fifteen deposits in the Red Cross Bank sums up my war record
and government service.
In the summer of 1946, 1 bought into our present source of
livelihood; and two years later, 1 was put in charge of the com-

pany, the position I now hold. We employ about thirty people
and manage to have netted enough for a honeymoon trip to
Acapulco in 1952, a tour of the South in 1954 and a Hawaiian
cruise in 1956. We just may go to New England in 1958.

My oldest son is off to a slow start in the business world, as
yet not sure of what he wants to do. Since leaving high school,
he has been a mechanic, painter (industrial), salesman, college
student, motorcycle racer, bank teller and a full-fledged Army
private. My second boy is half way through Pomona College,
with his sights set on transferring to Caltech. The next three
children, though still in their formative years, show definite
signs of developing into equally interesting characters with
equally divergent interests. Our baby girl, now going through
the “terrible twos,” is responsible for my latest hobby, house-
building. By the time this is in print, I hope to have laid aside
my trowel, saw and hammer and have picked up where I left off
in our acre-and-a-half of avocado trees.

My voting record shows I have no political party convictions,
voting for Norman Thomas in 1932, then for all those Roose-
velts, etc., and finally for Eisenhower in 1956. Religious and so-
cial beliefs have led me to feel that all people are nice; some are
just nicer than others. On rare occasions, I have been convinced
otherwise.

employment with the same company, specializing in one type of
ship and membership in the Marine Engineers’ Beneficial Associ-

pected results. A recent voyage involved carrying grain from the
Pacific Northwest to India, loading oil in the Persian Gulf for
delivery in San Francisco and then preparing to load grain again.

During these times of dramatic scientific developments, major
social changes, world frictions, economic straits of governments
and some secular trends in religious organizations, it seems im-
prudent to maintain previous convictions, other than faith in God,
without due appraisal.

I HAVE spent the last twenty-five years of my life in attempting

to bring to a fruitful conclusion the ideals which, in 1933, seemed
important to me.

First it was necessary for me to become trained in some field
from which I could earn a living. I therefore enrolled at the Bent-
ley School of Accounting and Finance in the fall of 1933 and

raduated an accountant in 1937.

Secondly, I decided that a mate was necessary and became mar-
ried in September, 1937, to a very faithful and devoted wife and
mother — a girl who has been a fathomless source of inspiration,
comfort and companionship to me ever since.

Thirdly, the honeymoon being over, the household sounding
like the interior of the main study at Widener, we decided to fill
it with some activity. The result was the birth of four sons —
1938, 1940, 1941 and 1945. This decision made it paramount that
I burn the midnight oil, a routine which I have followed religiously
since 1938. Since then it has been a constant battle of trying to
earn and keep enough so that all charge accounts could be met on
time, a challenge which I have attempted to meet by working as
an auditor for the Employers’ Liability Assurance Corporation,
developing my own public accounting practice and engaging ina
general insurance brokerage as an extra-curricular activity.

From my experiences I have come to the conclusion that today

[ 146 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

every American family needs an accountant, an attorney and a
doctor in its midst. This deduction has spurred me to see what
I might be able to accomplish with the basic ingredients at my
disposal. We already have an accountant — yours truly. My
oldest offspring is now a sophomore at Tufts University — a bio-
chemistry major with medical school as his ultimate goal. My
second son is preparing to enter college in 1958, not to be an
attorney, so I was forcefully informed. I still have hopes of en-
couraging one of the remaining two along legal lines, hoping
thereby to fill the need created by our present day economics.

As I reflect upon what life has held in store for me during the
past twenty-five years, I wonder what the next twenty-five will
be like, especially since I am now supporting my first son at col-
lege, expect to support the second shortly, the third within the
next three years and the fourth in about six years. I often ask
myself, “Would you do it over again?” My answer would be,
“Yes, with a few detours.”

My war record consisted of the usual “Greetings,” the at-
tendant physical and the resulting classification to limited service
— if needed.

- My traveling was all wrapped up in my honeymoon — an oc-
casion which brought me to New York, Philadelphia and Wash-
ington, D.C. My hobbies? For quite a number of years I was
quite an ardent boxing fan, an enthusiasm for the sport being
chilled by the modern TV Monster. I have finally managed to
allow myself one night per week for bowling. My new set of
golf clubs has been used only once and then by my son. Religion?
I have zealously followed the faith of my forebears —— Roman
Catholic —and have taken a very active part in church affairs.
Politically? I am a registered Democrat who has voted the Re-
publican ticket more often than the Democratic one — probably
due to Mrs. Bruno who is a die-hard Republican.

In summation I feel that God has been good to me, having
blessed me with a devoted wife, a healthy family and the facul-

ties to have been able, to this point, to meet the challenges of
life. |

months, all spent in Naval hospitals on the east coast. I never offi-

From 1946 to 1952 I was radiologist at Truesdale Hospital in

I HAVE little to add to the brief report submitted to the Class
Secretary some ten years ago. My wife and I take pride in one
recent event, however. Our daughter, Nancy Lee, has received
her A.B. degree from Mary Washington College in Fredericks-
burg, Virginia, and is now studying in London, England. We are
now happily discussing the prospect of visiting her there during
the course of the coming year. My own status is relatively un-
changed. I shall soon be rounding out fifteen years of service with
the government, including a brief and undistinguished career in
the Army. Looking back over the twenty-five years since gradu-
ation, I am struck with the thought that so few of my youthful
ambitions have been realized. The Great Depression left certain
scars that are still visible. All in all, however, I have neither re-
grets nor complaints. I have found government work both chal-

sociazione Italo-Americana.

CHANGES in 1933 started the difficult years of going through
Northwestern University Law School, from 1933 to 1936 at
the Chicago campus. Then followed the practice of Jaw in
Chicago until the end of 1942, four of the six years specializing
in trade marks.

Outside hobbies were in a number of different fields, my first
love, however, being the “little theater” of which in those days
there were about thirty-five in Chicago (I don’t know what the
situation is now). I belonged to several of those thirty-five,
served as president of two and played almost every kind of a
part both on stage and in radio. This phase of my life, as well
as others, ended in 1942, when I took the first step in satisfying
my ambition to speak a foreign language, and with some private
lessons, much work, and as a member of the Pan American
Council of Chicago, 1 got to speak what I thought (or hoped)
to be a fluent Spanish, although probably not too grammatic.

The year 1943 found me in Uncle Sam’s Army stationed in
the United States. From 1944 to 1946 I was an agent of the CID
(still in the Army) in northeastern France. I was in Paris a few
days after the liberation, then at Rheims, Soissons, Epernay, Laon,
Auxerre and Nancy. The close association with the French of-

[150 ]

ficials having to do with criminal affairs I found intensely inter-
esting, at least as I look back on it now.

Perfecting myself in the French language also was a satisfac-
tion, and I remember my early days in Germany (where I went
in March, 1946) how glad I was for any chance to speak French
in contrast to my labors in German (one year of German at
Harvard in 1931) which I found exceedingly difficult. Later the
reverse was to be true. As a civilian in 1946 I worked out of
Berlin in the “denazification” program as an inspector and in
connection with the “tribunals” in our so-called “internment
camps” throughout the American zone. Later I was in Military
Government Intelligence.

Early in 1948 I entered the State Department Foreign Service
and was assigned to Berlin with the rank of consul. The more
interesting part of my stay in Berlin was the first year, which
coincided with the blockade of that city. In contrast to the
Germans, the Americans living there suffered little, although
priding themselves that they were “making history.” The latter
part of my stay was more comfortable as Berlin became less
of a fortress. And the stay was brightened by my marriage, at
last, in 1952, for which Washington’s permission had to be
obtained.

During 1953 and 1954 I was principal officer of a small con-
sulate at Isfahan, Persia, a city which some consider the pearl of
the Middle East. In August, 1953, with the difficulties in Teh-
ran, rioting became so severe in Isfahan that I had to close the
consulate temporarily. After the trouble was over we learned
that we had been on the list of those to be liquidated. In the
meantime guards had been put on our house, and one evening
the guard on duty informed one of our servants that the com-
munists were planning to kill my wife and me during the night
and “would we please leave the light on outside” so that he
could better guard. We did as he said and slept as soundly that
night as any other. I wonder now, when thinking about it, just
how we had the temerity to so sleep.

With reluctance, early in 1955 we left Isfahan, and after home
leave in the States in which we toured the South in a rented
automobile, we were assigned to Genoa, Italy. There we were
fortunate enough to find a dwelling with a view of the harbor

[151]

where we could see all the ships entering and leaving. In Sep-
tember of this year (1957) we said good-bye to Genoa, and since
then I have been at the Foreign Service Institute attending a
“Mid-Career Officers’ Course.” Whether I shall continue in
this service with its uncertainties and Arger (which has not been
specified here), I do not know at the present writing.

IN 1933 a degree in French Literature was not very useful — so
over to the Business School I went. After specializing in Com-
mercial Banking, I have been engaged in many projects other than
that: two- to three-year periods in real estate, merchandising,
manufacturing, sales promotion and then at age thirty-eight into
the life insurance business. I have spent eight of the happiest
years of my life here in Grand Rapids in my present work. I am
looking forward to spending the rest of my life here doing just
the same thing.

My family includes a charming and handsome wife, chosen at
our ages twenty-nine (after paying off H.B.S. and accumulating
$1,000 besides), and an equally attractive daughter, approaching
eleven. (Sorry we don’t have more!)

- There were two and one-half years in the Army filled with
frustration, when anything of real value that I knew was not
used (and I sold a business to volunteer for that).

Hobbies include my family and my home, located on too large
a plot of ground with too many trees (and too many leaves in the
fall). The nature of my work also becomes a hobby at times, as
does the participation in one or two community drives a year. A
bad knee (soccer) and back have Kept me away from horses for
several years.

People and their problems interest me. I believe that man is
fundamentally good — and if not apparent, the goodness is there
to be developed. Since I feel incapable of solving the mystery of
life, probably “reverent agnostic” best describes me. But most
important, I work hard at being a “good man.” Both my wife
and I, at our marriage, dedicated our lives to bringing happiness
to others. Politically, I try to vote for the best man but I believe
the Republicans have received a majority of my votes.

AFTER leaving college, I had an uneasy feeling that only one
side of the coin had been seen—the copybook moral maxim
side; the world outside our warm red brick walls seemed as dark,
unknown, mysterious and inviting as when I had first left my
modest home in Illinois two years before. With all its charm
and enjoyment, formal education seemed to me to fit one only
for more education —a training, or if you will an acculturation
that could only be found in inarticulate, uncodified wisdom by
which “the great unwashed” lived, struggled, suffered and died
—so near and yet so far from my life so far.

In pursuit of this other training, or experience, I deliberately
sought out the husks and squalor of cities — Boston, New York,
Chicago and most of those in between, living in flop houses,
working as a bus-boy, commission salesman for the Encyclopedia
Britannica, bell-hop — almost anything easy to come by and al-
lowing an area of clear conscience and mental leisure. In this
course, the low-brows, the psychos, the lushes and the just plain
bums of all ages and degrees were my teachers — the finest any-

one with the capacity to appreciate and evaluate could ever
know. I filled hundreds of notebooks and scrapbooks, and re-

learned the Jore of survival, I studied socicty from the worm’s

[154]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

eye view, and without bitterness, put some of the product down
in a couple of books, privately published to the tumultuous silence
of all hands, but with a feeling of satisfaction that no graduate
thesis ever gave me, when I used to turn them out at a dollar
a page in my freshman year for tired and affluent upperclassmen.

All this took until about 1936, when during an interlude of
specious prosperity, I became a little suspicious that I still didn’t
have it all, and with all the hurrah of the New Deal, some others
didn’t either. The children grubbing for bits of edible garbage
in the local dump in clear view of the best country club’s nine-
teenth hole, put me off my game and made me feel as if I must at-
tempt to communicate and join with the still more beaten world
of the settled urban marginal wage earner, the “Working Stiff,”
the rural share-croppers, the dispossessed, the relief classes,
crushed by circumstances to a status between life and death,
without even the will or wish to rebel or escape. My previous
associates had been gallant adventurers and picaresque heroes
compared to these new circles. For three more years, I dug
away, trying to experience the pressures, the restraints, the ta-
boos and codes that kept these people docile and receptive to
what seemed unbearable and unnecessary misery. In this period
I sampled the jails, reform schools, insanse asylums, “Homes,”
“Camps” and all the rest of the vast institutionalization which
maintained the general system, mostly without reaching any
consistent conclusions or solutions, but laying at least a realistic
ground work for any future plan or program which might be
developed. _

The war interposed on my “researches” about the time I be-
gan to think I was getting somewhere, and I went into the armed
services, first as a civilian, and then in a military capacity for
the Navy. After serving in various capacities in the Atlantic,
Gulf and Pacific Areas, I found myself in MIDPAC (Hawaii)
at the war’s end. Accepting further service with SCAP in Tokyo
as a civilian again, I found I could study the same subjects, and
even do a small bit toward their improvement, in the vast adven-
ture of the Occupation. I have remained in that area ever since,
with fairly frequent visits to the States interspersed for relief
—to my ever-increasing fascination with what mankind will
put up with before he busts out all over the apple cart. I have

now constructed a crude calculus of the tolerance point after
personally observing China in ’49; Korea in ’50; Viet Nam in 53
and setting up my own little handicap for who’s next. It ain’t
pretty, brothers, but nobody could call it a bore.

SINCE graduating from Harvard Law School I have been engaged

1956, running for the first time, I was the Democratic candidate
for the Massachusetts House of Representatives from Natick and
lost to the incumbent by 114 votes. This was less than one per-
cent of the total vote of over 12,500. I expect to try again in
1958.

1 am also entering another 1958 contest. As my wife is expect-

AFTER college I came back to Vermont to live and probably

As in college, I seem to prefer the unpopular side of issues. Ex-
ample — being a Democrat in Vermont. This attitude has not
led to a quick success. What success I have achieved has come in
spite of it, but on the other hand it has allowed me freedom of
expression which I must admit gives me pleasure.

I have a good country law practice, a devoted daughter, and a
not too over-indulgent wife. I enjoy people, but I am against

“Doing Things Together” or “Thinking Alike.” All in all, I have

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

I WAS graduated from Harvard Law School in 1936, and after
thirteen months’ employment by the firm of Lynch & Cann in
White Plains, New York, I returned to my family home in
Poughkeepsie and have since practised law there, where both my
father and grandfather were lawyers in their lifetime. I started
practice in the office of Raymond G. Guernsey (Yale) and we
were later joined by William J. Walsh (Dartmouth). Our firm,
Guernsey, Butts and Walsh, carries on a general practice, but
specializes in probate, real estate, trial, corporate and tax work.

During World War II, my Navy tour included two years of
sea duty as an armed guard officer and six months as legal officer
at a Seabee base, Camp Endicott, at Davisville, Rhode Island.

Since 1950 my family and I have spent the summers (and
spring and fall weekends) at our cottage at the Candlewood
Lake Club near Brookfield, Connecticut. It is only forty-two
miles from Poughkeepsie and I drive in to work several days a
week during the summer. At the lake we enjoy lots of golf
and swimming and a bit of frustrating fishing. The rest of the
year I’m kept enjoyably busy by my work, various community
activities and my family. In 1950 I ran for mayor of Pough-
keepsie on the Democratic ticket, but was defeated.

My wife, Eleanor (Vassar 1936), and I enjoy a game of golf
or bridge as often as possible, which isn’t often enough. My
other main hobby at present is stamps — U.S. and British Col-
onies. I made the mistake of helping my oldest son with his
collection about two years ago and haven’t come up for air
since.

PUBLICATIONS: Short story accepted by the New Yorker.

AFTER graduation I went into the family paint business, Samuel
Cabot, Inc., which my grandfather started in 1877. After various
jobs in our factory and laboratory in Chelsea and in the Boston
office, I achieved the position of traffic manager about 1939 and
became treasurer a year or two later. After the war I returned to
that job and have been there ever since. Treasurer is not a full-
time job in a small company like ours, so I get plenty of chances to
interfere in the activities of other departments.

In 1939 I got married and have been favored with a perfectly
balanced family: two boys, two girls, two prewar, two postwar;
had it not been for Hitler and Mussolini we would probably have
six children. .

When the Germans invaded the Low Countries in May, 1940,
I figured that America would be in the war in a few months, so
I hastened to enlist in a Field Artillery battery in the Massachu-
setts National Guard. I fought in the battle of Potsdam, New
York, in that summer’s maneuvers and then, finding that there
was no prospect of action for some time, I resigned. After Pearl
Harbor I got a commission as a second lieutenant in the Army Air
Forces, went to training school in Miami for six weeks, was as-
signed to the 56th Fighter Group and shortly turned up in Eng-
land, where I spent almost two years. Early in 1945 I was trans-
ferred to the Air Transport Command and finished out the hos-
tilities in Africa. During the Korean War I again offered my
sword to my country, but was told by a polite young lieutenant
that the Air Force had no need for superannuated ground officers.

I band birds for a hobby and have recently tried my hand at
writing. The New Yorker magazine has accepted one of my short
stories; it has not yet been published, but they have paid me for
it and I trust that it will appear in print before the Reunion.

AT the risk of being redundant, I shall have to repeat for the most
part what I have already written in previous reports. Also, may
I say at the outset, that I have never felt quite so aged as I do at
this moment, looking back in retrospect, as I must, over that pro-
digious span of twenty-five years. It seems like yesterday when I
was chatting with Leverett Saltonstall at the Stadium on the oc-
casion both of his Twenty-fifth Reunion and of our Commence-
ment exercises. Now our own Twenty-fifth is right around the
corner and I, in turn, shall be chatting with some young alumnus,
come next June.

As Larry Illoway has put it many times, we were the misbe-
gotten children of the worst economic era in our history. Being
one of its victims, I set my sights on a career which afforded
security, namely, education. I took a Master’s; then the examina-
tion for appointment to the City of Boston School System. But
alas! Openings were few and appointments slow. The Civilian

[ 161 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

Conservation Corps offered me a position in Haddam, Connecti-
cut, as educational adviser, which I seized with alacrity. Unfor-
tunately, this was a dead end, in addition to which my idea of edu-
cation and that of the C.C.C. differed radically. Further, I was
unsuccessful in convincing my superiors that the time I spent in
New London at the Connecticut College for Women was related
in any way to my official duties. Thus, we parted company in
1936.

Next, I became a salesman for the American Tobacco Com-
pany, with the principal function not of selling Lucky Strike,
but of introducing the chant of the tobacco auctioneer to the
public. In order to accomplish this function, I was furnished
with a victrola and a record which I had to play in such places
as restaurants, drug stores and tobacco shops. Needless to say,
I was persona non grata, and even George Washington Hill was
unable to prevail upon me to continue in this capacity.

Finally, in 1937 I entered the insurance field in which I have
been engaged ever since, with the exception of the war years,
1941-45. I was assigned to the New York City branch of the
Employers’ Liability Assurance Corporation, and was employed
there from 1938 to 1941, when I entered the service as a first
lieutenant. I was separated in 1946 as a major and was hired
by the insurance firm of Louis J. Aieta & Company in New York
City. In 1953 I was made a partner. So much for the business
aspect of my life to date.

The three signal events in my life have been my marriage to
Natalie Trundy of Boston in 1939 and the birth of our two daugh-
ters in 1940 and 1944 respectively. They have been my in-
spiration and my blessings; and in them I feel I have achieved the
quintessence.

Natalie, Jr., has set out on a theatrical career, and has en-
joyed unusual success for her tender years, having made two
films, “Careless Years” and “Monte Carlo.” In addition, she has
had featured roles in four Broadway plays and numerous tele-
vision dramas. She is in her senior year at Professional Children’s
School.

Beverly, too, has been in television, but has not indicated the
same predilection for the theatre as her elder sister. She attends
Marymount School in New York City.

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

My hobbies are golf and bridge, but I am not in the least pro-
ficient in either. This does not, however, detract from the
pleasure I enjoy in these diversions. I have made but one trip
abroad and found Rome particularly interesting, Sorrento, par-
ticularly beautiful, Lisbon, particularly clean, and Paris, particu-
larly commercial.

In politics, 1 started out, under the tutelage of our Class Secre-
tary, being an avowed Democrat; couldn’t live with it, and be-
came an equally avowed Republican. Now I once again am un-
sure, and am beginning to vacillate. Perhaps I should talk it over
with Donal Sullivan.

In conclusion, I feel that he is rich indeed who has tasted but
a sip of happiness. By this standard, I am a man of wealth and
am grateful to God for His beneficence.

punticaTions: A few minor case reports, etc. In various medical journals.

ON the day of graduation I was late to church and had a hard
time finding a seat; later in the same day my family recognized
me with my back turned, from Row EE in the stadium, by m
bald spot. These two attributes have continued for the past
quarter century and I have never since been late to anything,
nor have I grown another stick of hair.

This naturally led to medical school and a subsequent wander-
ing course through various Boston and Rochester, Minnesota,
hospitals and institutions until I was seized by the AUS and sent
to Santa Barbara for military duty. The next three years, the
first three of my second daughter’s life (alas for early paternal
influence) were spent in Africa, Sicily, Italy, France, Germany
(and after the war for a week, England) pursuing glory with the
Eleventh Evacuation Hospital. This netted me the Bronze Star
Medal and seven campaign stars (you could use a silver one
for five bronze ones) and one invasion spearhead for my
European Theatre Campaign Medal ribbon.

In 1946 I started practising pediatrics in Santa Barbara where
my family had settled for the duration of the war. This was a
wise and sound move and I foresee no possibility of change. As

well as practising pediatrics, I get a lot of fun out of various
community activities, which keep me busy.

Vacations, since the girls have been old enough, and until
they get too old, have been and will continue to be largely ex-
ploration of the West. Great national forests lie west of Ded-
ham. Hobbies seem to be things that doctors recommend for
old people. I am forty-five and I read a lot. My family, wife and
two adolescent girls, cater to my wants and please my heart.

WHAT started out as an academic career somehow got derailed
into government service. Then a tour of duty in diplomacy led
in due course to the life of a commuter, plying back and forth
to New York City shoulder to shoulder with the organization
men and the denizens of Madison Avenue. Nevertheless, there
has been some measure of consistency in all this. For the quarter
century since college I have been concerned in one way or
another with international affairs. During most of it I have shut-
tled between Cambridge, New York and Washington, with side
trips to Europe, the Middle East, the Far East and South America.
But there has also been some venturing into the American hin-
terland, including a brief spell of teaching at the University of
Louisville, on which I look back with pleasant memories.
This is my third inning at the Council on Foreign Relations.
In between have come two periods, totalling a little over a decade,
of service in the Department of State. After a certain number
of years in government one looks to the greener fields of “pri-
vate enterprise” where one can speak with a looser tongue and
write with a freer pen. After a certain number of years outside
one begins to miss the sense of participation, minimal though it
may be, in the course of history. I have tried to find a judicious
mixture of the two, and have not been dissatisfied with the re-
sults (though it must be conceded that, from the viewpoint of

[165 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

other members of the family, being uprooted every few years
has not always seemed a reason for satisfaction).

The experience in the State Department has included being
mixed up in, with varying degrees of responsibility, wartime
planning for the postwar settlement, the armistice negotiations
with Hungary, Rumania and Bulgaria, the sessions of the Council
of Foreign Ministers on the Italian and Balkan peace treaties, the
Paris Conference of 1946, the Danube Conference at Belgrade
in 1948, the evolution of U.S. policy of aid to Yugoslavia, and re-
lations with the U.S.S.R. and its European satellites in the late
Stalin Period. I had the good fortune to be enjoying a “sabbatical
year” at the National War College during the turmoil of the
changeover from Democrats to Republicans in 1953, returning
when things had settled down a bit to serve for the next couple
of years on the Department’s Policy Planning Staff, then a well-
balanced group of Harvard and Princeton men. This working-
level contact with the making of national strategy in the rarefied
air of the upper reaches of the Department and the National Se-
curity Council was frequently stimulating, occasionally boring,
and sometimes frightening.

At the Council on Foreign Relations, I have been engaged
partly in discussions and writing, partly in guiding the discussions
and writings of others. We hope that these various activities
are contributing to the application of expertise and wisdom in
the conduct of U.S. foreign policy, but probably no judgment
will be possible on whether this is actually so, even after the
next war or the next election. For three years (1946-49) I wrote
the Council’s annual survey of American foreign policy, since
carried on by Richard P. Stebbins, ’33. The most recent effort
is a book on U.S. policy in the Middle East, published this year.

On the more personal side, 1 pursue with my family a more or
less stereotyped exurban existence, but as a non-joiner and with-
out quite keeping up to the established norms. Still, we go through
Little League, Poison Ivy League, League of Women Votcrs,
and the rest. I still play a lot of tennis (club varicty) and have
hot yet taken up golf. I have an affinity for lost causes (freedom
for Fastern Furope, the New York Giants, Elarvard football, and
the Democratic Party in Westchester County among others),
but still have hopes for world peace and the Class of 733.

AFTER being cast adrift by Harvard in the middle of a de-
pression, with a degree in mechanical engineering, I floundered
around for three years unable to get any kind of work except as a
substitute teacher in our local school system. Finally, in the fall
of 1936, I received a permanent appointment as a teacher of
general science at the Roberts Junior High School, Medford, at
the staggering salary of $1700. per annum. I advanced steadily
through the ranks until now I teach physics in the high school,
head the Science Department, and am a submaster in charge of
scheduling the entire school of 1700 pupils and ninety teachers.
Along the way, I picked up a Master’s in Education from Tufts
by attending classes afternoons, evenings and summers. To
supplement my income I have taught mathematics at Lincoln
Technical Institute for the past twelve years.

I am most happy with my present status in life. I have a
wonderful wife, Mary Louise, a registered nurse, and two fine
daughters attending high school. By living conservatively we
enjoy our modest surroundings and look forward to spending a
month each summer at the beach in Wells, Maine. If I had it to
do over, I wouldn’t change a thing that I have experienced during
the past quarter of a century.

I have found that the requirements for a happy life are: good
health, an understanding wife, satisfaction with one’s work, and
living within one’s means.

SAP’S a-running!” A neighbor shouted to me while I shivered
my way homeward from a trip to town in the farm truck, one
day last spring. It seemed too cold for sugaring but several taps
WERE “a-runnin!” along the way and there was no doubt another
farming season had rolled around for Maplewood.

Since the long planned adventure into a closer relationship with
mother nature, seven sapping seasons, seven haying seasons, seven
harvests and seven winters, as the redskins count, have passed in
regular rhythm. Each year a cyclic repetition of the preceding,
including the slipping market prices. The only noticeable change,
not exactly in the rustic cycle or the economic seesaw, is the
deepening tinge of gray in my beard, and other keratinous fila-
ments sparsely flourishing on a slightly elevated site. Scarcely any-
one expects to see dark brown natural pigment or an overcrowded
population there again, regardless of soil fertility or farm pro-
grams, or seasons.

Farming has many unique compensations, deep satisfactions,
and modes of individual expressions, absolutely free for the most
part of the twentieth century hypertension. For the individual,
I often wonder whether societies properly define the word pro-
gress. In spite of this general emotional tone I occasionally find
myself, while astride a faithful Fordson, yearning for the challenge
of some cluttered up laboratory. ‘Then, too, like many an old
agricultural sourdough, after a day’s chase of a herd of runaway
heifers, I swear that this will be my last year of active operation.
Pll definitely chase those acrid odors of disarranged benches in-
stead.

When spring and the magic cry of “sap’s a-runnin!” sounds its
reveille and the anticipation of another bout with nature on a
vital everyday level stimulates enthusiasm anew in synchronized
pace with deciduous green, another year starts to slip into an
integration within agricultural limits, as certainly as ice is de-
scriptive of New Hampshire January.

After leaving Harvard College in 1933, I fully intended to enter
a graduate school for a doctorate in biochemistry, and did in fact
enter Columbia under Hans Clarke. Realistic economics and a bit

[ 169 ]

of travel altered plans in a definite manner, and industrial employ-
ment won the toss. After marriage and the arrival of a daughter
the course for a few years was relatively set.

It was while in Norwalk, Connecticut, that my path first
crossed agricultural circles to any degree. What started to be a
country home with a minor interest in gardening and a few
domesticated animals evoluted into a commercial poultry farm.
However, the lure of the laboratory was strong enough to cause
a relocation to the middle west. . |

My chemical career took me about the country a bit and in-
cluded residences in or near the following places: Elizabeth, New
Jersey, New York City, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Atlanta, Georgia,
Norwalk, and Stamford, Connecticut, Milwaukee, and Princeton,
New Jersey. .A couple of cruises included some part of South
America, the West Indies, and the Western Coast of the United
States, via Panama. However, no spot affords the wonderful
panoramic view visible right here at Maplewood, Franklin, New
Hampshire.

Constance, my daughter, now sixteen and attending school in
Connecticut, after preliminary education in Franklin Grammar
Schools, has aspirations of attending Radcliffe or Wellesley in a
year or so, but having no son, at present, I regret there will be no
family representative at Harvard in the near future.

Hunting and fishing are unparalleled in our vicinity. Pheasants
and deer abound, and it is not infrequent that a pair of pheasants
are bagged from the back doorstep. Any old friends who are so

inclined are cordially invited to include a hunting trip at Maple-
wood, in season.

I RECALL thinking in college days that by the Twenty-fifth
Reunion my affairs would surely be wrapped up and I would
be practically an old man. I took a rather jaundiced view then
of the philosophy of “The last of life, for which the first was
made.” But here I am feeling that the coming decades can be
the prime of life offering the greatest challenges, opportunities
and satisfactions. Note: I said “can be” in the last sentence
and not “will be”; for it ill becomes one to be complacent and
tempt fate in this uneasy age of cataclysmic changes and wars,
Sputniks and auto accidents.

The two principal phases of my life in which “The Class” can
possibly take an interest, if it takes any at all, are my career in
education and my family.

Taking them up chronologically, I began to teach in 1936
quite accidentally, and as I thought for a short period, at the
Midland School—a boys’ preparatory school near Santa Bar-
bara, California. Paul Squibb, ’17, was founder and headmaster
of this vigorous, stimulating and self-reliant school. Living with
the boys in simple even rough ranch style, I enjoyed tremen-
dously both teaching and coaching sports. I also learned by
doing and by example much more, I think, about the art of
teaching than I have since acquired in numerous courses in
education. Experience may be the best school, but the Midland
School was a great experience for me for seven years.

After an interim during 1943-45 in the Army Artillery, I
resumed teaching at the Laguna Blanca School, a country day
school in Santa Barbara. In 1951 my wife and I had the oppor-
tunity to acquire the Howard School in Santa Barbara. This
is an elementary day and boarding school for boys and girls
now in its 46th year. Present enrollment of the school is about
eighty children, a number that seems top capacity. It is a pro-
prietary school — that is we own it ourselves and run it without
aid, hindrance or supervision of any board. We do, though,
have the very great help of a fine staff of teachers and of loyal
and interested parents.

My educational philosophy is the straight-forward one that

[171]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

children first of all should be happy in school and that the
are happiest if disciplined, busy and stimulated. We to
achieve these goals at our small family-type school, and further-

more we try to stress such old-fashioned precepts as good man-
ners and scholarship.

I could not run the school without the twenty-four-hour a
day help of my wife who is co-director with me. This brings
up the second phase of my life referred to above, ie. my family.
I married Eileen May Wilcock (Peggy), who was here on a
visit from England, in 1939 in Santa Barbara. She is still an
English citizen and to me typifies. the best English traits. We
have twins, Hugh and Barbara, born in Southampton, England,
in 1947. It is fun for us to have our twins at our own school,

and we shall miss them when they go on (we hope) to prepar-
atory schools and colleges.

So much up to the present—as to the future, when any of
you come through Santa Barbara, do stop in and see us at school.

agents; articles and exhibitions and lectures on techniques involved, and
the major medical publications and medical meetings.

ON looking in the mirror this cold December morning, I see a
slightly (as I naively say) over-weight, fifty-year-old individual,
the remnant of the crew-cut still present, slightly salty at the
temples. The mustache is there, but it takes a few minutes and
some familiarity with the physiognomy to locate it.

“Twenty-five years and what do you get?” I ask the image.

“What do you expect?” was the reply. “You have been a
doctor working and bringing up a family like everybody else.”

I went to Harvard, then to Harvard Medical School, and after
five years there took my degree in 1938. After Medical School
and an internship in Chicago, I returned to Boston and joined
the University in the Hygiene Department under Arlie Bock.
During my academic work, I did a good deal of fencing and
taught at various schools throughout New England and it was
through this that I met my wife, Victoria Maxwell, who was a
student at Wheaton. Victoria, in the meantime, took her degree
from Tufts Medical, and in 42, along with everyone else, I went
into the Army.

During the early years of practice after the war, and working
again in the Hygiene Department, I became interested in de-
vising methods of testing medications by applying mathematical
and statistical techniques to subjective variables. Since then, have
had twenty-five or more publications in scientific journals on
these subjects.

“What is the situation today?”

“Well, you might say it is very good. My professional life
has been very gratifying. It seems the older I get the more re-
sponsibilities I take on, and it keeps me on the go most of the
time. The problem now is to cut down on the practice, as with
the growth of the University Health Services at Harvard I’ve
taken an increasingly active part. Now I have a full faculty
appointment as physician to the law school and its faculty as
well as to the University Health Services under Dr. Dana L.
Farnsworth.”

“Where do you find a respite from all this activity?”

“At my home in Winchester, in sports and travel, and in grow-
ing an orchid or two.”

[173]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933
“How about Mrs. Cass?”

“She’s an M.D., too, and is acting director of the Peter Bent
Brigham Hospital. She was associate director for five years
before that, and was active for some time in the Massachusetts
Department of Public Health.”

“T should think with all this you two would have very little
time together.”

“On the contrary, we have a good deal of time together and
spend five or six weeks in travel each year, usually Europe. We
took our boy, Lee, and our daughter, Vicky, on a tour of the
country a year ago to give them an idea of our own country.
We always enjoy traveling together. Lee, who is now fifteen,
is working hard at Belmont Hill School and has high hopes of
making Harvard. Vicky, twelve, is at Concord Academy. Lee
and I do a lot of skeet and trap shooting, but ’m not in the same
league with him; he is the Massachusetts State and New England
Junior Champion. Vicky is mad about riding and the trophies
are beginning to accumulate there, too. In the meantime, Dr.
Victoria, who keeps up her piano, is interested in flower arrang-
ing, and she’s taken several prizes in the annual show of the
Massachusetts Horticultural Society. And this year has been of
special interest to us all, as we have Klaus Reuter, a German ex-
change student, living with us while he spends a year at Win-
chester High. Well, I guess that’s about all I can think of, except
that Vickie and I are sports car enthusiasts.”

All in all, it has been a pretty good twenty-five years for me
since graduating from Harvard.

HARVARD BROTHER: Anthony B. Cassedy, 24.

occuPATION: Mercantile business.
MEMBER OF: Harvard Clubs of New York City, Boston; Fairfield Beach Club.

EXCEPT for a brief start at investment banking, my business
career has been devoted to consumer goods marketing. The
products have included beer, soap, wine, razor blades and food
specialties. The jobs have run the gamut from salesman to mar-
keting vice-president. The employers have varied from adver-
tising agency to soap producer. From whatever aspect, the
business of inducing the consumer to pick one’s product off the
retail shelf has been a fascinating one. My gainful employment
was interrupted by three years in the Navy, most of it as com-
manding officer of an L.S.T. in the Sicilian, Italian and Nor-
mandy operations.

The chief concern underlying all the foregoing activity has
been the raising of a family. This project was put on a sound
footing early in the game by convincing a patient and cour-
ageous, though somewhat gullible, girl that life with me would
be bliss. The tangible result of that happy deception is that
child No. 1 is about to become a surgical nurse, No. 2 is a mem-
ber of the Harvard Class of 1961, and No. 3 is beating his way
through secondary school. As to the amount of bliss generated
in the process, it has not been deemed prudent to make penetrat-
ing inquiries on that score.

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

PUBLICATIONS: Several patents, aS cO-inventor with associates, on synthetic
rubber and vinyl sulfone treatment of textiles; one of four authors of an
article on synthetic rubber in a trade journal.

MY work since getting my doctorate in chemistry in 1938 has
been confined to industrial research and development. Two years
with Republic Steel Corporation in Cleveland were profitable
and pleasant but when I got the chance to return to organic
chemistry I jumped at it and came here to help develop a process
of producing synthetic rubber in large quantities. I had a small
part in one of many crucial operations here at home that helped
win the war but I got a lot of satisfaction out of it. We are still
looking for better synthetic rubber as well as other improvements.
We always shall be, I guess, and that is one of the things that
makes this kind of work so much fun. There is always another
road down which to explore.

Shortly before I finished my graduate work my brother married
a Cleveland girl and I met the bride’s sister. It did not take me
very long to realize that I need look no further for the girl I
wanted and in 1940 we were married. We have a thirteeen-year-
old son who is rapidly approaching six feet plus. Because of him,
both my wife and I have been enthusiastic Scouters, first as den
mother and committee chairman in the Cub pack and then as
member of the Troop Committee. This last summer our boy was
one of the 50,000 Scouts that filled the slopes of Valley Forge
with the tents of the Scout Jamboree. We attended the opening
ceremonies and the sight of over 50,000 teen-aged kids in that big
natural bowl was a blood-tingling thrill I shall never forget.

Scouting, to my mind, is an avocation with no superior for a
man who has any liking for boys.

SOMETHING like this Twenty-fifth Reunion really makes one

stop and think. For mine has not been a very exciting career to

write about. I liked my work after leaving college and have re-

mained with the same concern ever since. The fact is, I still like

it, so there isn’t much likelihood of change.

The political bug bit me once and thinking back it was quite
an interesting period. However, as Young Republicans our efforts
were not too successful in the 1930's, although we were as earnest
and dedicated a group as anyone can imagine. World War II
blew the whole shebang sky high and that was that.

Family-wise, I was a late starter but with a six-year-old son
find that I can’t settle back in the old easy chair. And looking
forward, don’t see much likelihood of doing so for quite some
time.

I love a game of bridge, fishing when there is an opportunity,
but gave up golf as a lost cause. The six-year-old may revive it,
however. All in all, here is an average family man, but one to
whom life has been good.

HAVE been in the real estate business since 1933, except for a
couple of years during World War II spent in such tropic isles as
the Russells, New Georgia and Funa Futi.

At the present time, with a real estate operation, two small
developments and our five children—the oldest in college in
Denver, the next at the University of Michigan and the other
three nearby — we manage to keep occupied. An example will be
the week of our Twenty-fifth Reunion during which our oldest
daughter graduates from the University of Colorado, Sylvia from
Concord Academy and our youngest, Jimmie, from the Charles

River School, and the one golf tourney I can’t miss takes place at
the local links.

MY wife threatens that if I don’t get to this soon, she will do it for
me. To avoid the possibility of having her interpretation of my
quarter century spread upon the record, I am finally brought to
the point of trying to distill the flavor of the receding years into
a cup suited to the present orgy of self-revelation. I hope that,
in doing so, I shall have the strength to avoid cute remarks about
the children and remarks, however, subtly worded, that should
properly be subscribed “(Advt.).”

The attached information that I am a consultant, and live and
work in Washington, might evoke in some the image of five
percenters and influence peddling. Unfortunately, I have no

[178 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

influence to peddle, and have never been offered five percent of
anything more desirable than a dinner check, so I have to do it
the hard way as a working consultant. I earn a precarious living
by developing and expounding theories of public utility regula-
tion, which I sometimes have to defend on the witness stand
against the attacks of highly paid lawyers, who have been hired
to confuse, confute and confound me. There must be an easier
way, but I haven’t found it. At any rate it keeps me alert. [All
right, dammit, (Advt.)]

To conserve my depleting supply of sanity in this merry round
I maintain, at greater expense than I can afford, a family cruising
sailboat on the Chesapeake. I have trained my loved ones into a
competent, though occasionally mutinous, crew, and we have a
fine time. My wife, in fact, is such an energetic and versatile
hand as to lead the owner of a local boatyard to ask me (after I
had paid him for gold-plating the bottom), “What do you do
aboard here? Just wear the captain’s hat and shout orders?”

I spent the war years, which seem so long ago now, in various
small anti-submarine ships, convoying rusty merchantmen and
chasing elusive submarines from Brazil to the Philippines, I at-
tained the rank of commander, which I still hold, I suppose my
only future in the Navy would be as laundry officer, Third Naval
District, or shore patrol officer, Basin Street, “Kiss me Hardy and
I die happy.”

Now that I have got rolling, this threatens to be too long. I
have been told that no verbal portrait of a man is complete with-
out a catalog of his likes and dislikes, so I am going to allow my-
self the luxury of listing some of mine, in the certain and rather
pleasant knowledge that they are of no interest to anyone but me.
I am very fond of sailing, listening to music and being admired
by beautiful women, and detest cocktail parties, bubble gum and
all forms of mass communication, including advertising. In read-
ing this over I see that I have omitted the customary nostalgic
references to college days —oh well.

’
’ 05,

THE practice of medicine was inevitable for me. My father,
grandfather and great-grandfather were all doctors. Despite
parental warnings of the vicissitudes of doctoring, I chose to
follow in the footsteps of my ancestors. |

Harvard Medical School and various internships and residen-
cies in Boston started me on the path to becoming a fashionable
young specialist in obstetrics and gynecology. Herr Hitler de-
toured me for a few years during which time the “big medical
brass” erroneously conceived of me as a brain surgeon. A tour
of duty through North Africa, Italy and France with the 21st
General Hospital convinced me that the “big brass” was wrong.
Safely home in 1945, | resumed medical practice, no longer
young, not particularly fashionable, but “happy as a clam at
high tide.”

Married to the prettiest nurse at the Massachusetts General
Hospital — we are the harried parents of two boys and two
girls with all the problems involved. School lessons, piano les-
sons, dancing lessons, trumpet lessons — but most of all the les-
son of living — of which we so inadequately must be the teach-
ers.

My hobbies are many but I have insufficient time for any of

[ 180 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

them. Golf: complete frustration but perpetual hope. Fish-
ing: trout and salmon are my favorites with New Brunswick
waters when time permits. Hunting: deer in Maine and ducks
on Cape Cod. Sports cars: my present pride is a beautiful silver
Porsche coupe.

THE Depression struck while I was a Harvard undergraduate.
After floundering around in odd jobs I returned to get a degree
in chemistry. I left the country and added to my academic record
what corresponds to a Master’s at the Swiss University of
Lausanne. The instruction there was in the French language,
German being used in Zurich and other northern Swiss universi-
ties. I also attended a short while at Heidelberg, Germany; the
entire city escaped bombing.

[181 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

Before I settled down to struggling with problems in atmos-
pheric research, I visited Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo, Buenos
Aires, Santiago and other places in South America. Juan Perén
was then strutting across the Argentine, if not the general Latin
American, political scene.

During the Second World War, I had the opportunity to see
how they live “down under.” The Antipodes were surprising in
their friendly faces that they turned to me as well as their lack
of slums and servants. They all do their domestic work!

But every time I return to California I realize that this
“Southern” part of the state is in a class apart: variety and vitality,
progress and profits, sunshine and smog.

I am sorry not to be able to report offspring in prospect as
potential “Harvard material”; on the contrary the family circle
was reduced in April last year by the passing of my father at the
age of almost eighty-one. I shall have to stop dallying if I am to
have an heir. Perhaps in the future, with my increased leisure,
I shall be able to give my attention and substance more generously
to my quasi-alma mater and renew almost forgotten friendships.

Tennis, golf, swimming and chess are my most active hobbies.
The sculpturing that I tried to learn at the Royal Academy of
Fine Arts at Rome enabled me to do a few portrait busts, but I
seem short of patience now at the weeks of carving, as I seem
short of breath with the stiff tennis adversary. Perhaps I am just
growing older!

With sympathy for my European friends, I follow the struggle
of the people and the clergy of Catholic Hungary and Poland
against a tyranny which seeks to engulf us, too. Just a year ago in
Budapest the putative “brain-washed” youth defied death and

chose Lenin’s “opiate of the people” instead of his ‘““Workers’
Paradise.” With such courage there still is hope!

me to IBM and electronic accounting which was to stand me in
good stead in the postwar years.

LOOKING back on twenty-five years and forward to another

twenty-five years, I find that I have two predominant feelings:

(1) a profound feeling of thanksgiving for all the blessings that

[ 185 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

life has brought me; (2) an eager and enthusiastic readiness for
the challenges and changes that lie ahead.

I count as my greatest blessings a devoted, loving wife and
two gifted and fun-loving daughters. They have brought me
untold joy. Not the least of my blessings is my work which I
enjoy tremendously. It encompasses (a) the development and
manufacturing of packaging, specialized machinery and unique
new medical and scientific equipment (including the heart-lung
oxygenator used in heart operations); (b) the production of let-
ter-press, lithographic, dry offset, rotogravure and flexographic
printing; (c) international trade, Primarily my duties are creative
in nature and involve long range planning and policy decisions
rather than day-to-day operations.

I thoroughly enjoy the human relations aspect of business and
am constantly impressed with the genuine kindness of all the
people with whom I come in contact. This impression of how
genuinely kind people are is reinforced by my business trips,
some of which take me to Latin America where I find that de-
spite language differences the fundamental good will of people
and their desire to communicate it to others overcome all ob-
stacles. .

Socially, we lead essentially a quiet life. At Linden Park we
go rowing (spring and fall) on our little pond, and go skating
on it come winter; we take walks in the woods, and informally
play baseball, basketball, football and tennis. Summers we spend
at the old family home in Hull, Massachusetts, doing a little
swimming and golfing, and enjoying a very informal relaxed
way of life. All year around we read constantly, go to the
theatre and have fun with our children and friends. We still
have season tickets for the Harvard football games and continue
to have great enthusiasm for Harvard football and for the sound
educational policies which stand behind it. Occasionally we
travel to Florida and the Caribbean and as the children get older
we look forward to European and world travel.

If I were to boil my activities down to the simplest terms,
I think I would find that I am first an analyst and secondly an
organizer of personnel and material for effective action. As a
result of this I occasionally find myself organizing drives for
funds or heading up other charitable or educational endeavors.

[ 186 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

I have found some of my greatest satisfaction in this work. As
chairman of the Planning and Program Development Committee
of the Thayer Academy Trustees, I have just headed a successful
fund drive for $400,000 and am now supervising the building
of an auditorium, additional classrooms and new science facilities
from the funds. I am a firm believer in industry support for
secondary school education and am currently serving as the
trustee representative with a group of private school educators
who are undertaking to effectuate such support.

As trustee of the Turner Free Library, I am seeking to de-
velop a new broad concept of enlarged library service in my
home community. I am also finding much pleasure in service
on the Prize and Scholarship Committee of the Old Colony
Harvard Club. |

As to the next twenty-five or more years, I am not one of
those who “view with alarm.” If this were so, my studies in
history at Harvard would have been largely wasted, for the one
thing that such study should teach is that life consists of a con-
stant struggle, a constant series of changes and a constant adapta-
tion to new conditions, all of which usually come out all right.
“This too will pass” and “the important thing is not that we have
problems but how we meet them” are two good pieces of advice
given me early in life by my parents. They are good guide posts
of which to avail one’s self if momentarily things seem dark.

Yes, I am thankful for all that has gone before and I look
forward to what is ahead —the children growing up, new and
different business problems, the challenges and opportunities of
middle and old age, the implications of the space age — with
equanimity, confidence and enthusiasm.

THE time comes in the life of every living member of Harvard
1933, as it will to those in later classes, when he should take stock
of what he has been able to contribute to life and what life has
given to him. The Twenty-fifth Reunion may well be the peak
or near-peak moment in the lives of college graduates, a moment
when many still enjoy considerable robustness of health, some
maturity of judgment, and extensive exposure to the lights and
shadows of mortal life. If it does nothing else, a quarter-century
of post-college experience tends to breed thousands of philoso-
hers.

/ Everything considered, life has been most kind to me and I am
somewhat chagrined to admit that probably I have not contributed
nearly as much as I should have to make this world a better place.
Age properly begets humility. Despite the harmful influences of
depression and war, which have been common to our Class, I
remain essentially an optimist, hoping for a braver, brighter world
both here and in the life to come. |

My life principally has been devoted to the U.S. Navy and to
the U.S. Naval Academy. It has been a rewarding experience to

have been associated with the education, both scholastic and ath-
letic, of our Annapolis Midshipmen for eighteen years. Perhaps
one of the secrets of keeping young in spirt is to work with these
fine young men, whose age never changes, class after class. My
primary duties at the Naval Academy include teaching naval
history and some of the great books of world literature, together
with coaching Plebe cross-country and track. Our hill-and-dalers
have compiled an 84-10 record, while that of the track teams has
been a little better, Other activities include authorship of books
and articles and duties as associate editor of the Naval Institute
monthly magazine, Proceedings.

Am still active in the Organized Naval Reserve and after
twenty-four years of commissioned service hold the rank of
captain. In World War II, the challenging duties of first lieuten-
ant and damage control officer of the Essex-class carrier, U.S.S.
Randolph, provided useful combat experience.

Of far more significance is my family. My wife, Grace, is one
of the finest ladies alive, a person of almost limitless talent and
skill, boundless energy and enthusiasm, and as fine a guiding star
as one could have. Daughter Vickey is a junior at University of
Maryland; Susan, a student at Annapolis Junior High. Son Bill
is a seaman, U.S.N.R., currently at Naval Academy Preparatory
School, Bainbridge, preparing for Annapolis.

My work is also my hobby, although we do find time to con-
tinue attention to Boston Red Sox history and seek to make this
collection of material as complete as possible. One of the recent
highlights of this Red Sox interest was being photographed with
Ted Williams on the Red Sox bench during a game with the
Baltimore Orioles.

One of the keenest pleasures that lies ahead is to read the reports
of all other classmates and, better still, to swap memories, ideas
and experiences with as many as possible at Cambridge in June.

I honor with reverence those of my own family who have died,
father, mother and first son. And I shall ever remember with
affection our classmates, particularly those of the Naval R.O.T.C.
Unit, who died in the war that we and millions of others might
live in a better and happier world. We of Harvard 1933 must
never forget our debt to them.

MY last act of procrastination was the making of a Chickadee
Pudding. DZ remarked (facetiously, I hope) that if I could put
together a mess like that, I should have no difficulty in recording
my life history for the Twenty-fifth Anniversary Report.

In 1933 the world’s largest sandpaper company was looking
for a clerk in its Credit Department. Recognizing the value I
could bring to such a position, I applied. Twenty-five years later

o
they acknowledge that I was the best invoice-sorter they ever

had.
[191 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

Full of love, with the future as a paper-shuffler assured, what
better could a man do but get married. DZ liked the idea, too,
and we have lived happily ever since. For awhile there seemed
to be little Clarks all over the place. Three boys first, and the
fourth just the opposite. The Clark boys and tax collectors seem
to have most of Dad’s money. Robin (she’s the gal) is appar-
ently content with his heart. Our joint conclusion — Education
of children is the greatest struggle in life. A very deep sympathy
for our parents and what they had to endure.

We have always been active on our “time off.” Skiing was
an obsession for years. It still would be but for the Russian
snow or something which seems to attack the muscles and nerv-
ous system. We talk a wonderful “schuss” though, and have
never been more expert in our living room than we are today.

Striper fishing at Martha’s Vineyard is a family favorite. We
work long and hard at it. Highly recommended for the aging
who don’t mind battling the wind, surf, rain and sand in the
middle of the night.

In 1942 I decided the sandpaper industry could struggle along
without me while I attended to other matters. I wrote an il-
luminating account of my fine education, experience and personal
qualifications to the Navy. I also suggested that an interview
might be of mutual benefit. The date set was a particularly pro-
pitious one. It was the time the recruiting office was being
moved from Pine Street to Church or vice-versa. My voluminous
record was neither here nor there, so I sat naked in the examining
room for an hour trying to reconstruct it. A brilliant start for
a Navy career. The following day the company told me we
were going to manufacture ignition parts for Navy aircraft —
and that’s what I did for the next three years.

Never did I expect to be bending book and elbow again along
the Charles, but fate and fortune willed it thus. Hamilton was
my address eighteen years later in the emporium across the
river. Thirteen weeks there as a P.B.E. in the Advanced Man-
agement Program was the experience of a lifetime. (If you have
the chance, don’t miss it.) |

My life in business, except for the war years, has been mostly
in the field of general administration. Much to do with person-
nel and office policy formation and organization planning and

[ 192 ]

control. Add activity on the company board of directors and
executive committee plus board work with the TB Association
and the Albany Hospital, and one has-a fair picture of how I
spend my waking hours.

Variety is the spice of life. It’s nice to have all three! Inci-
dentally, Chickadee Pudding is for the birds. Recipe free on

JUST before our Twentieth Reunion I had a sore throat, and a
well-meaning practitioner gave me a couple of shots of penicillin
in appropriate places. Three weeks later my throat was fine, but
I could hardly walk. When I hobbled to the Reunion, I figured
I could get considerable free medical advice from numerous
classmates in the profession. I met fourteen doctors — but so
help me, the first thirteen were psychiatrists and the fourteenth
a veterinarian.

With such a preponderance of psyche-searchers in our class,
anyone would be risking a fate worse than death to bare his soul
in this Silver Jubilee Report. If I were to write my true feelings
about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, no one would
believe me. If I were to write something they would believe, I
wouldn’t believe it myself.

Suffice it to say, therefore, that I have a jewel of a wife, three
gems of daughters and a brick of a son. After twenty-three
happy years of association with the Boston Herald and seven-
teen concurrent years as an associate professor at Northeastern
University (with time out for winning the war with my torrid
little typewriter), I traded my busy double life for a single very
satisfactory exccutive position with the Boston Post. The paper
was in bad shape when I joined it, but I ruined it completely,
and on October 5, 1956, the Post joined the Boston Transcript
in the limbo of lost newspapers.

Two weeks later, having decided I could no longer afford the
luxury of romping in the journalistic vineyards, I ventured into
the field of finance as assistant to the president of Keystone Cus-
todian Funds. At the sight of a ticker tape I start talking about
stock funds, bond funds, special purpose funds, estate planning
and a hundred other items that have made mutual funds the
modern method of investing. And at the drop of a cherry in
a cocktail glass, I rue the fact it took me so long to learn that
there is considerable merit to leading a relatively normal life.

IN June of 1933, my Father and the Class of 1908 graciously

blended the pleasures of their Twenty-fifth Reunion with those

of our graduation. I can still remember it as quite a week, which

even in those days called for a couple of days recuperation. After

that a year or so with the Whiting Milk Company seemed to have
provided enough earthly goods to start a modest home and Marian
and I figured we could keep the wolf from the door, though I
guess we didn’t give that particular phase of life too much
thought. Anyway, a couple of more years convinced me that
there must be easier ways to make a living,

[ 196 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

In 1936 I joined the United Shoe Machinery Corporation at
Boston, Massachusetts. Most of my work has been at our Boston
office, with just enough traveling about the country to be in-
teresting and pleasant for a guy who loves his home and family.

On looking back a little, it seems that our hobbies, interests,
etc., have to a great degree been stimulated by our boys, Peter
and Nathan, which is probably normal. The boys are five years
apart in age, which is just about right to insure a double dose of a
great many activities about the home town. After Marian’s five
years as a Cub Scout Den Mother set the pace, I spent a few as
Scoutmaster. Those were the years when we relearned the joys
of camping and we still take an occasional fling at it. Then there
was the astounding discovery that there existed a Sunday School
that small boys would attend because they wanted to. This led
to some participation in the affairs of the Unitarian Church in
West Newton. The Church somehow survived those years, and
now Pete at least makes up for my shortcomings in that direction.

A few years ago the Boy Scouts of America made the mistake
of asking me to help teach Scouts to make bows and arrows. It
was probably unavoidable that this should lead to addiction to field
archery and bow hunting. The family outings that we have
enjoyed at field archery tournaments have to some extent eased
any twinges of conscience I should have felt for sneaking away
on annual bow hunting trips. Besides, Nathan has a cabinet full
of trophies.

As of now, Pete has made a good start on his freshman year at
Harvard. We are as thrilled to see him playing in the Band as
he is. He has spent his last several summers as a camp counselor,
teaching archery. Nathan is in his last year of junior high school
and is well beyond the stage of asking, “Do you have to go to
high school?” He is our outdoor boy, and should become the
only Eagle Scout of our family. The three of us owe Marian more
than she will ever know.

REVIEWING the past twenty-five years from my commuter
locale of Westchester suburbia, the record seems mundane, un-
exciting and commonplace, save perhaps for the war years.
The practice of law in Boston after Harvard Law School was
interrupted by five years in the Navy, and then followed several
years as house counsel for two large textile companies which
brought me in 1948 from Boston to New York to work and
from Dover, Massachusetts, to Westchester to live. Since 1952
I have been in real estate and corporate finance with Hubbard,
Westervelt & Mottelay in New York.

As to family, we run to boys, four in all, ages eight to fifteen
years, and it is just possible that the eldest, Peter, will be at
Harvard to welcome us back for our Thirtieth, We have spent
some good fun vacations together both at the sea shore and in
the mountains. The boys seem to prefer such sports as camp-
ing, swimming and skiing, and so skiing has become a hobby of
mine. Some of the best fun over the past few years has resulted
from trying to keep up with the young while running nearly
all the precipitous ski slopes on the eastern seaboard. In addition
to tennis (no golf), I have found a little gardening a remarkable
antidote for the pressure of business life, Perhaps my continued

[ 198 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

activity since college as an officer in the Naval Reserve should
be mentioned in the hobby category. It definitely represents a
significant part of my adult life.

Travel, particularly in the Pacific during the war, more than
once turned up a friendly classmate or two, often in time of
need. In this regard special appreciation goes to Clary Pell for
flying me home from Pearl Harbor under trying circumstances
at the war’s end, and to Albie Pratt for perseverance beyond the
call of friendship: for more than ten months pending my return
Albie kept intact in the South Pacific, despite acute shortages
of same, one entire case of potable whiskey. (The fact that he
has since served with distinction in Washington as Assistant Sec-
retary of the Navy is, for me, sheer anti-climax.)

Politically, I am a rather confused, liberal Republican. Just
what do the Republicans stand for or want that the Democrats
are not also in favor of? And the reverse would appear to be
true. However, neither Republicans nor Democrats seem im-
portant in this new Sputnik age. The unselfish, non-partisan
thoughts and acts of able men everywhere are now required for
our very survival.

AFTER Harvard, I chose medicine as a career and have been en-
grossed in it ever since. There is something about the practice
of medicine that changes one’s viewpoint about many things.
Life becomes less competitive, more enjoyable, rich with satis-
factions and a feeling of usefulness. It makes one more philo-
sophical, wiser, more tolerant. The appreciation of nature in its
various aspects seems to grow in one, and the desire to learn and
explore other fields of knowledge increases with time. After
medical school, hospital service and a rejection by the Army in
1942, I entered the practice of internal medicine in Boston. I
taught at Tufts and Harvard Medical Schools during the war, and
also served as part-time physician to the Harvard Hygiene De-
partment, finally leaving in 1956. Thus my ties with Harvard
have been close. My specialty is internal medicine, practised in
and around Boston, and provides me with a full and busy day.
My interest is primarily in diseases of the heart and lungs. |
usually work on some clinical or basic research problem on my
own, which has led to a few minor contributions to the literature.

As for family, there is nothing to report for I am still un-
married, a status which I disapprove of and must remedy. I have
a niece who has just entered Radcliffe but I guess that doesn’t
count,

I have no hobby but many interests, including sailing, piano,
photography, travel and the collection of objects of art, the latter
being very limited as my tastes run beyond the pocket. Golf,
skiing and various other sports I still dabble in but with only a
shallow endeavor. Clubs and organizations are chiefly medical in
nature, which also must be corrected. In closing, I hope the next

twenty-five years pass more slowly but continue as enjoyable as
the twenty-five that have vanished.

learned the secret of maintaining threadbare respectability.

In 1939 received a life-saving medal from the Massachusetts
Humane Society for pulling a girl and her dog from the frozen
Charles River.

The desperate financial struggle was interrupted by ....
military service: enlisted as private, 26th Infantry Division, July,
1940. Inducted into active, federal service, January, 1941. Com-
missioned in May, 1942, and assigned to London, England. There,
I was on the original staff of Allied Force Headquarters being
formed by General Eisenhower to mount the North African in-
vasion. In Algiers from November, 1942, until July, 1944, when
we moved to Italy. After V-E Day, became an inspector general
examining troops for redeployment to the Pacific. This gave me
an opportunity to see Northern Italy and the lake region. Re-
turned to the States in October, 1945, and was discharged in
February, 1946. Awarded Commendation of North African

Theatre of Operations, Legion of Merit Medal, various campaign
ribbons and stars. :

Immediately after my return to civilian life, I opened my own
law office. Before it was warmed up, I went to Washington,
1).C., as special counsel to the War Assets Administrator. There
I almost learned to disdain the dollar. For example, I handled the
sale of the Inch pipelines for $145,000,000.00. Remained with the
government for seven months and returned to the realities of
private practice in March, 1947.

My practice has been general with the emphasis on trial work.
I belong to the minority of the bar who believe that the only
real practice of law is in the pit. Trials take a heavy physical toll
and they are not financially advantageous, but office work is really
the scrivening part of my profession. The predilection for combat
has led me into representing some alleged Communists before a
Senate committee. Later, 1 was on the fringe of the McCarthy-
Army hearings for one hectic week. My latest unusual case in-
volved helping to obtain a pardon for a young, psychotic mur-
derer of a baby sitter and her ward. This last case led me to pro-
pose legislation dealing with mentally ill criminals.

My wife, a graduate of the University of San Marcos, Lima,
Peru, received an M.P.H. degree in 1945 and an M.D. degree in
1949 at Harvard University. Being married to a working doctor
compounds the normal confusion of family life. The first two
years were relatively quict while Raquel completed medical
school. However, these days, between 6:45 and 8:15 A.M., our
family takes on all the excitement of a TV situation comedy.
When we finally deposit the kids at school, and my wife drops
me at the train on her way to the hospital, I marvel at what man
hath wrought.

I guess we’re both too involved for formal hobbies. The law 1s
a scamilcss web and a jealous mistress. Medicine is equally demand-
ing. We listen to a lot of music and read constantly both in and
out of our respective professions. This leads, inevitably, to books

(American history, the Civil War, famous trials, law and medi-
cinc) and records.

People remain my favorite diversion. I have made a conscious
effort to remain in contact with many of our classmates, We

SEPTEMBER, 1933, I descend rapidly from the supercilious
status of Harvard senior to the insignificant one of freshman at
Boston University School of Medicine. A few memories which
still linger — dashing up late to the door of the anatomy class,
there stopping short with butterflies in my stomach. Next march-
ing proudly — white coat with stethoscope prominently dis-
played. June, 1937, head crammed with book learning, receiving
the M.D. degree, and sailing for England, land of my birth, on the
Normandie. Shipmates, Marlene Dietrich and Jack Benny!

Three months ample time to renew old ties — Harvard’s broad
A fits in well. On return start internship at the Boston City
Hospital, marveling at the body’ S recuperative powers, humble in
the presence of death.

October 22, 1939, married in Brookline, Massachusetts, to
Miriam Berger, Radcliffe ’33. We honeymooned at Montreal,
Quebec, and Niagara Falls! Courtship gifts were purchased at
cost of blood transfusions, usual source of an intern’s pocket
money.

Interlude at the Boston T.B. Sanatorium as assistant resident,
first cash I'd seen in years. Cash? In these days the remuneration
was more in the nature of petty cash.

1940 — general practice, night calls and bells.

1942 — Elliot, first of three sons, a tiny bundle of four and a
half pounds, born at the Collamore Memorial, during a blackout.

1944 — guest of Uncle Sam for thirty-three months. Fortunate
to be able to alleviate in some small way the tragedy of war.

Back to Boston for the birth of Mark in 1948. Then a bit of
desultory practice before returning to Tennessee again for Uncle
Sam, this time with the Veterans Administration.

Number three son, Harvey, born in Memphis, December, 1949,
a little rebel, 1950 —certified in internal medicine. 1951 — hejira
by car to the West Coast with the entire family. Route: New
Orleans and the Latin Quarter; San Antonio and the Alamo; El
Paso, Texas and Juarez, Mexico; Carlsbad Caverns and the flight
of the bats; Los Angeles, Olivera Street, Beverly Hills, and Culver
City, on to San Francisco and Chinatown; across the Sierras with
its 3,000-year-old Sequoias, Grand Canyon, the Painted Desert and
back home via Oklahoma. |

Decided we had been expatriates long enough and wangled a
transfer to New Hampshire in 1952. Once more snowy winters
and summers fishing for bass and pickerel. Next sizeable trip
this past summer, Memphis revisited, tour of Florida all the way
down the west coast, across the Tamiami Trail, and up the East
Coast, Daytona Beach, St. Augustine, etc. The boys especially
thrilled with Williamsburg and the Jamestown Festival. Our next
objective — Yellowstone!

As the time for college approaches for Elliot our hopes center

on Cambridge. Thus we hope to complete the circle, Cambridge
to Cambridge.

visiting physician, Beth Israel Hospital, since 1954.
MEMBER OF: Massachusetts Medical Society; Society of American Bacteriolo-

PUBLICATIONS! Scientific papers in medical and bacteriological journals.

IN 1933 I crossed the river to spend four years at Harvard Medi-
cal School. Hospital work and some bacteriologic research took
care of the next five years. After military service in Europe with
an Evacuation Hospital assigned to the First and Third Armies, I
returned to Boston, took a brief fling at the private practice of
medicine and then turned to full time work in hospital and aca-
demic medicine, which has occupied me right up to now. I super-
vise a group of laboratories at the Beth Israel Hospital, conduct
ward rounds with interns, teach Harvard medical students and
carry on research on problems relating to bacteriology and infec-
tious diseases. The intellectual satisfactions of this type of work
are great and compensate for the limited leisure time and re-
stricted returns that go with it.

After the war I was stationed for a short while in the Bavarian
Alps and discovered to my own surprise that I had a latent interest
in mountain climbing. This led to some scrambling around in
the American and Canadian Rockies and eventually in 1954 to a
trip to Switzerland. The weather was poor for climbing but all
was not lost for I met the lady who shortly thereafter became my
wife. So, about a generation behind most of my classmates, we
have started a family. We have a two-year-old daughter, and
with good luck we may yet have the class baby, due next January.
But my mountain climbing days appear to have come to a quick
end.

NOW you've really done it! You've broken my delightfully
reminiscent mood by mailing an ingenious, demanding card to
my wife. I’m forced to abandon my reflective, retrospective pen-
cil chewing and get down to writing this thing. Truly the “re-
membrances of things past” have been wonderful pleasures, but
poor autobiography. I’ve dwelt upon my accomplishments, the
worthwhile, of course, and in sifting over the residuum have
found the only real satisfaction is my “begatting.” I’ve begat
George, Jr., aged eighteen, a wizard at electronics which I thor-
oughly misunderstand. I’ve begat Kathy, aged eleven, a fine
little artist. P've begat Pam, aged seven, who loves the wild,
woolly, horsey West. These three “begats” are my soul’s delight
and I try desperately to see life through their enthusiastic orbs.

Vocationally, I manage eight furniture stores owned by my
family. Real estate ventures on the side have also occupied part
of my spare time. I’ve sold a great deal of furniture in the Jast
score of years— some decorative, some abominable. However,
I’ve never gotten around to buying that red convertible I always
wanted —a family sedan seems more practical.

Physically, I’m in good health. My hair has a slight silver
tinge in places, a slight slightness in other places. I can’t sleep late
any more. I have to get up early, for no reason. I take exercises
—the one with the books piled on the abdomen really works
best. |

Defensively, I managed to pass the physicals for a commission
in the Navy. I spent three years during World War II serving
as a ship’s service officer. Our Kathy claims the Naval Hospital
at Yorktown, Virginia, as her birthplace due to this interim.

Recreationally, my golf games are fewer and my score is
“morer.” I tried to water ski last summer —and did. The first

[ 206 }

time put me to bed for a week. I couldn’t straighten up. I try
to ride horseback once a week with my young “Annie Oakley.”
I can’t find any bridge partners so I’ve been active in the Little
Theatre. My first play panicked me when I discovered the in-
roads time had gorged in my ability to memorize — the prompter
had a good workout.

Domestically, I’m married (see paragraph number one). My
wife isn’t so blonde any more, nor so svelte. She was an excellent
cook until she discovered she couldn’t wear a sheath. Now she
boils eggs by the dozen. We had a wonderful honeymoon in
Europe in 1937 — the Coronation included. Since that time we
have been firmly anchored in Oklahoma with brief vacations in
California.

Senator Joseph R. McCarthy or on topics related to the issues he raised.
Even the New York Times published one of such letters although they

must have winced in doing so.

THE early spring of 1931, when I left Harvard, was very cold
but not entirely due to the weather. It was certainly no time to
be selling apples down in Wall Street. Stamping my feet to keep
warm I kept thinking how nice and cozy it must be back in
Westmorley Court (Adams House) even though one must study
a little to stay in college. However, being a Harvard man, I was
not too despondent. I knew there must be other occupations
more rewarding and dignified.

It was not long before the old New York Title & Mortgage
Company convinced itself that I was worth fifteen dollars per
week. Now I was in the real estate business — but not for long.
In 1933, Shortly after my salary had been boosted to eighteen
dollars, the company went into bankruptcy. However, having
demonstrated an ability to earn so much money, I soon ac-
cumulated additional real estate experience with other firms that

somehow managed to stay in business. In 1936, I established my
present connection and the association has survived up to date.

I am now vice-president and head of the Investment Real Estate
Division which specializes in the sale, leasing and financing of
nvestment properties throughout the United States.

Despite my C in Naval Science & Tactics, the Navy was not
ufficiently impressed to grant me a commission after Pearl
darbor and thus it was that, in November, 1942, the Western
“ask Force landings at Casablanca included one Private Coogan.
Jowever, in May, 1943, at Bizerte, | somehow managed to obtain
field commission as second lieutenant, A.U.S. Then on to Italy
or two years during most of which period I served as U.S. port
aison officer in British-operated ports along the Adriatic.

It was in Italy where I met Marisa. Her father was an American
tiquarian and Marisa, who was born in Rome, had lived most of
r life in Italy and France. She had served with the American
sd Cross in North Africa and Sicily but, shortly after her
‘ival in Naples in 1943, was assigned by the Red Cross to the
lied Military Government staff because of her language fluency
1 knowledge of Italy, Rome in particular, This took her
‘ough the Anzio Campaign and, after the breakout, she went

[ 209 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

on to Rome with the occupying forces. We met in Bari, on the
Adriatic, in December of 1944 and it was love at first sight. We
were married in the Bari Cathedral following the close of the
Italian Campaign and returned to New York at the end of 1945.
Shortly after the arrival of our first daughter, Nina, in 1946, we
decided that New York City was no place for us to live and so we
purchased our home in Ridgefield, Connecticut, where Mimi was
born in 1947 and where we hope our third child will be born in
June, 1958.

Living in the country and commuting to work leave little
time for activities outside the home and family, even if one cared
to look elsewhere. There is always something to do, be it garden-
ing or normal maintenance and so I have my hobbies always close
at hand and do enjoy them, My sporting life is confined by desire
to the pace of two growing children but even so includes lots of
swimming, especially salt-water, skating and, for the girls only,
riding at which they are very good. We take many trips about
the country as both girls are very good travelers. But whatever
we do, we enjoy doing together and we always have a lot of fun.
This year we shall take up skiing, Pop where he left off in 1941,
and Mother and daughters for the first time. It will probably be
back to old Franconia once again.

While I have managed to participate to some extent in local
civic and political activities, my only other outside interest has
been the Reserve Program. I am a major in the active U.S.A.R.,
with mobilization assignment to the Brooklyn Army Terminal
which duty takes up one or two nights per week. Politically, I am
a Republican — right wing or conservative type one might call
it. I do not subscribe whatsoever to the philosophy of this so-
called “Modern Republicanism” which, to my way of thinking,
is just camouflaged Socialism with the first goal the welfare state.
When I was chairman of our local Citizens for Eisenhower in
1952, I never dreamed that things would turn out the way they
have. Now that “our” Supreme Court, led by Eisenhower ap-
pointees, seems to lean over backwards in protecting the Com-
munist apparatus rather than the real interests of this country, the
next step will probably be a movement, led no doubt by the
“Modern Republicans,” to surrender some more of our sovereignty

rights in exchange for a more active membership and participation

[ 210 ]

in a “Free World Federation.” I feel that a realignment of our
moral and political thinking, with courageous and conservative
Democrats and Republicans standing together, is our only hope of
preserving this Republic.

EVER since I left Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences
in June, 1936, I have been engaged in the profession of teaching.
The choice of this calling was not a haphazard or coincidental
affair, but rather was the result of a decision made in my senior
year at high school. It was then that I decided definitely, after
- sufficient exposure to the physics and chemistry laboratories, that
engineering was not for me. Throughout my college years, there
was little question but that I wanted to teach and teach specifically
the languages and literatures of France and Germany.

I have been at Northeastern University continuously since
1938, except for a two-year period (1944-45) when I served
Overseas with the Office of War Information in the field of psy-
chological warfare and propaganda. In my twentieth report, I
wrote that “teaching has been a stimulating, challenging, richly
rewarding experience and I am more than ever grateful for having

[ 213 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

chosen this profession,” Now, five years later, I should like again
to re-echo this statement.

It isa uniquely satisfy i ing, even rejuvenating experience to meet
anew group of eager, restful college freshmen each year; to have,
perhaps, some considerable i impact and influence upon the life and
thought of a few, and to follow the careers of this young genera-
tion as it takes its place of responsibility in the larger world out-
side. Insofar as it is possible, I have tried to know my students as
distinct individuals, to learn something about their career plans
and aspirations. Whenever I meet former students — and this
happens frequently and in most interesting and unexpected places
— 1 feel that I have an unusual opportunity to follow and check
on their earlier objectives and ideals. The twists, turns, and un-
foreseen developments in the lives of these students never cease to
amaze me. In talking and reminiscing with them I realize more
vividly than ever the challenge and significance of their college
experience and the part played in it by the instructor. Indeed, I
heartily concur with Bliss Perry “And Gladly Teach.”

My family consists of one wife and one daughter. I am out-
numbered, and I have to wage a constant struggle against suc-
cumbing to superior feminine fire power. My wife was a former
teacher in a similar field, English and Latin, and our tastes and
interests in music, art and literature run closely parallel. My
daughter, born in 1943, is an only child and a “teenager” with all
the problems and provocations that result from this double
jeopardy. She attends a fairly progressive junior high school in
Newton, and although I grudgingly concede some of the benefits
of this newer type of education, I am convinced, or at least trying
hard to convince myself, that many of the older tried and tested
disciplines are sorely lacking in the school curricula of today.

Fach summer, after teaching one summer session, I am left
with a period of seven wecks’ vacation, This vacation is spent in
traveling about the country with my family. Our vacation travels
do not follow a minutely prepared itincrary, and we seem, there-
fore, to derive greater pleasure and satisfaction from the freedom
we allow ourselves.

My hobbies are the same ones mentioned in the previous re-

port — track, handball and, on the less strenuous side, gardening.

[214]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

I call these hobbies, but actually this is a camouflage which I have
found effective in fighting the “battle of the bulge.”

As I sat down to write this report covering a period of twenty-
five years, it seemed difficult to know where and how to start.
After reading what I have written thus far I am sure of just one

thing — it’s time to stop!

'O refrain from inflicting any homegrown philosophy on a
apless reader, I determined that this would be a factual, chron-
Jogical history. And so you will find it.

When I left Cambridge on June 4, 1933, it was with the ex-
=ctation of returning some eight days later for the Commence-
ent ceremonies. I also anticipated entering the Law School in
:ptember for a three-year additional hitch in Cambridge.
either of these intentions was realized. Herewith is why.

On June 8 I landed a job as a Wall Street runner at $15 for
forty-five hour week. I worked all summer at this elevating
rsuit until opportunity knocked loudly with an invitation
m the mailing department of the brokerage firm. My new
ary was $17 with substantial overtime. By the time it was

[215 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

necessary for the autumnal return to Cambridge I was earnin
over $30— a sum not reached by any attorney friend who had
not been in practice for at least three years. So no LL.B. graced
my name and Wall Street dust continued to soil my shoes.

Wall Street boomed for another month or two. By February,

1934, the wind had died and I tied up as advertising manager
and greeter with an importer and jobber of wines and liquors.
The primary qualification for the job was a working knowledge
of basic English —an ability shared by almost none of the other
fifty or sixty members of the firm. For three years I lived a most
happy time. It climaxed in a wild eight-day sail to Havana and
back. Among the stores aboard were six hundred free cases of
liquor for the six hundred passengers. As assistant cruise direc-
tor, one of my duties was the doling out of all this free stuff.
After this promotional “liquor dealers’ convention,” the firm
had nothing that it could look forward to and expired that
very year.

Then came a two-year period of job alternating with heel
cooling. In 1938, in company with a member of Yale, ’33, I set
up an elementary plastics plant. It wasn’t until 1940 when our
raw materials became extinct (being of Norwegian origin), that
we desisted from business, Then I joined my present firm a few
months after my marriage. The fact that my father-in-law owns
it was of some significance in my initial association.

During the war my two sons were born. This, added to the
nature of my business, put me in a permanent 3A classification.
Three trips to 70 Pine Street (Naval Officer. Recruiting) did
nothing to change my status. So for three years I was an air
raid warden. |

After nine years of office-type work, I bestirred myself in
1949 and began to call on paper mills, pigment manufacturers
and ink plants. I had always had the idea that salesmen were
some kind of low humanity not proper for decent people to talk
to. Within two years I found myself, for the first time, really
loving every minute of my working time. Peddling was vibrant,
challenging and replete with greater real and intangible satis-

factions than anything I had ever done. I still do the selling for
this firm and find it increasingly stimulating. We sell technical

[ 216 ]

material and therefore most of my people are chemists or en-
gineers. A very pleasant group of men to be with.

My sixteen-year-old has oriented his school work directly for
Harvard. He hopes to be in the class of °63. I think he'll make
it too. If he does I expect much better scholastic results than from
his father. My thirteen-year-old wants to play ball — it does not
much matter what kind so long as it is round or oblong. Maybe
he, too, will go to Harvard. I certainly hope so, but I don’t press
either of them. From our lovely little two-year-old daughter
comes our great delight. She is a gay ball of fluff, a sparkling
comet, a roistering snowflake, a happy bird beaming smiles and
joy on all the household. The eagerly welcomed and unexpected
child of my old age, I don’t care if she never goes to college.

Gladys is a dynamo. We were married during her unfinished
junior year at Pembroke. So she went back to college and earned
her B.A. at Adelphi in 1952. She is charitable with everything —
even me. She can do anything (except put the cap back on the
toothpaste), stay up innumerable hours and is a genius at pro-
crastinating about anything she does not want to do. Our most
recent intriguing venture was the purchase of our big, fifty-year-
old stone house in 1954. We spent an entire year rebuilding it and
lived in the tiny garage apartment while doing it. It was real fun
and we take considerable pleasure in our finished handiwork.

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

WHEN I graduated from college I was identified as OCC — out
of course — having started with the Class of 1932, but finished
in 1933 so that I found it difficult to know which class I really
belonged to. But in retrospect it may have been a good break
since I now know many from both classes. ‘The past twenty-five
years have been active and happy for me though they make dull
reading. I went to work in my present office in the fall of 1933,
became a partner in 1937 and except for the war years have been
there ever since.

I joined the Navy in April, 1942, and after forty-two months
of sea duty on destroyer-type vessels, was separated officially in
January, 1946. I gained lots of experience and travel, but it was
an awfully long four years!

At the advanced age of thirty-six I finally got married and we
were rewarded with four boys in consecutive years which has
kept us busy. .

From 1933 until a few years ago I majored, athletically speak-
ing, in squash racquets, the only sport I was ever any good at and
participated with moderate success in every tournament, national
or otherwise, that was available. Unfortunately, age has taken
its toll so I have had to give it up and now dabble at tennis and

olf.
e Although I have the normal interests in politics, religion and
social problems I am no crusader and find my time taken up com-
pletely in business and a very happy family life.

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

I'VE noticed something about progressive Class Reunions. They
awaken in you a surprising feeling about your classmates. It’s
rather a nebulous thing, and you are amazed that such an in-
tangible should be so strong, especially since it is not a part of
everyday life. I guess it took about fifteen years for me to recog-
nize the pull of school and class “spirit.” Perhaps members of
classes which are not depression-spawned are more quickly aware
of this spirit. I know that many of our 1933 fellows were just too
busy planting their roots and financially unable to pour much
feeling into the earlicr reunions.

Sitting on the good side of a depression and a world war may
have made the difference. Add to this the ingredients of normal
nostalgia, a growing healthy family, a greater financial maturity
and advancing age, and I was then ready to make the effort.
And, of course, there was a healthy curiosity involved; who was
round, who was firm; who was fully-packed? Which of the
guys was bushy, balding or bare? You know, it didn’t take long
for me to learn that I was making no “effort.” [really liked meet-
ing up with classmates. I found myself looking fondly at fellows
I hadn’ t even known during the school years, For some reason,
barriers disappear when classmates reunite and a powerful bond
is there. Consequently, I needed no prodding to join the available
workers who will strive to make the Twenty-fifth Reunion of
the Class of 1933 an outstanding success.

It’s so much easier to think about now than then. However, we
are asked to say something about our post-1933 lives. I remember
that I did what a great number of our classmates had to do when
it became evident that the year 1933 had a rude way of dissipating
dreams and illusions: I got myself a job that I disliked heartily —
in retailing. Not that I was bad at it, mind you; for in five years
I became a buyer for a chain of ladies specialty stores in New
England. Substantial progress in business and increasing domestic
responsibilities pulled the net tight and it wasn’t until 1946 that
I found just what I wanted in a profession I love: sales, in the
broadcasting field.

The play went, as they say in baseball, from three to six to
three — from radio to television and back to radio. And while
this was going on, I learned that the professional salesman today
no longer bears the stigma of the “high-pressure” character of

[219 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

yesterday. Career selling is based on solid sound Principles
flavored with bitter experience. Good “selling” then becomes a
way of life, a philosophy and a hell of a lot of fun. In more
recent years, during training sessions, I trust I have been able to
impart this thinking to many younger salesmen. There is certainly
no greater satisfaction to a sales manager than to have a trainee
report, “Chief, I’ve been putting those theories into practice and
] have a signature on the line that is dotted.”

I’m happy now to be associated with Boston’s “good music”
stations, WCRB AM and FM. It came as a great personal surprise
that such a lowbrow as myself has grown to like all of the things
that attachment to the fine music format infers. Nevertheless,
I'm sure my sweet wife and nice kids still think of me as a low-
brow. |

I wonder why I have become more interested in spectator
sports. Each time I have a physical check-up, and I have one
quite regularly, I ask my doctor if I may continue to play squash
and tennis. He always tells me to keep at it so long as I stay with
it. The only item that bothers me is that the showers afterward
are now becoming the best part of the whole deal.

Twenty-fifth Reunion! Wonderful, ain’t it?

INASMUCH as I transferred to Harvard after two years at the
University of Michigan, my status with the Class was of a tempo-

[ 220 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

rary nature. There may be some who may remember me and the
pleasant (and convivial) times we had in Persis Smith A-23 during
Freshman year. It was there that I demonstrated a certain talent
at a project that made the meetings held in these quarters of a
memorable nature, After transferring back to Michigan in Febru-
ary of 1931, I completed my premedical work there and graduated
that August.

For the next three years I struggled with the Depression and
Maryland Medical School. 1 really should say that the school
struggled with me, but in any event the Depression won. I then
attempted the solution of a problem peculiar to this period —
how to find a job with no experience and no useful knowledge.
The big break came when I became a real estate salesman and
then resident manager of a real estate development in Baltimore.
The title was splendid, the future glorious, the work — handyman.
My wife and I gave rapid-change home improvement demon-
strations and were paid the munificent salary of twelve dollars a
week, in rubber checks.

With amazing perspicacity I came to the decision that there
might be other fields to conquer, and I became a worker and job
analyst (W.P.A.). This was followed by a brilliant three months’
career as a junior interviewer in the U.S. Employment Service.

About this time I became aware of a slight gap in my knowledge
of industry. Time study seemed to be the key that would un-
lock this treasure-house for me, so I looked for this kind of a job
and found one with Industrial-Brownhoist Corporation in Bay
City, Michigan. Four years of this and I was shifted into the
Engineering Department as an expert on shop practice. I learned
to clean up old tracings beautifully; in fact, I even learned how to
draw. During this period of three years I also acted as plant
photographer, chased down shop complaints, made difficult photo-
Stats, and developed the art of goofing-off to a fine degree. My
children have always wondered how I could detect their deviations
with such precision.

Dow Chemical and a few bucks more a month next called me
(1943) and I spent my time in plant engineering with the Mag-
nesium Division. I left Dow along with several thousand others
in 1947 and spent the balance of the year trying to make a suc-
cess of the styrofoam Christmas tree ornament business. There

[ 221 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

was some dithculry in convincing the lads in the manufacturing
firm that was making the ornaments that certain economies of
material were necessary, and the end result was that the finished

roducts brought almost exactly the price of the raw material.

For the next two and a half years I was with Kuhlman Electric
Company as a designer. A forty percent layoff here sent me
scurrying back to Dow, and I have been with them ever since,
first in gencral machine design, particularly of saran film ma-
chinery, and then back to the Magnesium Division, first on loan,
and then in 1955 transferred to the Madison Division.

My principal hobby is portrait sculpture, which I do profes-
sionally if spasmodically. My wife enjoys painting, and we both
take part in Little Theatre work, duplicate bridge, swimming and
trying to get our son to cut the grass. I hope to get my “Light-
ning” fixed up so that we can get back to sailing next summer.

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

in surgery at Boston City Hospital. During this time I had the
honor of serving under Dr. Irving J. Walker, professor of surgery
at Harvard, and Dr. Charles C. Lund, now president of the Massa-
chusetts Medical Society. My associates included several men
now fajnous in their respective fields —Dwight Harken, heart
surgeon, Joe Pratt, now chief of gynecology at Mayo Clinic,
Arnold Meikeljohn and Albert Coons, to mention a few. In
1939 I joined the Naval Reserve and shortly after finishing my
residency in surgery was called to active duty. As in many other
instances, my own was another example of assignment to fill exist-
ing gaps regardless of training. My first duty was examining en-
listees in the basement of City Hall, Augusta, Maine. Subsequent
assignments included two years of passing pills and giving inocu-
lations to Supply Corps student officers at the Harvard Business
School, and two years at a base hospital in the South Pacific, 2000
miles away from the fighting, where the best use they could find
for me was to run the officers’ club and guard the liquor. I was
discharged from the Navy with the rank of full commander and
a rustiness of surgical technique which has required some ten
years to overcome. In other respects, I have been more fortunate.
When Harvard withdrew its surgical department from Boston
City Hospital I was invited to join the faculty at Tufts, where my
associations and opportunities have been both enjoyable and profit-
able to me. I have attempted to carry on part-time research in
Vitamin C and part-time teaching along with an active private
practice in surgery. This is a very time-consuming proposition,
yet, I believe, an ideal arrangement. I am constantly learning from
my students and hope to continue to do so until the end. Anyone
who thinks research is easy has never tried it.

My chief good fortune has been a happy marriage to the former
Dorothy Tebbe, University of California Medical School, 1936,
who for a while served as a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital and
later as anesthetist at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge. In
1950 she gave up all thought of further career, much to the relief
of the rest of our family, and became a full-time housewife. Last
year we invested in a forty-foot sloop, and with our two kids
cruised to Edgartown and Boothbay Harbor. We hope to ex-
tend our cruises during subsequent summers, God willing, and
highly recommend this as a form of gentle recreation.

IN 1947, fourteen years after graduation, I finally had to do it. I
hung out my shingle and went to work. Meanwhile, I put in a
very pleasant four years at the College of Physicians and Surgeons
of Columbia University in the City of New York. The happiest
two years of my life were then spent as a surgical intern at St.
Vincent’s Hospital in New York City. Then came super grad-
uate training at the New York Postgraduate Hospital. This was
soon interrupted by the call to arms of World War Il. One of
my first assignments was as chief of surgery for the Newfound-
land Base Command at St. Johns. Also served on an International

Reassigned after promotion to lieutenant colonel as Chief of
Surgery in the 78th Station Hospital and moved to North Africa,
Italy and France. Upon release from Uncle Sam at the end of
World War II, I married in November, 1945, and returned to the
New York Postgraduate Hospital for a refresher course in civilian
surgery. My world travels over, I returned to Cambridge in 1947,
and began the private practice of surgery. For five years, I
assisted in taking care of injuries at the Dillon Field House on
Soldiers Field. I saw better football when I was in College.
My family — five— are postwar, so what time I have free is
spent with them. They are growing quickly and my hair is falling
out.

changes in job opportunities, First insurance, then publishin

and finally real estate. All in the selling end. Fact is, I wouldn't
want any other kind of work, even though looking back I might
have charted a little different course.

The depression — remember 1933 and the scarcity of jobs —
found me in Baltimore, a cub salesman for the Liberty Mutual
Insurance Company. The war years were spent in Boston as New
Frgland representative for Prentice-Hall. Somehow, I never
did quite get drafted into the Armed Forces. Promotion brought
me to the home office and New York. Then a more responsible
position with another publisher and moving the family once again,
this time to Chicago. Two years was enough of that. Chicago,
you can have it, with all its dirt, graft and corruption, particu-
larly Cook County, where we lived. So back to Baltimore, where
we have many friends, this time to stay, we hope.

Hobbies — sports, travel, music. Proudest possessions — pa-
tient, understanding wife and four healthy active boys. Only
regrets — not enough time to enjoy enough of any of the above.

ALTHOUGH my life had destined me in a strange way to an
interest in the subtleties of human nature, I was unaware at the
time of graduation that it would become my life work. After
tasting the variety of experiences that the leisurely years of col-
lege made possible, life became more earnest. It became clear
to me in the Harvard Business School that I had considerably more
interest in the secrets of nature, related to medicine, than am-
bitions which my family had had for me. My education in the
humanities had left me poorly prepared technically, and I mas-
tered the premedical requirements with difficulty in one year,
soon finding myself absorbed in the opportunities for medical
study and experience at Yale. I enjoyed an intimacy there with
my teachers and classmates that left me with the feeling that
I had found a rich vein to explore for a lifetime. Although “For
God, for Country, and for Yale” left me slightly confused and
bewildered, the university gave me a broader base for enjoyment
than medical school, and my social and cultural interests have
continued to be heavily non-medical throughout life. New Haven
provided me with a wife, whose father was an English professor,
but she has not been bound by the confines of the university or
her home town, We found a new life in Cleveland, and in that
friendly hick town found the greatest stimulation and oppor-
tunity of our lives.

World War II interrupted and enriched my medical training
with a three-year hitch overseas in the South Pacific (New Zea-
land and Saipan) with the 39th General Hospital. On the day
I reported for duty at Camp Edwards in July, 1942, a zealous
personnel officer asked me what I had trained for medically,
and the information that I had studied to specialize in internal
medicine landed me temporarily in charge of the psychiatric
wards at the local station hospital. Although anxious, I was
fascinated too, but was tagged from that moment. After a_

[ 227 ]

couple of years of this and the repeated suggestion of a senior
area consultant that I go in with the early waves of the Okinawa
or Iwo Jima invasions to observe incipient neurotic reactions,
I developed an idée fixe that 1 was really interested in derma-
tology and infectious diseases. However, my impression of the
psychological impact of the war in the Pacific remained the most
vivid of those years, and soon after I returned to this country
in the fall of 1945 I determined to continue my education in
psychiatry in a new and dynamic department of psychiatry at
Western Reserve University. There, I was fortunate to gain a
thorough training in the field of psychoanalysis which is now
my main interest. My professional life is devoted to a heavy
schedule of therapeutic treatment, to selected research problems,
to consulting work in schools, social agencies, hospital and a chil-
dren’s residential treatment center, and to both medical educa-
tion and postgraduate psychoanalytic training. The day’s work
and night’s study leave deplorably little time for social life and
family, but at least we are expanding our vacations every year.

My wife, Bliss (Vassar ’35), besides her busy hours of being
available for our three children, has completed her A.M. require-
ments in the field of education and has made a niche for her-
self teaching children in the polio division of our city hospital.

Our elder girl, Sheila, is now sixteen, learning to drive, is go-
ing steady and is preparing for college in another two years at
Hathaway-Brown School here. Having fun socially and edit-
ing the school paper take precedence over a compulsion to get
all A’s, and so far adolescence hasn’t been as tough on Bliss and
me as we thought it would be. Ben is no athlete, like his Dad,
enjoyed camp life in Maine last summer, has a lot of inner re-
sources, and can beat his old man regularly at chess. Our fa-
vorite reading has been Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn and The Year-
ling. Our youngest, Daphne, has given us all an example of spirit
and courage since her birth injury that has particularly endeared
her to us and many others. After years of struggle she has the
most lovable and out-going personality of all our children, now.

enjoys creative dancing, piano lessons and third grade at Hatha-
way-Brown School.

Bliss and I enjoy traveling and long vacations, and we visited
Austria together in the summer of 1956. We are devoted to the

[ 228]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

coastal and Katahdin regions of Maine in the summer, and skiing
near my sister’s home in Stowe, Vermont, in the winter. Bliss
hooks rugs, plays and enjoys music, and I paint in oils for my
own enjoyment, am learning to sail my own boat and know the
ways and moods of the sea. As always, I am ceaselessly reading
and a collector of books, Irish, American, English and profes-
sionally on the history of science. My present interest is Tom
Jefferson, and close friends know that I have a weakness, like
him, for something I can’t afford— beautiful roomy houses.
Bliss is more modern and practical, and we compromised for
comfort and the leisure to enjoy more what we do have. We
long to live in a place where the recreational facilities are richer
than those in Cleveland, but the professional opportunities are
second to none here.

Phantasies for the future include a trip around the world, and
slowing down in New England near the fountain of all knowledge.

AFTER staying at Harvard for one full year and being promoted

went to Northeastern University and studied law and received
an LL.B. However, I failed to pass the bar examination. Finally
I wound up with a position with the Massachusetts Audubon
Society, as their field agent. This was a full time job and I sub-
mitted records to them and they put what they wanted of them

in their magazine, Records of New England Birds. They discon-
tinucd the magazine and my position on January 1, 1957.

It was natural for me to have this kind of job because I had been
following birds since I was fourteen. While I had this job, I
took many trips, most of them in my vacations but some as part
of my job, and while on the job I passed through virtually every
township in Massachusetts. I went to Nova Scotia, New Bruns-
wick, Quebec, Ontario, Bahamas, Cuba, Florida, Louisiana, Arkan-
sas, Texas and California, some of these places several times, al-
wavs looking for various birds, Two memorable trips were to
Cuba where my friend, John Dennis, and I saw, and he photo-
graphed, Cuban ivory-billed woodpeckers and my trip to the
southern Bahamas where I saw a big flock of flamingoes; but
my most memorable trip was in the fall of 1956, when my wife,

AT graduation | had no idea what I really wanted to do. One
semester at the Medical School convinced me that it was not to be

a doctor, for which my parents had hoped. Two years and an
M.B.A. from the Business School did not completely sell me on a

[ 230]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

business career either, but jobs by that time were easy to get, not
so easy to be satisfied with. (English A never did convince me
that a preposition is a bad word to end a sentence with.) I
worked until 1939 in the finance and real estate fields in Hartford
and back in Cambridge. By then I had a wife, and we were the
typical proud parents of a daughter. It was our decision — never
since regretted — that the country is a better place for children,
so I took advantage of an opportunity to take over a merchan-
dising business in New Hampshire.

Having been commissioned in ROTC at Harvard, I didn’t rate
the usual “greetings.” The letter merely said report in ten days.
That was in the summer of 1941. The Navy was very busy in the
North Atlantic then, and that is where I spent the next year and
a half. After some more time in Chelsea Naval Hospital, the
doctors decreed a medical discharge, a decision I resented, but one
doesn’t argue with survey boards — successfully, at least. Mean-
while, my wife had been carrying on the business, but wartime
shortages made it a losing battle, and I finished out the war in a
civilian capacity in work important to the Portsmouth Navy Yard.
Also of importance in this period, our son was born in 1944.

A second never-regretted decision was to enter the field of
education. My reaction to the war and political developments of
the Roosevelt era convinced me that our young people needed an
understanding of American traditions and ideals to ward off the
drift toward Statism; too many teachers in high places had been
bitten by the bug and were in turn infecting new teachers. Taking
advantage of the G.L. bill, I acquired considerable knowledge of
history (my field at Harvard had been bio-chem) and the re-
quired credits in education at the University of New Hampshire —
which, incidentally, is a very much under-rated institution,

Since 1949 I have been teaching U.S. history at Franklin, New
Hampshire, High School. It is a rewarding life in satisfactions if
not in money. For us, the community is just about the right size.
We have moved into a brick house dating back to 1785 set on
some ninety acres, located on Route 3-A north of Franklin, and
surrounded by the finest collection of native and imported ever-
greens I have ever seen. Summers we spend at our cottage on Pine
River Pond in North Wakefield, over near the Maine line. Our
principal project now is the building of a new summer place on

[231]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

a point of land across the lake from our present site. Our inten-
tion is to do most of the building ourselves. So far we have put
in the foundation which has survived two winters without crack-
ing or heaving. The foundation is as far as we have got. Plans
were to finish it next summer, but now daughter Sandy, who will
finish training at Massachusetts General Hospital next year, has
decided to get married in July — which will probably use up both
the time and money needed for the building. It doesn’t reall

matter. One of the compensations of a teacher’s life is that there
will be another summer vacation the next year. Besides, if we get
to the Reunion in June, seeing how all my classmates have aged in

twenty-five years will probably make me feel too old to tackle
such a job — right away, at least. |

I have moved the Conestoga Pottery Company from Wayne,

BEING in a traditionally cautious and orderly profession, I will
try not to approach this report in the same way. But avill start
with the job, since it’s of some importance to review how one
manages to keep on eating. Have been with the same law firm
steadily since getting out of Law School, except for the years with
Uncle Sam described below. There were twelve lawyers when |
started and we are now approximately fifty. The growth not due
to me — it’s taken all the hard work I can do to stay even. In-
cidentally, a big difference in New York City legal practice be-
fore and after World War II is in the matter of night work.
Before the war a lawyer, particularly a young one just starting out
with a firm, would work three or four nights a week as a matter
of course. Now that’s ended, just as working on Saturdays has
ended. The credit for ending the excessive night work goes to
the veterans who graduated from the law schools from 1947 and
1948 on. They were four or five years older than earlier gradu-
ates, because of the war, and many or most had wives and small
children. So they just firmly went home at nights, refusing to

perpetuate the old foolishness and we earlier lawyers are now the
beneficiaries of that needed reform.

[ 234]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

Was four years in the Army, the first two and a quarter years
as an enlisted man. As a G.I. in the Air Corps I taught celestial
navigation to navigators of B-24 bombers in Tucson, Arizona, and
then learned Italian at the University of California in the ill-fated
Army Specialized Training Program and later acted as interpreter
and drill-master with Italian prisoners-of-war at Ogden, Utah.
In 1944 I was transferred to Washington, D.C., into Military In-
telligence (MIS-Special Branch) and was thereafter commissioned
a second lieutenant after a ninety-day O.CS. that had no obstacle
course in it. Was then sent to Guam, working with the B-29s
and watching them (from the ground) bring about the final
capitulation of the Japanese. After V-J day I left the hot and
sunny Marianas for Japan and spent a cold and uncomfortable
fall and early winter with the occupation forces in Tokyo. The

Japs had taken all the radiators out of the Tokyo hotels, planning
to melt them down into bullets, so we slept in sleeping bags on the
cold floors (at least the company grade officers did — perhaps the
field grade officers made out better at the Imperial Hotel). Then
went over to China and spent four months in Chungking and two
in Nanking as a member of General Marshall’s staff on his mission
to end the war between the Nationalists and the Communists. An
exciting but discouraging job. Returned to this country and was
discharged from the Army in October, 1946; at that late date I
felt very much the last man out. | |

Met my wife during the- above-described four-year vacation
from the law. She was in the Red Cross and beat me overseas and
occasionally reminds me of that. In India, during time off from
her Red Cross duties in the Assam Valley, she shot a tiger. Perhaps
inspired by that, around the house now she’s still trying to tame
me — and has probably succeeded.

I voted for Eisenhower the first time round, but for Stevenson
the second; have been equally inconsistent in most other things
as well. The principal hobbies are (a) playing tennis doubles
(am too old for singles) and (b) trying to get the three children
interested in sports and outdoor life — hard to do in New York
City. |

A chief interest apart from the law work is helping to put out,
each year, a book which collects all the memoranda issued in
support of or explaining bills enacted by the New York Legisla-

[ 235 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

ture. Five or ten years later, when you want to know why the
heck a certain statute was enacted and who was behind it and what
the statute was really intended to do, the New York State Legisla-
tive Annual can be most useful. I also work for, and occasionally
write papers or give speeches on, the matter of improving legisla-
tive procedures — The New York Times erroneously said recently
that I was an expert in that field.

P.S. The Japanese never did get those radiators melted into
bullets. Right after the occupation began all the radiators were
found, neatly piled in rows in a warehouse in the outskirts of
Tokyo and ready for melting. This is the sort of (limited)
efficiency which probably helped the Japs to lose the war.

AS a person who swore he would never leave New York (let
alone the East), and as a person who detests hot weather, I find
myself five weeks transplanted to Miami. I am in this situation
thanks to an extremely exciting job offer, the corporate will, and
advice from Bill Schroeder. Bill loves hot weather.
Most of my fun and satisfaction in business has come about
through working with, and perhaps helping to develop, people
younger than myself (which these days means everybody). This

[ 236]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

was certainly true in my twenty years of association with Abra-
ham & Straus in Brooklyn. In February, 1956, I became a vice-
president of Federated Department Stores, the parent company.
In that job, essentially I was working with the brass, and it wasn’t
too much fun. As president of Burdine’s, I should have plenty
of opportunities along the right lines — if the mermaids let me
alone.

I find I have had a great many interests, some of which I even
pursue: tennis, roaring around New York (particularly walking
over the Brooklyn Bridge), following current events, profes-
sional football, reading of all kinds, contemporary art, boating,
TV, movies, looking at the water any place, traveling when on
vacation, most spectator sports, good or unusual restaurants,
ditto bars, theatre, crossword puzzles, financial dope, small talk
with intimates.

I dislike meetings, staying up late, most parties, public speak-
ing, small talk with persons I don’t know, traveling when working
— and a million other things I spend most of my time doing.

I have kept very close to the Business School since graduation;
not so the College. As a matter of fact, only a few years back
I almost resigned from “A and S” to become a professor in mar-
keting at the “B. School.” I did not because I couldn’t afford it.

I’ve had a good home life, at least to the day my son became
a teenager — and I found myself less worthy a father than my con-
temporaries (of all of whom I had been contemptuous). My daugh-
ter Molly, aged ten, is a dream; so was Jimmy atten. My wife has
become a real pro (i.e. an amateur pro) in the broad field of so-
cial work, but particularly working with groups of children, ages
four and five, and with their parents and teachers. She loves it.

Our family has thoroughly enjoyed living in a section of New
York few people know about — Brooklyn Heights. It’s a stone’s
throw from Manhattan, with a view of the breathtaking Lower
New York skyline. For years, I was able to walk to and from
work. Our house, built in 1806, is spacious and extremely attrac-
tive. It will kill me when I have to sell it! So, too, we have had
_ pleasure living in Westport, Connecticut, for some fifteen sum-
mers, With tennis and water and plenty of kids, it couldn’t miss.

My major disappointments over the years have had to do with
expecting too much from people, mainly myself,

I AM particularly appreciative of your invitation to include my
narrative, since 1 deserted Harvard and the East Coast in 193!
and can count on my thumbs the number of times that I have
since visited Cambridge. ,
I completed my college work at the University of Washington
at Seattle, and worked for some food processing companies in
Seattle, before I joined the Navy as an aviation cadet. It was
during my years of flying with the Navy that I consciously en-
joyed a course I took at Harvard. That course was one in geolo-
gy. Long flights that might otherwise degenerate into a monotony
of keeping tabs on fuel gages and listening to radio signals be-
came opportunities to observe first hand the meandering streams
of Florida, the volcanic peaks of the Alcutians and the atolls of
the Pacific. From flying with the Navy, I drifted back to en-

[ 238]

gineering and went to work with the Army, Corps of Engineers,
on the development of airborne construction equipment. One
of my developments, an airborne crane-shovel, was found by an
Intelligence researcher, written up in a Czech magazine, It was
the same little crane, but it took on an exotic look with all those
strange words surrounding it. To complete my round of the
services, I went to work with the Air Force where I work on
airfield requirements such as runway lengths and clearance space
to get aircraft in and out of a field.

In my wanderings I met my wife in Norfolk, Virginia. She
is a true rebel. Her grandparents were in the path of Sherman’s
March to the Sea. In spite of my being from Massachusetts we
were finally married in a little Episcopal church in San Diego,
by the chaplain of my ship, the U.S.S. Enterprise. We have lived
in all corners of the country, but feel rooted now with nine
years in one spot. We indulge in our favorite hobby of beach-
combing with an annual trip to the ocean, generally to Bethany
Beach, Delaware. We now have four handsome sons and one
beautiful daughter. I wish I could send you their picture in-
stead of mine because they, you may be sure, are my life and my
fortune.

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

WHAT a wonderful twenty-five years! Sitting here at the type-
writer with a glorious California moon chased by Sputnik over-
head, my mind reflects on the great transitions witnessed by
man during the past quarter century. My trail in 1933 turned
westbound from the Harvard Yard and led to Santa Fe, New
Mexico, for my first career post with the Boy Scouts of America.
Serving two-thirds of the State from there as apprentice field exec-
utive, I found time to win and wed the loveliest wife ever to go
down the scouting trail through life. The Scout career flourished,
with the family living in twelve houses, in fourteen towns and
cities, in twenty years while I held professional Boy Scout po-
sitions in San Diego, San Mateo, California, Great Falls, Montana,
Pomona, California, and thence to Petaluma, California. Oh,
yes, tried teaching school one year along the way, and then went
right back into professional Scouting.

In 1953, traveling about serving other folks’ children in Packs
and Scout Troops had become such a burden on the family, that
I entered the insurance business with the related opportunity of
being “home nights” to help Martha with our four swell kids.
They somehow recovered from the shock of seeing “that man”
around the house regularly, and let me continue Boy Scout work
as a hobby. This is most readily accomplished by saying “yes”
when the local executive asks you to head the Merit Badge
Counselor Committee for Petaluma, and when the president of
the Lions Club wants you to serve as committee chairman for the
Explorer Post sponsored by the club, 1 was asked, and I did,
and so it goes on— “once a Scout, always a Scout.”

What’s it like to have your own Cub Scout Den around home
continually? Wery wonderful indeed. Oldest, “Bud” Datson,
came through all the way to Eagle Scout with flying colors and
enjoyed the National Jamboree at Newport Beach with fellow
Explorers from our local Council. Laura Beth made a fine Camp-
fire Girl, and kept mom and dad humping during her years of
expericnce with her own horse. My, those cold mornings getting
over to the stable for feeding before high school started! Johnny

keeps all our radios and TV sets in good repair, having parlayed
his home hobby inro an after Junior High School job in a local
TV store, He is working toward his Eagle Badge, also. Sidney
Marie, “and she is a lady,” earns honors galore in Campfire Girls,

and does very well as a household helper to mother, sixth grade
variety.

Our vacations together usually have been of the camping type,
featuring such locales as Lake Tahoe, Trinity Alps, High Sierra
spots, and some choice national parks including Glacier and
Yosemite. The Boy Scout jobs kept me humping, but when the
family did play, we really had fun. Will not soon forget one of
our family trips north to Canada, visiting the Waterton Lakes
International Peace Park.

Fishing is the hobby. Out here we do it with outboards on
small boats on branches of “Frisco” Bay, or lure the wily steel-
head in the coastal rivers at spawning time.

Our latchstring is always out, and we'll gladly show you some
mighty fine redwoods. We follow the Harvard eleven in our
Sunday edition of the New York Times, and the airlines make
the distance back to the Yard seem not too great. Yes, it’s been
a great twenty-five years, Here’s to the next!

THIS is a tougher assignment than writing a scientific paper! I
guess at the very outset it should be admitted that I’ve been
extraordinarily fortunate since graduation. Though I have been
interested in natural history since about five years old, I sort of
drifted into it professionally. Certainly I “concentrated” in biol-
ogy, but didn’t have the sense to know that I really wanted to
stay with it until I’d spent a summer in the high country of Colo-
rado after graduation. That did it, I cancelled my admission to
the Business School and stayed at Colorado College to get an
A.M., in the hope of persuading the Graduate School of Arts
and Sciences that I might be good enough to get the doctorate.
Pretty tough job, in view of a regular good-time Charlie under-
graduate four years (with only one A and that in Fine Arts!).
But there’s no doubt about it, the decision was the right one.

The year after the PH.D.— and the three years in Cambridge
again were wonderful — saw me join the staff of Reed College in
Portland, where I served my apprenticeship as a professional
academician in biology, met the niece of the Dean of Women
and married her (the niece, not the Dean) and started a family.
Some may perhaps think that I married the niece because the
Dean — who is now Aunt Maida— owns a ranch on one of the
finest trout rivers in Oregon. I have been known to undertake
all sorts of nefarious machinations to get the rights to good trout
fishing, but I haven’t gone that far yet... . Anyhow, we'd
been married a bit over a year and had Mary when bango.. .
December 7th, 1941. Second class in Aviation Physiology (high
altitude effects, etc.) at Randolph Ficld and then for four years
Various stations in the training commands. When it was all over
I joined the staff of the newest campus of the University of Cali-
fornia here in Santa Barbara and it looks as though I'll probably
stay here as long as I am effective.

The Santa Barbara move was, of course, a great break. It

[ 242 ]

came my way because Alfred Redfield, who has always been sort
of a “father-confessor,” heard of an opening here. Better, my
interest on the Coast had turned to marine biology, in part be-
cause of a summer at Woods Hole. The end result is that I have
“my own” marine laboratory, small indeed, but the only one on
the West Coast which is directly on a regular-session under-
graduate campus. The new college has a magnificent site, with
some two miles of ocean frontage, Like everything else academic
in this crazy state, the college is in the process of far too rapid
expansion. We have 2600 students and are known as a “small
college”! No one knows what the future will bring and how
we can maintain some standards in the face of such numbers
as it will be necessary for us to train. But that is another story.

Most of my time has been spent in trying to become a better
biologist. I think, in a small way, I have managed to cut myself
a place as an authority on a particular biological phenomenon,
that of symbiosis. ve been interested in trying to identify the
physical and chemical factors that bind animal partners together
(parasite to host, etc.). In general, many parasites “recognize”
specific substances emanating from their hosts and are “bound
to them” by a strong positive response to this substance,

My interest has resulted in a Guggenheim Fellowship for work
in England in 1952. We had a magnificent year in the West
Country and developed a passionate love of Devon and (you
guessed it) its trout rivers. Made many good contacts, of course,
and have lasting friendships there. This in turn led to an interest
on the part of the Office of Naval Research in my work. The
O.N.R. is interested in communication of any sort between
animals in the sea and has supported my research in the past three
years to the extent of about $25,000.00 in grants. The grant
money has for the most part gone into salaries for persons to
work under my direction, but having funds available for travel,
etc., has made the research more productive and life more in-
teresting.

Of recent years I have become very much interested in animal
behaviour in general, in part under the drive of the advances made
by the European group who call themselves ethologists, Kon-
rad Lorenz of Munich is the elder statesman of the group; I
strongly recommend to all his wonderful popular work, King

[ 243 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

Solomon's Ring, which explains far better than any professional
papers exactly what ethologists do. Konrad is a man with the
same “reverence for life” that Albert Schweitzer has. I mention
this only because it gives some indication of the evolution of my
own interest, from classification of animals in my beginning years,
through some physiological interests during the forties, to interest
in the whole animal and, indeed, a far greater interest than pre-
viously in the philosophy of biology, the evolution of behaviour
and of ethics.

Religion and politics? Dangerous subjects! Re the former,
I have perhaps taken a greater part in the church than one might
once have suspected I would. Probably the result of becoming
increasingly aware of the uncertainties of this life, but also proba-
bly resulting from an increase in interest in the evolution of
ethics. You can therefore find me at last on some Sundays going
around and around with the adult Sunday School class in Monte-
cito. Politics? An “out,” an “egg-head,” a three-time Roosevelt
winner and two-time Stevenson loser. Fed to the teeth at this
moment with “government by inaction,” the administrative give-
away of tideland oil, and much of the public domain of the na-
tional forests, etc. But also with the intransigent right wing of
my own party in the South. If this doesn’t sound like the poli-
tics of a “button-down collar” academician, what does?

I shall conclude by saying that I see extraordinarily little of
my classmates, who are mainly conspicuous by their absence in
this part of the country. Perhaps I should have mentioned that
many summers see us in the Pacific Northwest, where the family
have a place on Orcas Island not far from the marine laboratory
of the University of Washington at Friday Harbor. Again a
frequent chance to mix pleasure and business. I mention this
only in the hope that if any classmates find themselves on that
beautiful island in the summer they'll give me a call.

We wish that we could come east more often... but now with
the polar route open, way stops for me seem even less likely.
Perhaps part of a sabbatical in Cambridge is in order!

IN retrospect, I consider the last twenty-five years of my life as
a period of growth by trial and error. Harvard offered a great
many opportunities which I failed to grasp; in 1933, I emerged
both semi-educated and immature, Ten years of financial prob-
lems and hard work after graduation had some beneficial effects,
my greatest teacher, however, was life on a dirt farm during the
war years. At forty I had some common sense and some measure
of success in the business world, and now, at forty-seven, I believe
I have a deeper understanding of life and an appreciation of how
little I really knew heretofore.

Hard work and slightly defined purpose, although sincere, are
not the recipe for success. I have tried many things: after a short
stay in medical school, I received paying jobs as teacher and
athletic instructor in boys’ private schools (having worked during
college as a camp counselor and athletic instructor), and for a
little while seemed to be riding the gravy train during those sad
years of depression. At twenty-eight, I became an assistant head-
master, but alas, the routine got me down. So in 1941 I borrowed
some money, took out three mortgages and purchased an operat-
ing dairy farm and really went to work. Yes, actually I began my
day at 4:15 A.M. for five years during the war. At the same time
I had a second job as expeditor in a defense factory and a third
job as high school athletic director, which kept the sheriff from

[ 245 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

our stable door. Later I managed a chain of large dairy farms
here in Connecticut, but that’s another long story.

This led to the restoration and sale of early American houses,
farms and estates — namely real estate. At last I could see where
‘ [ was going. That’s what I’ve been doing since 1947, when I
became associated with this fine old conservative firm. Let me
say that only the attractive and very understanding gal I married
ever would have put up with me during the first few years of this
racket when we restored several revolutionary period homes for
ourselves and our customers; that can be fun — particularly if the
client is paying the bills, Eventually I considered myself an expert
on suburban and country properties here in northern Connecticut
(but it took a long time for the firm to agree with me, as is the
custom with most fine old conservative firms).

While inducing friends and clients to leave the confines of Hart-
ford and other nearby cities, I took an interest in the zoning and
school problems of my quaint town of Harwinton and of others
located in the hills west of Hartford; I served several terms as
chairman of several different boards. I also started the first Cub
Scout program, the first day camp and the first tennis club in our
area, |

I hope the next few years will bring as many benefits and gains
as the last few. My growing-up process since college appears to
have been more gradual than is common, but thanks to many
changes in Harvard itself and to a more serious attitude on the
part of the students, I feel that most present-day undergraduates
and young graduates will get on their feet sooner in life than I or
many of my contemporaries. They seem aware of the need for
acceleration and for better concentration of effort in this atomic
age,

I do have a lot for which to be thankful — the same good wife

I started with; three normal, interesting children now in college
or boarding school; and a healthy life in the suburbs and country-
side of Connecticut. And I am thankful for the Harvard in-
fluence or Harvard background that provided me with an open
mind and a change of pace.

A VOLUME, instead of the present vignette, would be required
to report adequately on my life and times because my personality
is too complex to lend itself easily to brief recital. Moreover, the
impact of the world on me and of me upon the world has been
too great. What follows, therefore, must be regarded more as a
caricature than as a biography.

Like Gaul, it may be said that my life divides itself naturally
into three parts, with additional parts — it is devoutly hoped —
to follow in due course. The first of these — lasting largely
through my law school servitude — was chiefly notable, in retro-
spect, because I had enormous capacity for wonder at the pure
excitement which an unknown world held. Every book — and
I read a lot in those days — opened up enormous vistas of fascina-
tion; every girl—and I knew a number —held a mysterious

[ 247 ]

mines. These will be vitally needed building blocks for a world
whose known resources are inadequate to maintain our standard
of living another twenty-five years, much less improve it. And
the break-through of other countries of the world into a standard
of life approaching our own will require new resources in un-
dreamed-of amounts to make possible the thrilling episodes of
history to come. Only science fiction thinking begins to make
sense. Imagine a world of 600,000,000 in China or 400,000,000
in India with a car, a helicopter, or a spaceship in every garage.
Or a world where the threat of atomic war is foolish history.
It’s got to come or there will not be even two little Indians.

In any event, here I am today on lower Broadway, older, cer-
tainly — wiser, uncertainly, but basically the same chap who
when asked at graduation in 1933, “Where are you going?” said,
“Out.” It will be for others to say, in response to the question,
“What are you doing?” “Nothing.” Me, I think I have been busy.

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

FATE has been kind to me during the past quarter-century. My
usual response to the question, “I Tow is the world treating you?”
is “\fuch better than I deserve.” I believe myself to be a happily
discontented man. The discontent, I hope, testifies to continuing
growth toward greater self-realization. The happiness, I know,
stems from niches difficult to estimate.

First, Winifred, our two girls and I call ourselves a happy
family. Our illnesses have been few. We have sense enough to
enjoy each moment to the full and to anticipate the future with
optimism. Second, I envy no man his job. I consider teaching
one of the greater of callings, and within Teachers College the
only limitations I feel are those imposed by my energy reserves
and by the extent of my imagination.

How much credit is due those four Cambridge years for the
fortunate state of our affairs? Who can tell? One thing is certain:
The endless hours in Mallinckrodt laboratory had little direct
carry-over value. My strongest conviction after ’33 was that I
didn’t want to be a chemist. Mfemories of Harvard are for mea
montage of strange new visions, impressions, feelings. The magic
of an evening in the court of Fogg Art Museum bewitched by the
Stradivarius ‘Quartet. Discovery from standing room only 3 in the
topmost balcony of the glory of Wagner, Verdi, Bizet. Quiet
evenings in Dunster House library, living, more than vicariously,
through a Sturm und Drang siege with Goethe. Learning with the
patient help of willing classmates to savor Boston from chapel
service in the Yard to the Old Howard, from tea in Belmont to
speakeasy beer in Joe’s (?) second floor, walk-up, rear. The brew
was potent. Kent and Nictzsche got mixed up with Schiller and
Lord Byron. Bach and Bacchanalia beat an obligato to thermo-
dynamics and atoms. By the time commencement rolled around
in June of ’33, I was ready for no more than that.

During the summer and early fall of that year I half-heartedly
tried to find work, even without pay, as a chemist. I found noth-
ing. It was here that the turning point in my life came. My
mother suggested that I register for substirute teaching in our local
high school, This was a new idea — and I didn’t think much of it.
However, when she pointed out that the job paid five bucks a
day, saw the logic of her position. The first time I was called in

to substitute in ninth grade algebra and in tenth grade biology, I

[ 252]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

had an experience much like Paul’s on the Damascus Road. This
was what I could throw myself into with enthusiasm! Why
hadn’t someone told me of teaching before? Since that time my
life has been singlemindedly devoted to education, teaching and
administering in grade school, high school and university. The
task suits me so completely that I have never seriously considered
anything else.

Perhaps just to demonstrate consistency in my enthusiasm, I
married a school teacher (Winifred L. Evans, Skidmore ’38).
Now I find that our two girls, Cathie and Wendy, both want to be
teachers. The years ahead look inviting and exciting. How could
they be otherwise when my days are spent helping pioneers of
the mind? Helping those who look to the past and the present
only because they are eager to help solve the problems of the
future? Working only with those who are not fading but grow-

ing?

“It is typical of the last twenty-three years that Fred doesn’t see

how he can find time to write ‘his life’ and so I am doing it for
him.

“T used to think, when we first married, during his second year
at Law School, that he was terribly busy and worked such long
hours. Live and learn! His early years as a lawyer included
working Saturdays and a great many evenings. When he did
come home to Wenham, he was often out again pursuing in one
way or another, his one real ‘hobby’ — politics. Pursuing this
hobby, he took leave from the law in 1940 to help run the Will-
kie campaign in Massachusetts.

“In 1941 we went to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, with our two young
sons, ages two and three, and a half-grown, clumsy Newfound-
land pup. As a second lieutenant he didn’t rate quarters, so we
lived in Lawton. Whenever he reached the top of the quarters
list, he got promoted and down we’d go to the bottom of the
next list. As the rising hour for horse-drawn artillery of the
school troops was 4:30 A.M., and supper eight or later, I won-
dered why I used to think he worked hard at home.

“After two years in Oklahoma, we were at Camp Gordon,
Georgia, until Fred went overseas, as a major in the 18th Field
Artillery Battalion, in February, 1944, just before our third son,
Philip, was born. We won the pool for guessing the date of
D-Day, his birthday, and shortly after, his battalion joined the
First Army in Europe.

“He returned in 1946 to resume law practice and became a
partner in his firm. He was called to Washington just before
Christmas in 1947. It was to be a three months’ job working for
Forrestal, though he was still a staunch Republican. Nine months
later he was back in Boston and Wenham, where he became
the Town of Wenham’s Moderator, one of his favorite jobs, he
always maintained.

“Since the war he has also been on a good many other civic,
political and charitable boards and committees. He gave a great
deal of time to C. A. Herter’s campaigns for Governor and was
closely associated with him during that time, serving as his coun-
sel from October, 1955, to January, 1957.

“Despite the pursuit of his ‘hobby,’ he managed to take his
family, same wife and children, different dogs, on annual vaca-
tions to the Adirondacks for fishing, a dude ranch in Wyoming

and trips to Bermuda and Florida. Ee is still an ardent Harvard
football and hockey fan. Bridge is our chief enjoyment and we
never turn down a dance. He excels at both pastimes,

“[ can't give a true picture of Fred without mentioning that
perhaps his favorite sport of all is staying home with a good book. |

“At this writing we are settled in Washington, D.C., where
Fred is Special Assistant to the President, leaving in Massachu-
setts our oldest son, David, a junior at Harvard, and Alex and
Philip at Brooks School.

“The President told Fred, when he was sworn in, that he'd
never work harder in his life. It’s one of the truest things he
ever said. Oh, for those leisurely days at the Law School, where
weekends were your own, with a little light studying, and vaca-
tions were frequent and never cancelled!

“It would also be typical of Fred if he edited this to such an
extent that he might as well have written it in the first place!

Polly Dearborn.”
Epitor’s Note. Because I hope to survive my Twenty-Fifth Wed-
ding Anniversary as well as my Twenty-Fifth Reunion, I would
not dream of touching the author’s manuscript. Besides, it is in-
finitely better than I could have done, even with two Harvard
degrees. However, in all honesty I must point out the moral
of this story — namely,

Barnum and I can fool some of the people all of the time. I
am one of the world’s laziest characters.

Secretary's Note. Fred’s death came as this book was being
paged by the printer, and there was no opportunity to prepare an
obituary in place of the above report which Polly Dearborn wrote
for Fred and to which he attached that little “Editor’s Note.” The
Secretary would like to add that all of us who knew him were
deeply hurt by his sudden death. Truly he died for his country
which he had served so faithfully in war and peace, in Washington
and on the battleficlds of Europe. He was giving everything he
had, aiding President Eisenhower in the cold war, when he was
struck down.

Elis classmates should be told how devoted he was to Harvard
and all it represents, and to this Class of 1933. Ele had taken on
the job of 25th Reunion chairman until he had to resign for a

[ 256]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

higher duty. And yet he was still willing to take on the work for
Hank Bourneuf of Chief Usher at our forthcoming June me-
morial services for deceased classmates. .

Irad Hardy, our Class Committee Chairman and Chief Marshal
of the Alumni in June, spoke well when he said at the time of
Fred’s death that the news “will be sorrowfully received by all
Harvard men” and that the Class “will remember him with pride.”

His car, which I think he would have managed to get to the
reunion, bore the Massachusetts number plates “H-1933”. We will
remember him.

PUBLICATIONS: Numerous papers on fossil vertebrates, especially fishes, pub-

LONG before I entered Harvard, I had hoped for a career in
natural history, yet it was a matter of chance that directed my
interests to paleontology. Like many youngsters I wanted to go
on an expedition, and through the kind offices of Tom Barbour,
then director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, I was able
to do so as an undergraduate. We were to hunt for fossils in
Wyoming and Montana, and in spite of the fact that we spent

[257]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

half of the summer looking for a dinosaur, and the other half
digging one out with hammer and chisel, I was committed from
then on to paleontology. For graduate work I went to Columbia,
since at that time Harvard had no vertebrate paleontologist on
the faculty. On emerging from that institution fully educated, I
had some difficulty in finding a position that offered suitable
scope for my budding talents. I ended up at Dartmouth where I
was assistant curator in their small museum. In Hanover, I spent
ten years among congenial surroundings, acquired a wife and two
sons, enjoyed the skiing, fishing and other outdoor sports, and
taught meteorology and mathematics to the Navy during the
war. After the war, I devoted a year to collecting fossils in Africa
for the University of California, then moved to Chicago, where
I have been occupied since in collecting, studying and caring for
the fossil fishes in the Natural History Museum. Though I am not
getting rich, this has proved to be a most satisfactory position
since it offers the opportunity to do research in the field of my
own choice.

As a country lover, I feel that it is a misfortune to have to live
in Chicago, yet there has been the compensation of collecting
trips that have taken me to various parts of North America, as
well as a year’s study in Europe on a Guggenheim fellowship. I
keep occupied in my spare time with hand crafts such as lapidary
work, jewelry making, metal spinning and wood turning and still
do a bit of fishing when the weather encourages it.

IN the spring of 1951, we moved to Garrison for the full year and
rented the house in New York to my cousin, Fair Dana, ’33. Both
my wife's family and mine have lived in this community for
several generations, so that we felt quite at home right off. Tom
graduated from Oakwood School, a Friends’ school in Pough-
keepsie, last spring; Pierre still has three more years there, and
Emily is in the eighth grade at the Garrison School. I have
been working for R. B. O'Connor & W. H. Kilham, Jr., Archi-
tects, for the last thirteen years, and have been an associate for
ten of them.

What with my work, committees and chores around the place,
I haven’t much time left for hobbies. My brother manages to
get me out on the golf course occasionally, and I have a 1929
Bugatti roadster that I tinker with whenever I get the chance.
We usually try to get to the seashore during my vacation, al-
though this year we did not make it. My wife and I love this
part of the country, and are as content here as we could be any-
where, commuting to work notwithstanding.

alot. But, believe it or not, I can sum them up in only four words.
Very lucky, very happy.

Nineteen thirty-three was a vintage year for jobs. Remember?
No one in New York was interested in the dates of Charlemagne’s
reign; constitutional origins had absolutely no market value. So,
J demonstrated magic in Macy’s Toy Department for six months.
Not bad, if you didn’t like to eat much, but at least I could buy
stamps to keep writing to that girl in Boston. Went into the print-
ing business in July of 1934 and have been in, or near, it ever since.
June 4, 1937, stopped writing to that girl in Boston — married
her instead. Cheaper, what with stamps, railroad fare, etc.

Actually, I date all the important things in my life from June 4,
1937. That luck and happiness I mentioned started then and have
remained and increased every year since. “Two daughters and a
son have come along to broaden the area of happiness. The lucky
part of my life has been that my work has always let me have
more time with my family than, I think, most men have. The
rewards have been great. Our life has been, and is, warm and
full and rich and active.

In 1946, after twelve years of printing (and hoping for some-
thing besides F.D.R. and the New Deal) I started my own busi-
ness in visual sales aids, Kept at it until 1949, then free-lance pro-
motional work until 1953. Then the postcard business and now
(still in printing) business forms and systems. (1952, after waiting
twenty years, we got a Republican president and the best I can
say, after five years, is: “This is better?”.)

Spent some early years delving into, and teaching, the philoso-
phy of Henry George. I still believe in it but no longer empty
a drawing room in twenty seconds flat with the mystic words
“Single Tax.” Now I serve on school committees and church
boards. It still lets me talk a lot but I don’t lose so many friends
and I can see some results. A confirmed home-owner — Radburn
and Mahwah, New Jersey, and now Pearl River, New York —I
found out how much I like to work with tools. My only real
hobby is a fairly respectable workshop. In my next reincarnation
I hope I’m a cabinet maker. I also hope that in that life, I'll be
Satisfied with our government. But I doubt it. In the last ten
years church life — Presbyterian, if you like labels — has been an
increasingly important part of our life.

Twenty-five years, More than half of my life. More, actu-
arially, than I have left. Let’s not ask that silly question, “What
would vou have done differently?” There’s no answer to it, any-
way. Let’s count our blessings. I'm glad I studied mediaeval
history at Harvard. So very g lad I met that prop of my life,
Elizabeth Phillips. That my w ork has kept me, if not rich, creative
and active and inquiring. That my children are still the finest
arguments for parenthood that I’ve met. That I still get Christmas
cards from classmates I haven’t seen for years. That I have riches
enough in my life, now and in prospect, to enable me to echo my
father’s ambition to be the oldest living Harvard graduate.

AFTER leaving Harvard at the end of our sophomore year, I
transferred to M LT. where I completed my engineering work
and graduated in June, 1933, with an S.B. in aeronautical engineer-
ing. It was still close enough for me to return to Lowell House
and the Harvard campus to maintain contact during our junior
and senior years.

In September of 1933, I started to work for the Glenn L. Martin
Company in Baltimore, as a junior aeronautical engineer on the
first Martin Model 130 flying boat for Pan American Airways.
The following year, I went to China as a special representative
for Martin when PAA inaugurated transpacific service with their
new Martin boats. I traveled extensively in the interior and within
a year I was intrigued with the idea of taking up permanent resi-
dence in China.

For the succeeding five years, I was connected with the Com-
mission for Aeronautical Affairs of the Republic of China with
emphasis on establishing an aircraft manufacturing industry within

[ 262 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

the Republic. It was a fascinating experience and I was delighted
to have the opportunity to make a minor contribution in my field
during those days prior to the Sino-Japanese war.

In 1936 I met and married Eileen Constance Cheng in Hong
Kong. Our two children, Douglas and Penelope, were both born
in Hong Kong. Douglas, now nineteen, is a sophomore at Pomona
College, and Penny, now seventeen, is a senior at the Rim of the
World High School in the San Bernardino Mountains. It was
because of the children, after our movement westward to the
Burma Road as a result of hostilities, that I made the decision to
return to the United States with the Intercontinent Corporation,
a company credited with starting China National Airways Cor-
_ poration, the principal domestic air carrier of China. This com-
pany has extensive interests in the aviation field in South America
and India. One of their projects involved the design and manu-
facture of a small all-metal monoplane trainer for transition train-
ing for the then modern fighters.

Because of Intercontinent’s interest in the Harlow Aircraft
Company of Alhambra, California, I was elected as vice-president
— general manager to carry out the plan for such small trainer
production. It involved design, certification and construction of
tooling and parts for ultimate completion in India by Indian labor.
The same techniques were employed as were found successful in
our China operations.

Came Pearl Harbor, and I decided to remain in California
rather than return to the East. I stayed on at Harlow in the same
capacity and directed our war production under direct and sub-
contracts with other organizations. One of the most gratifying
experiences during this period was our association with Cali-
fornia Institute of Technology and the Office of Scientific Re-
search and Development involving early rocket developments.
At the conclusion of the war in 1945, our factory, as well as
others in the aircraft industry, was hard pressed economically
and by that time I was interested in returning to the Orient.

Early in 1946, I joined Northwest Airlines, Inc. to assist in their
bid for presidential designation as the first scheduled U.S. Flag
carrier to the Orient over the Great Circle route through Alaska
and the Aleutians. While awaiting the CAB decision, I was
assigned to aircraft procurement projects at Boeing and Martin,

[ 263 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

but in July of 1946, when the certificate was awarded to NWA,
I proceeded as the first member of the company to survey the
route and make necessary ground facilities preparations. This
gave me the opportunity I was then looking for to re-establish
mv contacts in the Fast.

Traveling 140,000 miles each year, with a growing family, made
it imperative for me to return to the United States and it was a
family decision to remain in California. Accordingly, I went into
several years of engineering consulting work, mostly connected
with airline equipment and operations. I am now employed by
the Lockheed Air Terminal, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of

Lockheed Aircraft Corp. at Burbank, Calif., as director of projects
development.

TWENTY-FIVE years already! Back in 1934— on May 8th at
10 A.M. to be exact —I started what I fondly expected to be a
meteoric career in the newspaper business, as a member of the
sports department of the Boston Traveler. Later, I shifted to the
editorial staff of the Boston Herald and have worked exclusively
for that fine paper since then in many capacities. I started in the
newspaper business right smack in the middle of the depression
and have been depressed ever since. At one time, I thought I was
going to be a big wheel in the news business. Twenty-four years
later I am somewhat of a wheel, in the sense that I keep going
round and round in a rut. Hell, though, it’s a living, not a very
expensive one but a living, nevertheless. I must like the newspaper

business, though, for have had many attractive and more profit-
alle jobs offered me in the state government and private business
and have turned them all down, dope that I am.

After working as a sports writer, copy editor, reporter, rewrite-
man, feature writer and night city editor (ten years), in 1948 |
was assigned to cover the State House. It’s a fascinating job, if
you don't mind hard work. It seems to me, though, that in all my
twenty-four years in the newspaper business I never had a soft
job. All the hard ones they give to Devin. Covering the State
Ifouse has become sort of a hobby with me. I know politicians by
the hundreds — governors, senators, representatives and ward
heclers. [ like both Democrats and Republicans. Myself, I am an
independent voter, since on my job I feel that I have to be non-
partisan, which I try to be at all times.

My only war service was defending Boston Harbor as a
member of the Coast Guard Temporary Reserve — “Hooligan’s
Navy.” We whizzed around Boston Harbor in a picket boat,
boarding all incoming and outgoing vessels. Once we were sent
outside the submarine net in our picket boat (a thirty-eight-footer)
in search of an enemy submarine, What we were supposed to do
if we ever spotted it, I'll never know.

After the hostilities, I settled down to a happy home life with
my wife and daughter. I have only one child but all the good-
ness, virtues and beauty of a hundred children are wrapped up in
her. As you can guess, I am rather wrapped up in her myself.
After she graduates from college, law school and medical school,
1 am going to lock her up in a convent. I'll probably stay with
her as Dom Devin or Brother Pierre, or something.

My wife is a darling, too, although she gets a bit stuffy when
her favorite husband reaches for a second one. We and the Boston
Five own our home in Milton, where we have a massive collection
of books, most of them purchased from Vic the Bookman who
forces newspapermen to buy his wares on the dollar-a-week plan.
You wind up with 18,789 books. Every kind of a book but a bank
book. We also have the finest fireplace in Milton, or any where
else for that matter, Glass doors, yet.

over old times. I was confined in the Quincy Hospital. Perhaps
I should have been more confined because all the nurses thought
I was a mental case. Had a lot of fun, at least as much fun as you
could squeeze out of a coronary attack, An old pal, Dr. Joe
Wassersug, ’33, was a hospital staff member and dropped in for a
cheery chat every day. Great fellow, Joe. I must have a lot of
friends, for while in the hospital I received 600 letters and tele-
grams from all over the place and there were so many flowers it
looked like a wake at Waterman’s.
I bounced right back to active duty, though, | but I have to walk
up Beacon Hill in first speed, pausing now and then in Mort
DeWolfe’s (33) bookstore on Park Street to “bwouse” about as
Julian Lowell Coolidge used to say. You remember that story, of
course. It seems a Harvard student once asked Professor Coolidge,
“What is the best way to get an education?” Coolidge thought
for a moment and then replied, “The best way to get an education
at Harvard is to wead, wewead and bwouse about.”
In all my working years, and I hope all my life, 1 have made
thousands of friends and I have no known enemies, except myself,
of course. Probably will have a large funeral. Cheers.

AFTER a brief tour of government service (1934-36, including

baby carriages. This occupation led to three delightful years in
New York City. Moved back to Massachusetts and cost account-

I built a house in Wayland i in 1947 (with a major assist from

THE joyous prospect of being part of the rollicking delegation
in next June’s Alumni Procession underlines the perspective-
lending qualities of time. There comes to mind a similar pro-
cession wending its way past University Hall to Sever Quad-
rangle a quarter-century ago. One recalls the surprising com-
ments from the watching undergraduates on the ravages and
physical inroads on the contemporary “twenty-five-year class.”
To the 1958 audience let me say:

Come cheer the balding and the portly.

And remember,

As you are now, so once were we,

As we are now, you soon must be,

Elders of a famed fraternity,

Apart from the war years when I did personnel recruitment
work for the U.S. Civil Service Commission in New England,
I have been engaged principally in the field of secondary educa-
tion. It has been most satisfying to work with young people and
to try to pass on to them the University’s ideals of truth, loyalty
and integrity. This gratification has more than offset the dis-
couraging decline in educational standards and the distorticn of
values imposed by the indifference of a materialistic-minded
society. The re-evaluation of American education ordained by
the Missile Age holds promise of salutary changes.

My wife and two boys continue to keep me active with their
Cub Scout, Boy Scout, Junior High School, P.T.A. activities,
etc., and to give wonderful meaning to life. Our lengthy summer
vacations provide abundant opportunity for puttering and “do-
it-yourself” activities around the house, reading and occasional
trips through eastern Canada and the United States. Since we are

[271]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

only about twenty minutes from the Square, we have been able
to maintain contact with Harvardiana—trips to Widener, the
various museums, lectures and an occasional extension course,

In short, life has been happy and relatively simple.

AFTER graduating from Harvard Business School, I went to
work in the investment business with Gertler & Company, and
later Salomon Brothers & Hutzler. Even though this was not a
lush period in the investment business, I gathered valuable ex-
perience calling on insurance companies and banks,

In the fall of 1937, I went into the family business — whole-
sale and retail bookselling, where I have been ever since. Be-
cause the reading of hard-bound books is getting to be a lost art,
except in the cases of students and children, our industry is not
getting its share of the consumer’s dollar. In spite of its being in-
creasingly difficult to make money, | am very happy selling
books. .

We live only a few yards from Marblehead Harbor. Accord-
ingly, it is only natural that all of our family enjoy boating of
one form or another. Jane and I race our Herreshof “124.”
Pete has been cruising around in his outboard and has worked

be on the water. The children will soon be going off to school and
college. After that I hope that Jane and I shall be able to do
some of the many things we have thus far been unable to do,
We are all looking forward to our Twenty-fifth Reunion next
June and the renewal of our friendships with our classmates

and their families.

THE year 1933 was not a propitious one to a graduate seeking a
future in the business world. A job was not to be had. After
several connections with the alphabetical agencies of the time, I
resolved to enter a career of law, and applied and was admitted to
the Law School. There I spent three grinding but enjoyable
years, capped by the receipt of an LL.B. and the passing of the
bar exams. Immediately thereafter I began my apprenticeship as
a lawyer in Boston on a “space for services” basis.

A year later it was my surprise and good fortune to be ap-
pointed an Assistant District Attorney for Middlesex County. I
immediately entered upon the trial of criminal cases with the
zeal and enthusiasm and the vigorous eloquence characteristic of
youth. The training and education received by me in the follow-
ing eight years of constant trial work was invaluable in prepara-

[ 273 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

tion for the private practice of law; it also gave me wide contact
with the lawyers and judiciary of the County. A young lawyer
can get no better legal training than in a prosecutor’s office.

After my resignation from the District Attorney’s office, I re-
turned to private practice, first in Boston, then in the small grow-
ing town of Framingham, where my practice has steadily in-
creased, especially in the fields of conveyancing and corporate
and probate law.

In 1939, after several years of impatient wooing, I married a
girl who had illusions of becoming a modern Portia even to the
extent of obtaining her law degree. However, marriage to a
budding attorney fearful of competition even at home, quickly
dispelled her ambitions and abrogated her legal career. In the
normal course of events, our first boy, David, and five years later,
our last, Stephen, was born. David, at St. Mark’s, has proved an
able competitor in football, hockey and baseball, Perhaps he will
in the near future contribute to the athletic prowess (sic) of
Harvard. Stephen, somewhat younger, attends Fay School and
shapes his activities to play rather than competitive sport.

In the field of politics I have been active as a Republican. While
in the District Attorney’s office I assisted in the direction of the
successful campaign of the then District Attorney for Lieutenant
Governor and later, for Governor. I have served as counsel for the
Town of Framingham, chairman of the School Committee and
am presently counsel for the Framingham Housing Authority.
With the passage of time, my political activities are becoming
more restricted to an interest in local affairs.

The fostering of a law practice large enough to support my two
youngsters at private school leaves little time for relaxation. My
indulgences other than liquid are an occasional game of golf and
the preparation of gourmet dishes. If not in the kitchen, I can be
found glued to the hi-fi with B.G. and Satchmo.
~ The rapid passage of time dims the realization that our age has
been increased by a quarter of a century. However, the mirrored
reflection of greying temples and bald heads brings home the
fact, and we now seek solace in being referred to as distinguished

in appearance.

Philadelphia earned the M.D., and two years at Blockley added
the internship necessary to start practice and marriage. After
securing a position in the Medical Division of the duPont Com-
pany in Wilmington, Delaware, the field of preventive medicine
and occupational medicine became absorbing enough to keep
me in the Martinsville Plant of the duPont Company from 1940

UPON graduation from the Harvard Law School in 1936, I
engaged in the practice of law in Kansas City for approximately
four years. In 1941 I decided to forsake the law for a more re-
munerative position in private business. In 1942 I was inducted
into the Army and served with the Air Force for three years, two
years of which were spent in the South Pacific theatre.

Upon my discharge from the armed forces in January, 1946, I
married a girl I had met in Sydney, Australia, but not before a
certain amount of red tape had been overcome regarding trans-
portation, immigration requirements, etc. Our marriage took place
in September, 1946, in Reno, Nevada, of all places, in order to
avoid the three-day waiting period required by California law.
On June 5, 1948, our son, Peter Mark, was born. We hope that
when the time comes he too will enter Harvard. As for the
future, I am looking forward to a new career in the practice of
law, which I plan to re-enter within a short time.

FOLLOWING a summer of travel, college was followed by four
years in medical school at Cornell. An acquaintanceship with the
things that New York City has and does so well was fun. Offi-
cially, I became a “Doc” in ’37 and then started an internship in
medicine at the Strong Memorial Hospital, Rochester, New York.
I remained for another year as an assistant resident in Medicine
and Neurology. I left Rochester in 1939, with the intent of be-
coming a neurologist starting an internship at the Neurological
Institute, New York City. Here, at Columbia Medical Center
overlooking the Hudson, I stayed on for three years being pro-
moted, as it were, to assistant resident and resident with training

in neurology, neurosurgery and psychiatry. The continuation of
academic and clinical work was interrupted by the war. I received

my commission as a lieutenant in the Naval Service in the Spring
of ’4z, — earmarked as a specialist in neurology and psychiatry.
I was originally assigned to the “Rochester Unit.” My orders,
however, were lost on some chief’s desk and I ended up “all
alone” at the Norfolk Naval Hospital. Unhappy as I was with
the turn of events, my future became assured. I was in the largest
naval hospital, practising my specialties and serving under a man
who later became chief of neurology and psychiatry for the Naval
Service. This relationship was responsible for an interesting and
lappy naval career. |
Medically, my experience in Norfolk was a satisfying one.
Association with the townspeople was perhaps best characterized
yy the photograph in Life magazine indicating that dogs and
ervicemen were to keep off the Court House grass. By then, one
nd one-half years in the Navy, five years of hospital training and
our years of medical school led me into marriage in 1948.
Shortly thereafter, my Chief of Service took me to the Bureau
f Medicine and Surgery in Washington, D.C. Here I became a
areaucrat involved in the statistics of wartime, the placement of
urologists and psychiatrists, interesting medical plans with rela-
ns to coming invasions. I became expert at writing letters,
ficult to understand but always proper, under an admiral’s name.
ashington was a delightful experience but, after one and one-

[277]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

half years, | accompanied my “Sponsor” to the West Coast where
we were involved in the staffing of a new hospital designed for
the treatment of combat weary sailors and marines. Hence, |
returned to clinical work and the pleasures of San Francisco until
the War was over and I was released to civilian life in February,
1946.

We drove back East in our war-weary car to Philadelphia. I
wanted one more year of “University life” to determine whether
a professorship or private practice was for me. That year we
lived in Chestnut Hill and I taught at the University of Penn-
sylvania in the Department of Medicine —the Donner Clinic
for Functional Disease. Life at the university and association with
Dr. Strecker was interesting. However, something over a year
of university work convinced me that the multiplicity of duties
and intrigues were more than my single-purposed disposition
desired to handle. Somewhere over the years, 1 had become
qualified as a neurologist and psychiatrist by the American Board
and I finally decided to find a spor to live and practise. My ex-
ploring trips around the country permitted me to discover Texas.
Having left a blizzard in Philadelphia, I arrived in San Antonio
with the temperature at eighty degrees, to be entertained close
to the Alamo and in the setting of palms, tropical growth and
good Bourbon. The combination made the decision for me. Since
then our desires for the East have been easily settled by a flight to
New York, Boston or the Maine Coast. They are always pleasant
to visit but we are always glad to return to San Antonio.

Since 1947, I have been in the private practice of neurology and
psychiatry in association with three other specialists, whom I had
either worked with or known intermittently prior to our arrival
in San Antonio. Private practice has been satisfying, mixed with
teaching, time spent on ranches, symphony and Little Theatre in
San Antonio, vacations in Mexico, congenial friends, many hobbies
and visits from old friends, The Southwest has been good to us.
What the future holds is difficult to say for at the time I left
Harvard I am certain I had never heard of Texas and psychiatry

was something caricatured in the New Yorker. Time, I hope, will
bring new surprises as pleasant.

Family-wise, 1 am still happily married to the first wife that I
took unto myself in 1938. I have a sixteen-year-old daughter who
has an exceptional voice which continues to astound us by its
mere existence let alone her ability to use it. Our twelve-year-
old son has the fastest draw east of Tombstone but shows a suf-
ficiently serious scientific bent and ability that will lead him
away from Harvard to M.LT.

I have a number of hobbies outside of the practice but my

THE fascination in looking back over twenty-five years is to find
what influences in the college years led you to where you are
today. My case appears particularly baffling for all things that I
intended to avoid in those immediate pre-graduate days have
come to hand. I remember promising one merry group of beer-
drinking friends shortly before final examinations that I would
never again look at a college textbook nor knowingly speak to
a college professor — nor would I work in a foreign land where

[ 284 |

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

English was not the native tongue — nor would I take a job that
required much travel away from home. Within a year I was
employed by a college textbook publisher and assigned the job
of talking to college professors throughout the United States
during all waking as well as working hours. Having carefully
avoided all science courses to the extent allowed by the curricu-
lum committee, I found that eighty percent of the books I was
selling and manuscripts I was seeking were in either science or
engineering. My respect for both the textbook and the profes-
sor increased immensely and by the time the war broke out in
"41, | would not have changed from my chosen life for anything
but the Navy.

I loved the sea and hated airplanes, so the prospect of a war
at sea held many charms as against the military aviation. I spent
four years in the Navy, but in the aviation side, and those years
were the only ones since I was ten years old that I never set foot
on a boat or ship. I was stationed first at Quonset, then Corpus
Christi, and finally Hawaii, awaiting sea duty, when the war
ended. I held numerous assignments from officer in charge of
the B.O.Q., student record officer to flag licutenant and flag
secretary to Admiral Mason.

In 1944 while stationed in Corpus Christi, 1 was married to
Barbara Brady and have been happy about it ever since.

After the war, back to McGraw-Hill for another go at text-
books and professors, It was a happy ten years during which I
held numerous jobs, including that of science editor, sales man-
ager, vice-president in charge of college texts, medical texts and
technical writing department.

In 1954, for family reasons, I resigned from publishing to take
the responsibility as executive vice-president of Gulf Sulphur
Corporation, a new company whose assets consisted of a sulphur
mine in Salinas, Mexico. I moved my family to Houston and
for the next three years, with time one-third in Mexico, one-third
in New York and one-third in airplanes, tried to get home for
weekends. In the summer of ’57 we gave up Houston in the
hope of having more time together and moved to New York.

I have proved to my satisfaction that new small corporations
are more exciting and challenging than large corporations. They
are also more time-consuming. There have been no vacations for

[ 285 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

three years, but weekends when available are used for golf, sail-
ing, tennis or any other active sport available. We have a small
house in Orient, Long Island, where we retreat when possible
and enjoy our own company. My boat, a thirty-foot sloop,
has been on the beach since my excursion into sulphur, but I
hold hopes of seeing her in the water by next summer.

And so pass twenty-five years and my viewpoint has broadened
to the point where I realize that textbooks and professors were
not as deadly as I had thought, that working in Mexico can be
much more fun than I would have believed in 1933. Further-
more, even travel is pretty good fun when kept within bounds
and I should miss it if chained to a permanent desk. Even air-
planes aren’t so bad, probably safer than destroyers.

And so, even if my earlier aspirations were not realized, I have
had a wonderful time, even though I may not have been doing
exactly what I had planned.

WE all know that the 1933 economy changed the charted course

of action of many individuals, and I was no exception. My in-

tention to teach mathematics stayed with me, however, for two
more years, spent in graduate work at the University of Vermont
and at the Graduate School of Harvard University.

By’ 1935, though, it seemed advisable to pursue a course of
action which would provide a more remunerative existence than
that provided by scholarships and outside jobs. It was then that
I became interested in actuarial work and took a position at the
home office of the Prudential Insurance Company of America in
Newark, New Jersey. There I found that both George Walker
and Bert Winter, fellow mathematicians of the Class of 1933,
had arrived at this same conclusion a year earlier,

My new course of action required that actuarial examinations
be passed in order to obtain professional standing in the national
actuarial societies. This course proceeded smoothly, except for
interim years surrounding 1938 when I married Phyllis Bickford
(Bates 38). By 1943 the actuarial examinations were behind me,
and I became eligible for various Prudential actuarial positions.
All of my experience over the next ten years was obtained in
the Group Insurance Department, where I had an opportunity
to work successively in underwriting, then in the administration

of the department and finally in group sales and service activi-
ties. This fairly definite course of group insurance training
encountered an abrupt change in 1953 as a result of Prudential’s
plan of decentralization of geographical portions of its operation.
I was assigned as second in command of the new regional home
office to be established in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

In 1954 I moved my family to the shores of Lake Minnetonka
and enjoyed some very pleasant years before Prudential’s plan to
establish a decentralized operation in Boston again changed my
course of action and brought me “back East” in time to partici-
pate locally in the Twenty-fifth Reunion activities of the Class
of 1933.

Since we have not as yet moved our home office administrative
operations to Boston, I have had little opportunity to remain in

[ 287 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

the area long enough to participate actively in community func-
tions, A typical week currently consists of three days in Newark,
one day in Boston and one day in a field office in New England
or Upstate New York. The weekend is generally spent with the
family at our latest “permanent” home in Ipswich, By the sum-
mer of 1958, however, my commutation to Newark will probably
not be as steady and I shall have an Opportunity to spend more
time in Boston and New England activities.

In all of these locations I have been interested in the work of
the Harvard Clubs. First of all in New Jersey, I felt particularly
indebted to the Harvard Club of New Jersey for the freshman
scholarship which enabled me to attend Harvard College. I was
very much interested in the work of the Schools and Admissions
Committee of the Harvard Club in New Jersey. This interest
carried over into Minnesota where I had the privilege of work-
ing with Don Peddie, ’41, who is doing such a marvelous job
in attracting young Minnesotans (and good football material,
too) to Harvard. I was president of the Harvard Club of Min-
nesota during the last year I resided there, but missed the high
point of our season’s activities for, when President Pusey was
addressing our Harvard Club in Minnesota, I was being intro-
duced in Boston as the individual in charge of the insurance
operations to be administered from the new Prudential Center
to be built in the Back Bay area over the next five years.

We have found our return to New England to be very interest-
ing, although — as in connnection with every change of home
location — all individual members of the family face the task of
making friends all over again. We did enjoy our participation
in the various community activities both in Minneapolis and
around the Lake Minnetonka area and are looking forward to
resumption of similiar activities as soon as we become reacquainted
on our own New England home grounds.

Recently we moved into our radically remodeled home. I men-
tion this principally because it is an interesting structure conceived
by my nephew, Franklin A. West, Jr., a product of the Carnegie
Institute School of Architecture and the Graduate School of City
Planning at Yale. It is not merely contemporary; it is avant garde.
We hopefully regard its chaste, precise design as something which
eventually will titillate us into esthetic responsiveness.

I am not convinced of the significance or propriety of even

[ 289 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

cursory comment on controversial subjects in a class anniversary
volume. Yet your invitation to make such comment is tempting
since it is rare that one has an opportunity to unburden himself
about matters which he considers important.

One of my cherished memories of Harvard College was its atti-
tude toward my religion which is Roman Catholic and toward
other religions as well. I have no doubt that there were atheists,
agnostics and possibly militant anti-religionists on the faculty, but
I never knew who they were. I was let alone with my religion.
Others respected it or were indifferent to it. Was this situation
at the College a fact or was I guileless, naive or merely oblivious
of the actual state of affairs? Has Harvard changed or was our
fellow-alumnus, Father Dulles, mistaken when he spoke of the
Harvard he knew as exerting a subtle (and sometimes not so
subtle) antitheistic influence of teacher over student?

Recently the headmaster of the grammar school which my chil-
dren attend and a Harvard alumnus of more recent vintage than
we, was quoted as stating that most of the Harvard graduates of
twenty-five or thirty years ago would never qualify for admission
and certainly not for graduation from the Harvard of today. This,
of course, injures my vanity, but aside from that I believe that
there is an important principle involved. There would be reason
for serious concern if Harvard were not somehow a “better”
school now than it was a generation ago; if it did not maintain
distinctly higher than average standards for admission and for
graduation; if it did not do all that it could to attract gifted young
people and to make it worth their while to have come to Harvard.
Current prosperity and the accompanying stampede for a college
education I suppose permits even greater selectivity than was
possible during our era of the depression. But has this really made
a significant difference? I rather doubt it; I believe that the “typi-
cal” Harvard student was as able twenty-five years ago as he is
today. He is probably more competent than most.

The College, of course, will continue to improve. It was re-
assuring to hear President Pusey (in his recent television inter-
view) say in effect that so far as Harvard is concerned, what this
country needs is not more education but better education, and
that Harvard’s policy would be directed toward qualitative rather
than quantitative improvement.

THE early years after graduating from Harvard Business School

were spent moving from one selling job to another, including one

year hitches with Boston Edison, Dictaphone Corporation, Em-

ployers Liability Assurance Corporation and Morse Diving Equip-

ment Company. It required the impact of a world war to provide
me with work approaching any degree of permanence. Thus
1942-46 found a field artillery officer somewhat skilled in the care
of horses and French 75’s operating a small fleet of supply boats
out of New London, Connecticut, as army transportation officer
for the Harbor Defenses of Long Island Sound. In spite of the
overpowering presence of the Atlantic Submarine Fleet, the US.
Coast Guard Academy and various underwater sound laboratories,
it was sometimes a unique experience for a second lieutenant, as
army representative, to drink an occasional olive or cherry with
eight or ten well-salted admirals at various civic functions.

All in all it was a pleasant duty and particularly memorable
because Dickie was born there in February of 1944. As a matter
of fact we were considering returning to New London, figuring
atmospheric conditions were more favorable when at last we were
blessed with another son, John Joseph, in July of this year. I have
been able to maintain my attractions for the water, although not
always glamorous, through my connections with Morse Diving
Equipment Company and McKie Lighter Company here in
Boston. For those who may not know a lighter is a floating
derrick used in waterfront construction work and for heavy lifts
beyond the capacities of ships’ booms for cargo being loaded or
discharged.

My chief hobbies now are growing grass and flowers chiefly
occasioned by a necessity to remain close to home with a growing
group of little rascals. We have our share of lighter moments,

The joys and pleasures I have had are those common to the

NOT too much of interest has occurred since my last report.
I finally became a college graduate in 1952 and marriage caught

matter of record. As a result, I remained in the Navy but intend
to retire in three years and return to insurance brokerage. In the
meantime I shall be at sea again, in the Mediterranean, and shall
try to catch up on current legislation as it will affect estate plan-
ning.

After living in New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Hawaii,
Virginia and New Jersey, we have now, I hope, settled in Con-
necticut. Three years from now will, of course, be the determin-
ing factor, but I am looking forward to that day.

As to my navy career, I have had five commands at sea, served
as executive officer on three other ships and have had four staff

jobs.

I was married at Marblehead, Massachusetts, January 4, 1934, to
Barbara Louise Hodges and we have three fine daughters.

The past twenty-five years have really flown by.

fluorescent spectrum of S;, During this period I met and married
my wife, who was a Goucher graduate, Class of ’35. We later
moved to Chicago, where I taught physical sciences at the Wilson
Junior College for about a year. We then moved to Washington
where I worked with Dr. Fred Brackett (Brackett Series) at the
U.S. Public Health Service on ultraviolet microscopy and infra-
red. When the US. entered World War II, we moved to Cam-
bridge, Massachusetts, to work in the ficld of radar. At the end
of the war, we went to Washington, D.C., where I started to work
with Dr. E. H. Krause in the Naval Research Laboratory Upper
Atmosphere Research Program where, among other things, I
participated in the work which led to the first spectrum of the sun
taken from above the earth’s atmosphere, extending our knowledge
from the atmospheric cut-off of zg00 Anstroms down to almost
z100 A. Later we participated in nuclear weapons test in Opera-
tions Sandstone & Greenhouse. I was also in charge of the design
and early construction of the NRL six-million electron-volt elec-
trostatic accelerator (van de Graaff).

In 1952 I left the Naval Research Laboratory and Dr. Krause
for two years to serve as associate director of the newly-formed
Chicago Midway Laboratories, set up by the University of Chi-
cago to carry out research and development for the Air Force.
In 1954, T left Midway to rejoin Dr. Krause in the also newly-
formed Missile Systems Division of Lockheed. At the end of 1955,
as a result of differences concerning management, Dr. Krause and
a sizeable group left Lockheed to form a small consulting firm,
Systems Research Corporation. This company later affiliated with
and became a subsidiary of the Ford Motor Company. This com-
pany, Aeronutronic Systems, Inc., was formed with the objective
of becoming a major developer and producer of weapon systems,
an objective toward which we are moving steadily. Recently, we
have announced the acquisition of a large site in Newport Beach,
California, for our permanent location, and will start construction
of the first unit of our facilities very shortly. In the short space of
fifreen months, this company has achieved wide recognition in the
military, and has been asked to compete on some of the most im-

portant military programs now getting under way. It is my re-
sponsibility to guide and direct a group working on the concep-
tion and analysis of highly-advanced weapon systems. We have

[ 298 }

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

covered a wide spectrum ranging from small antitank missiles up
to vehicles capable of placing a large payload on the surface of
the moon.

On the personal side, my wife and I have devoted our interests
mainly to the arts, both of us performing on the piano, and doing
some creative work in the graphic arts. My wife’s present chief
interest is enameling on copper, while I have entered the field of
photography somewhat seriously. Other hobbies include high
fidelity (which I entered in 1929!), woodworking and mountain
climbing. |

We have been moderately active at times in political “leg-
work,” starting with some door-bell ringing for the Independent
Voters Committee for Roosevelt and Truman, but careful ob-
servation of the national scene has converted us into frank and
outspoken democrats (also Democrats). I did not realize what a

great man I was working for in Truman; I now find my more
reactionary friends a bit shocked at my rating him second among
presidents only to Lincoln, Roosevelt and Washington (the order
I named them in was not inadvertent). Eisenhower I respected
at first, but his actions and, more often, the lack of them, have
effectively suppressed this. |
Summing it up, life has fared well for the Durands and, barring
a nuclear war, we anticipate that it will continue to do so. We
have found that there are a great many very wonderful people in
the world, and we are proud to have many as our close friends.

MY being included in this Class Report is due to the courtesy
that “Dropped Freshmen” are still considered to be Harvardmen.
After putting up with me for a couple of years, Dean Chauncey
allowed me to “withdraw” saying, “You have absorbed much of
what we try to teach here — how to think.” I’ve always hoped he
wasn’t trying to be kind.

My father, who was football manager in ’o8, had taught me to
say “Harvard” while still an infant. As I grew up, he felt that
my one-sided interest in mechanics should be offset with a liberal
arts education, but his death at the early age of forty-one did not
permit him a try at holding me on this course. As the years have
passed, however, luck and a variety of interests have led to a
reasonably rounded life in line with what he visualized.

The depression and the need to eat led to a number of jobs and
undertakings and to a more mature outlook. In 1934, I married
Sara N. (Sally) Pickett of New Haven, and the same year took
my first “real” job, with the B. F. Sturtevant Company of Boston,

starting as a trainee and progressing to sales engineer and manager
of the branch sales office in Springfield, Massachusetts.

[ 300 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

At the start of World War II, the Van Norman Machine Tool
Company of Springfield required a development engineer. This
was followed with a variety of experience there, including assign-
ments as a market analyst, district sales manager and chief en-
gineer. The company would not sign the necessary release to
permit active war duty, so there I stayed.

By now [d made up my mind to a future career of market and
new product research and development, only to unmake it when
I learned the hard way that this function is a most easily curtailed
luxury when budgets must be trimmed.

I next joined a young Springfield firm, Associated Engineers,
Inc., as their thirteenth employee, and left several years later when
it had grown over twenty fold, again having served in a variety
of supervisory and managerial capacities, Stints as an industrial
engineer and as a manufacturer's agent followed.

In 1950, the opportunity I'd been seeking for several years at
Barrington Associates, Inc., New York (management consultants)
materialized, and I’ve been there ever since. My forte has been
marketing and management, but the old mechanical bent comes in
handy now and then.

Travel and living away from home have made responsible par-
ticipation in community affairs almost impossible, and weekends
at home together are very precious. We therefore chose boating
as a family hobby. Our schooner, Dutchess, has been very satis-
fying to recondition and a happy way of life. Our son, Bill, aug-
ments the rather staid cruising boat by driving his bronco-like

outboard speedster, and by racing his “Blue Jay” class sloop. Bill
is now a junior at Berkshire School, Sheffield, Massachusetts, and
I hope, headed for Harvard with more purpose than I had.

AFTER graduation came Harvard Medical School for four years,
graduating and marrying in June of 1937. Thence to two years
of interning at Rhode Island Hospital, with the Mrs. secretarying
at Butler Hospital and supporting us in a style to which neither of
us was accustomed. From there to Woodsville, New Hampshire,
for a year’s trial of general practice in a locum tenens. ‘This we
liked, and so settled on Stoneham, Massachusetts (suburban Bos-
ton) for permanent residence and practice. -I had just gotten
started, so to speak, when along came World War II, and four
years’ service including the South Pacific, Luzon and Japan.

_ Emerging in 1946, I came to my wife and a two and one-half-
year-old daughter whom I had never seen before. General prac-
tice has absorbed most of my time since then. This may sound
dull to the forty-hour a week people, but medical practice seldom
is that. It is demanding of time, but rewarding in many ways.

I keep my hand in at golf, under eighty most of the time. We
have a summer place on Ossipee Lake, New Hampshire, and usu-
ally spend the month of July there, concentrating on sailboat,
birds and swimming. We all have been blessed with good health
and we enjoy our out-of-ordinary roles as members of a medical

family.

fortunate to become associated with the Minneapolis branch of
Thompson-Hayward Chemical Company, a general heavy
chemical distributor. My first job with them was to develop the
Agricultural Division with particular emphasis on specialties for
animal and poultry feeds. After having had the experience of six
years of general chemical sales, I was appointed manager of the
Minneapolis Branch, which position I held until December, 1945,
at which time I resigned. On January 1, 1946, S. D. Horton, a
former associate at Thompson-Hayward, and I started the Horton-

SINCE every yesterday had a tomorrow which became today’s
yesterday, it is more than difficult to review twenty-five years in
terms of a beginning, middle and an end. The best I have been

[ 304 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

able to do in retrospective review is to call up a series of memories,
which confirm to me at least that on the whole, in spite of de-
pressions, war and post-war tensions, life on this earth is well
worth living.

A little like the chiropodist who entered the Army, was sent to
Cooks and Bakers School and upon graduation was assigned to
truck driving, it comes as no surprise to me to find myself en-
gaged in the manufacture of aircraft, having prepared myself for
this career by devoting my required educational hours at Harvard
to English, history, geology and most valuable of all (as well as a
cherished memory) a course entitled the “History of the Printed
Book.”

The pathway from then to now was not a straight one. After
leaving Cambridge, I became employed by a large oil company,
not because I had a flair for inserting air in tires and gasoline in
tanks, but because it was the only payroll to which I was able to
attach myself during those depression years, Fortunately, the
filling station part did not last very long but my association with
the oil company did for quite a few years.

During undergraduate days, I was fortunate or foolhardy
enough to be active in a splendid institution called the Harvard
Flying Club. Things aeronautical continued to interest me, and
therefore when the recent unpleasantness occurred, I found my-
self instructing youngsters in the art of flying, ferrying aircraft,
and finally flying gasoline tankers for the Air Transport Com-
mand over the Hump.

Two years after peace became the order of the day, fortune
smiled on me in my marriage to my wife who today shares with
me the not entirely unmixed pleasures of bringing up our two
youngsters. We have a good life with our children, our home in
La Jolla, California, our joint interest in tennis and swimming
and all the little things that make for a happy life. May this
pleasant state of affairs continue until my next Report twenty-
five years hence.

The rest of my time has been filled with the various functions
revolving about life in a small town — raising a family — main-
taining and improving a 150-year-old house — participating in
local government and church activities — and spending some time
on professional activities. For over ten years, I have been on the
Planning Board in a rapidly growing town which, like all others,
has its unique problems of regulating development and assimilating
new growth. I also served on a high school building committee
which found itself with a half-built two-million-dollar school and
no contract. I’ve often heard people talk of retiring to a quiet
place in the country —I wonder if they shouldn’t stay in the city.

OCCUPATION: Teacher.

OFFICES HELD: Member, Secondary Education Booklist Committee; member
executive board, Private School Teachers of Philadelphia, Phi Delta
Kappa, 1938. .

I HAVE been a teacher since graduation. I am now teaching

in my sixth school and I am occasionally appalled at the length

of time I have been teaching. Summers have been devoted to
camp work for the most part. My wife and I ran an interesting
sailing camp in Maine for seven years. The children are pleasant
and moderately well-behaved. My contribution to society has
not been world-shaking, but I trust that it has been beneficial.

The twenty-five years since college have been interesting and

rewarding.

After college, a job at Belmont Day School consisted of teach-
ing shop, athletics, third and fourth grade, and being janitor.
The next year, first of married life, was spent at the Ulverston
School in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. I was dealing with the
special students and ended up as co-headmaster by the end of
the year. The school quietly folded (not because of me) and
the field of education took a step forward. Two years in DeWitt,
New York, three years at the Edgewood School in Greenwich,
Connecticut, four years at Smith College Day School (I became
one of the first male holders of graduate credits), three years in
Concord, Massachusetts, at the Fenn School were all varied and
rewarding. Since then I have been located in the Philadelphia
area as a teacher of sixth grade in Germantown Friends and am
now teaching junior high English, German and am varsity coach
of soccer and track.

My eldest son is in the Army; my daughter is doing a year
of apprentice teaching before heading for college; the two
younger boys are active in sports and love school; my wife is
a medical] secretary. The cold facts leave out the fun of doing
things like climbing Katahdin as a family, cruising the Maine
Coast, some dramatics over the years, singing, working part-time
for a plumbing contractor and the little rewarding things.

HAVING attended the Law School for three years with the idea
in mind of practising law in Boston, I became associated with a
Boston law firm on receiving my LL.B. in 1936. Obviously, how-
ever, my entrance into the legal profession was one of the best
kept secrets of the year, judging from the number of clients who
beat a path to my door. For approximately a year I considered
various ways and means of declassifying this top secret informa-
tion and on occasion it seemed as if progress was in the offing.
However, in mid 1937 I bade farewell to my prospective clients
and joined the legal staff of the National Labor Relations Board
in Washington. There followed five years of interesting work
and stimulating associations in a new field of law. Most of my
time during this period was devoted to trial work in various areas
of the East and Midwest; and I might add that living out of a
suitcase was a matter of routine.

In 1942, when I began my present association with Sun Life of
America, we moved to Baltimore and after fifteen years we're
beginning to consider ourselves as Baltimoreans. Of course, I
should add that we haven’t lived in Baltimore for the last fifteen
years without interruption. In 1943 1 was commissioned a lieu-
tenant (j.g.) in the Navy and we retraced our steps to Washington
where we lived until early 1946, while I was assigned to the Bureau

followed by thirteen years in Washington, Arizona and California,
logging, sawmilling and selling lumber by-products. My sec-

or tree farming, as a director of companies which own over
100,000 acres of such land.

The family have naturally appropriated a considerable amount
of time. We live on a hillside looking over the vineyards of the
Russian River Valley, fifteen acres of peace and quiet, ‘five minutes
from town, with two Whiteface steers, a Morgan mare and as-
sorted dogs and parakeets. With one child married and two away
at school, life at home is too peaceful. My ever-loving wife tries
unsuccessfully to relieve this peaceful existence with long lists of
dude ranching jobs which are waiting still to be done!

The hobbies I ride are cooking, hunting and reading, in that
order. Roast shoats in the Chinese oven, sour cream waffles,
minestrone, and chicken tarragon are good; black-tail deer re-

In college, if I assisted at Mass once a semester my halo grew
tight; however, I find more and more interest in matters religious
as time progresses. Annual laymen’s retreats have helped in many
ways, as has the inspiring example of a non-Catholic wife teaching
the Baltimore catechism to four young bead rattlers.

with Pacific duty. Medical discharge in 1945, minus two fingers
on the right hand. Needless to say there were many times durin
the 1930's I wished I had chosen some other field of endeavor
than the securities business but in recent years it has certainly
been more rewarding. My favorite sports are sailing and duck
hunting. However, between taxes and the do-it-yourself move-

to the extent I would like. I always used to think that the older
one got life would become less complicated — but how wrong
I was.

AS others have done, so have I. A deadline for tax reports, social
security withholding and English A themes has always found me
trying to catch up at the last possible hour and so far succeeding,
but only. The Class Report has been no exception, so I have
enjoyed the entire series of postcard cartoons from Ruth Ma-
honey and Donald Sullivan, urging me on to greater effort.
After college, four years at Harvard Medical School brought
me the degree of M.D. Internship and residency in surgery at

and intensive years. World War II came, postponing my setting
up in private practice. From 1942 to 1946 I served as a captain
in the Medical Corps, AUS, attached to the Air Force and spent
the entire time in the Air Force Regional Hospital, San Antonio,
Texas, ending up as chief of general surgery. Discharge from
the Army brought a promotion to major. During this period a
bout with polio and thyroid troubles sent me through the gen-
eral hospital retirement boards, ending in retirement from Army
service in 1949. Since the military service, I have engaged in
the private practice of surgery on the south shore of Massachu-
setts.

A trip to Bermuda introduced me to Inez Webster, my wife.
We were married during my hospital training and managed well
on a resident’s salary, something I doubt I could repeat. Judy
was born in Boston and Geoffrey was born in San Antonio, ‘Texas,
during military service. Both are now in the Hingham Public
Schools, with Judy nearing college.

Since our sojourn in Texas at Uncle Sam’s behest, we have
enjoyed several return visits to the Southwest and continue to be
fascinated by that rugged wide open country. We have also re-
turned to Bermuda, with many pleasant memories.

Spare time is always scarce, but each year we manage some for
skiing in the winter and boating in the summer. Most of our
trips and outings have been with both children and have been
more pleasurable thereby. Politically, I have always voted Re-
publican and at present will continue to do so. Religiously, I am
an occasional visitor to the Congregational Church, where my
family has a much better attendance record. The twenty-five
years have passed rapidly. My army service and life in the
Southwest widened my horizon tremendously and we have en-
joyed our postwar living in Hingham and New England all the

more because of it.

and completed the ordeal of a Ph.D. in biology in 1937. The
only sizeable break in that period was a side-trip in 1935 as
ichthyological photographer on Max Fleischmann’s yacht Haida
to the west coast of Mexico. I treasure the memories of Acapulco
and other spots as they were then, and the color pictures we
obtained have stood the test of time and the fishy eye. That first
paycheck allowed for a summer of exploration in England, Ire-
land, Holland and Denmark.

Proudly bearing my newly-acquired doctorate degree, I set
forth on a National Research Council Fellowship for Cambridge
University, England, there to be humbled, instructed, charmed
and warmly befriended for two wonderful years. Jobless, I re-
turned across the Atlantic in 1939 to find haven at Harvard for
a third year of post-doctoral study.

In 1940 I headed westward to take my first academic position
as instructor of botany in the University of California at Berke-
ley. It was a sound and happy move. In that first class was a
lovely music major who later consented to be my wife. The
urgencies of approaching war put me to teaching physics, to
testing poison gases and finally to studying the production of
guayule rubber for nearly three years at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture laboratories in the Salinas Valley. Peter brought a
new slant to our lives in 1944, and at the close of the war we
took up operations again in Berkeley. Grace entered the scene
boisterously in 1949: she is a pretty picture indeed. A sabbatical
leave in 1948-49 saw us all back at Harvard to explore old haunts
and enjoy old hospitalities again. The year 1950 took us to
London and Stockholm for botanical lectures and International
Botanical Congress, and the fun of travel. Several lectures,
committees, and papers later we set forth in 1956 for another
priceless sabbatical, this time in Costa Rica, a country abounding
in natural beauties, kind people and biological fascinations.

So here we are once again back in the Berkeley Hills, fran-
tically opening mail from Harvard, delighting in the sweep of

San Francisco Bay, resisting inducements to return eastward,

thoroughly and happily westerners but always treasuring all
that Harvard and the east has done for us.

IT should, I suppose, be a simple matter to meet the Class Com-
mittee’s eminently reasonable request for an account of one’s life
and times since graduation. In practical fact, when contemplating
this worthy task, my sympathy for those who must read it is
exceeded only by my sense of self-pity at having to write it, But
let us not be deterred from pressing on regardless.

As some of my erstwhile classmates may vaguely recall, I was
lured away from Harvard as a promising member of the Junior
Class in 1931 to join an expedition to China and Tibet. This proved
my undoing (in more ways, perhaps, than one). After nearly two
years of wandering, in and out of trouble, over the Far East, of
climbing peaks, hunting game, mapping a remote area of Central

[315]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

Pusan, cased myself once more out of Korea. Korean affairs con-
tinued thereafter to occupy my attention until the signing of the
Armistice three years later. During this period, I also attended two
sessions of the U.N. General Assembly, i in Paris and New York,
as a member of the U.S. Delegation.

In September of 1953, a new phase began when we flew to
Australia to take up an appointment as First Secretary of Em-
bassy at Canberra. We found the Australians much to our liking
and the next three years passed all too quickly. Trips to New
Guinea, the Great Barrier Reef, Tasmania and Alice Springs,
in the great Central Desert, broke any possibility of monotony,
while a month of fishing and mountain climbing in New Zealand
certainly did nothing to 5 detract from the interest and pleasure of
our sojourn under the Southern Cross.

And now those of you (if any) who have had the perseverance
to stay with this overly-long tale will be only too happy to ob-
serve that it is nearly told. “We are just finishing our first year
in Dublin, where I am Counselor of the Embassy. The trout
fishing is good, the riding excellent, my tennis has been neglected,
but the local supply of unexposed color film is holding out
despite the inroads I have made on it. Our two children are
growing up rapidly and one is already at boarding school in the
States (Dobbs). The Irish are delightful and we are, as usual,
busy.

But where does all this leave us? Well, for me perhaps Tenny-
son expressed it as nearly as anyone, when he wrote:

lam a part of all that I have met;

Yet all experience is an arch wherethro”

Gleams that untravel’d world, whose margin fades
For ever and for ever when I move,

occupation: Textile manufacturing.

ALMOST since college, I have been in textile manufacturing,
mostly in New England. However, I did have a tour of duty
with our company in South Carolina.

I was with the Army Air Corps for three years during the war.
Practically all the time I was at Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio,
where I did textile work on parachutes. Helen and I were lucky
enough to get a furnished house, so that I was virtually a civilian
in uniform,

In 1948 we finally realized that Boston was becoming much too
crowded, especially for my two active young boys. I found
that I was dividing my time between Boston and southern New
Hampshire, and therefore we picked North Andover, on the lake,
near the Brooks School.

I do quite a lot of gardening, tree-pruning, grass cutting, weed-
ing, etc., with tractors, mowers and chain-saws. I find myself i ina
lot of “do-it-yourself” projects. I play baseball, football and ten-
nis with our boys. Occasionally I find time to play some golf.

HIARVARD CLASS OF 1933

rua icaTIONS: Numerous shorter articles in the ficld of internal medicine
and neurology.

I WENT directly to Harvard Medical School in 1933. This
period probably meant more to me than college did, since it
brought me into direct contact with a number of teachers and
students who were then making and have since made many con-
tributions to medicine and society. This probably reflected a late
maturation on my own part; in retrospect the same sort of thing
had been available at the College but I had not seen it. After this
there was some training in medicine at the Peter Bent Brigham
Hospital and in neurology at the Boston City Hospital, and then
the 26th Infantry Division as a battalion surgeon. I shall not for-
get the long hot hours in a Dodge ambulance or sitting around
in a camp in great boredom. It may be a good thing, I think it
is, that the new weapons of destruction shall more or less pre-
clude this sort of existence. If it is now sufficiently clear that
war will uniformly afflict everyone, it may be that we can
proscribe it. Enough of that.
My professional life began thus in Boston after the war, and
I started with Dr. Samuel Gargill in Boston, working in research
part-time with Drs. Jacob Fine, Benjamin Alexander and my
classmate, Arnold Seligman. Professionally, I gradually have
been more and more interested in neurological problems; have
joined Dr. Robert Schwab’s staff at the Massachusetts General
Hospital under Dr. Raymond Adams. In this regard it seems to
me that we now are making fumbling progress into the under-
standing of the actions of the nervous system, and in so doing
are making possible a clearer distinction between those human
difficulties in interhuman relationships (family, friends, society,
professional), and those of the individual. Opportunities lie in
profusion in both directions for advances; I am concerned with
the latter branch of knowledge. Specifically, we have recently
been engaged in a survey of the medical and surgical therapy of
Parkinson’s syndrome. This represents a constellation of diseases
of the motor aspect of the brain, about which we know only
what is seen under the microscope (not much), what some acci-
dentally discovered drugs do (disappointingly little), and what
a rather fortuitously discovered operation on one central nervous

cluster, the globus pallidus will accomplish (a good deal but in
highly selected cases).

A good part of my life is really concerned with living with
a wife and three children, and raising the Jatter. In some respects
my wife has raised me, My own childhood was mixed with a
chambermaid and nurse; these luxuries for the parents have gone
with us as they have for most, I am sure. This means that for me
at least I have a close relationship with my kids, closer than my
father had with me. I can cite five days a week (from 7:15 to
7:45) supervision of Terry’s (son No. 1) piano practice. He has
come along fine and we both have loved it sometimes. The Longy
School is good, but this has been a unique opportunity to work
together. If you add to this, life in a very pleasant suburban
community of 2500, Lincoln, sixteen miles out of Boston, a large
country place, two Irish setters and a Siamese you get a pleasantly
confused maze in which we all live. All of this makes me very
grateful to Harvard though I am not sure how much I shall ex-
press this monetarily.

WENT into the rug business to get enough capital to go into
something else. I haven’t got the money yet. I am still in the

I enrolled with the Class of 1931, and ended up with the Class
of 1933. Two days before graduation, they told me I lacked
one-half credit. My degree is still being held up until the short-
age is made up. (Off the record, I lacked more than just a half
credit, or what college credits represented. It took two years
in the Army to prepare me for graduation on top of four years
in college and three years around the Yard and in the stacks of
Widener Library.) Having been saturated with liberal arts, I
appreciate and covet a scientific background — even that of an
automobile mechanic.

The only group I belong to, outside of Church, is my family.
I consider the raising (not the begetting) of my three children
as the only achievement of my twenty-five years since. I am
looking forward to the next twenty-five with the same eager
naiveté as I had when they told me I had to go through life
lacking one-half credit of having a degree.

occupaTION: Manager, Atlanta Sub-Branch, Ingersoll-Rand Company.
MEMBER OF: Georgia Engineering Society; North Side Civic Association;
Atlanta Athletic Club.

JUST in case some folks don’t remember it, 1933 was part of a

period in our economic life when any job was a good job. I

felt fortunate to start with E. G. Budd Company in Philadelphia,

shortly after graduation. A year later Ingersoll-Rand Company
accepted an offer of my services. A routine training course
through the three factories was followed by a stint in the New

York general offices, and now Georgia and South Carolina. Sales

work which requires proper engineering for product applica-

tion has proved sufficiently varied and stimulating to qualify
for my vocation.

The transfer to Pittsburgh was arranged by fate for there I
renewed a Radcliffe acquaintance and Cupid took over complet-
ing his work in September of 1936. We have had our share of
health, both good and bad; times, mostly good, but some a bit
trying. Our lives have been wrapped up to a very great degree
in our family and the raising of our two children. Philip is now
a freshman at Duke University and Ann a freshman in high
school. As parents we have relived with them the last few years
of their lives with as much pleasure, far less abandon and much
more apprehension than they have.

Politically a Democrat, disappointed that principles under
which the party was founded have not been followed, A return
to strict interpretation of the constitution and the conservation
of the rights of the states would be a welcome shift. The grow-
ing size of the Federal Government with its ever-expanding
control over most of our “rights” is increasingly socialistic and
could lead eventually to dictatorship. I hope we awaken to the

peril in time to stop the trend.

A long dormant religious conviction was revived in the 1940's
and since then I have been active in the Peachtree Road Pres-
byterian Church, serving as deacon, 1955-57.

Golf at present is the only outside activity which might pos-
sibly be classified as a hobby. I thoroughly enjoy the game and

the companionship while hacking away to about a twelve handi-

Cap.

WITHOUT premeditation we found ourselves living in Cali-
fornia in 1956, thus completing the pilgrimage by slow stages
across the country via Minnesota, Cambridge, Akron, Syracuse,
Akron and Los Angeles.

Although a skin test once revealed I was allergic to rubber,

I have been with Firestone since graduation. My last sixteen
years have been devoted entirely to procurement and, with Fire-
stone’s fifteen-fold sales increase since 1933, it has been the equiva-
lent of working in five or six different fields — plastics, metals,
ordnance, fuel cells, guided missiles and, of course, rubber.
- In California a major part of my work is with our Guided
Missile Division, a complex situation from any angle. I have just
finished a course in Aircraft Purchasing prepared by Harbridge
House, given by UCLA using the case study method. So the
educational arm of our college stretches this far. Next on the
list will be an Executive Aircraft Industry Purchasing Course
soon to be given for the first time, also prepared by the ubiquitous
Harbridge House.

Prior to leaving Akron, I enjoyed and was stimulated by the
privilege of interviewing many of the prospective Harvard boys
from the local high schools. This is an experience I would recom-
mend to all who may not realize what it takes to be accepted
these days. Now we are about to launch a Harvard Club of

appears to be sufficient enthusiasm, I have run the usual gamut
of children’s organizations with more yet to come, I fear. I must
confess most of my own enjoyment comes from doing things

Lately this has too often not progressed beyond the planning

SINCE graduating from Harvard Law School, I have been living
on the family farm in Butler County, Pennsylvania, and practis-
ing law in the city of Pittsburgh about fifteen miles away. For
most of this time I was associated with a rather large firm, but
recently I have been in practice by myself. The latter state has
many advantages, but one of them is not the financial rewards.

My war record was about average and certainly not very spec-
tacular, I was commissioned in the Naval Reserve in the fall of
1941 and was called to active duty as a lieutenant (j.g.) two
days after Pearl Harbor. I served in various assignments until
my discharge as lieutenant commander in October, 1945. My
longest and best assignment was as flag lieutenant to the com-
mandant in Bermuda.

I am sure that my travels, hobbies and social, political and re-
ligious convictions are about average for the Class of 1933 and
could be nothing but a bore to recite.

AFTER a stint of free-lance foreign corresponding and a series
of jobs with various newspapers, I became editor of the now
defunct Quincy, Massachusetts, News and from there moved
on to work for Charles Scribner’s Sons in New York City.
After a year with Scribner’s I organized with Lynn Carrick, a
Princetonian, a book publishing firm, Carrick & Evans, which
kept me occupied until World War II when I was called up
as a reserve officer.

I had the good fortune of serving with the General Staff
briefly and then with the First U.S. Infantry Division in its cam-
paigns in Sicily and across the continent of Europe. After a brief
stint again with the General Staff, 1 went off active duty with the
Army to work for the Department of State where I was assistant
to the Director General of Foreign Service in Washington and
then public affairs officer, Director of USIS, and Cultural At-
taché in Athens, Greece. Accepting a regular army commission
in 41947, J first saw service with Headquarters European Com-
mand in Frankfurt and Heidelberg where I was joined by Jane
and the two girls, Returning from Germany, I was Deputy Chief

of Staff at Fort Dix and then had the Third Battalion of the 39th
Infantry before going to the Armed Forces Staff College at Nor-
folk, Virginia.

For some reason I have never understood I was then assigned
to the Munitions Board in Washington where I attempted to
program vast quantities of things for vast sums of money, for an
hypothetical future. With the demise of the Munitions Board
I moved to the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3, Depart-
ment of the Army, and worked on mobilization planning, after
which I went to the Army War College at Carlisle, Pennsyl-
vania. .

The pleasant life at Carlisle terminated with what appeared
to be an unlikely assignment to the Military Assistance Advisory
Group in Saigon, Viet-Nam. Although all my life I have resented
people telling me about the Orient and forcing me to look at
slides, I became a typical enthusiast for the Extreme Orient.
Remembering my past feelings, however, I have not made people
sit in dark rooms and look for hours at pictures of little temples.
Instead, I hand them books of photographs which at least they
can ruffle through in a polite ten minutes.

Returning from Viet-Nam, I wound up assigned to the Office
of the Secretary of Defense in International Security Affairs
where I presently occupy myself as an “expert” on the smaller
Southeast Asia countries. |

I still play a moderately good game of tennis and squash, but
I find I talk them better than I play them now.I dine out on
stories of having been on the last voyage of the Andrea Doria, a
crossing I completed on the Ile de France.

I find my weekends consumed with visits to horse shows, where
my youngest daughter wins reserve championships, or visits to
the little place in Bearsville, New York, to which we have always
been able to return despite our wanderings around the world.

HARVARD BROTHER: Horace Everett, Jr., 31.

occupation: Air transportation; publications editor, supervise the editing
of all company manuals.

ALTHOUGH my life has been a rather commonplace one, |
have had the pleasure of growing up, so to speak, with a twentieth
century industry — air transportation. My first job after gradu-
ation, however, was not in the airline business. It was teachin
at the Berkshire School, a boys’ preparatory school in the south-
west corner of Massachusetts. For two years I did my best to
impart to my sophomore students a little knowledge of English
grammar and plane geometry. Why I was assigned to teach such
unrelated subjects I do not recall. All I know is that I was mighty
glad to have a job at the time. In addition to my teaching duties,
I coached the varsity hockey and soccer teams with moderate
success and a great deal of pleasure.

In June of 1936, I learned that American Airlines was looking
for someone to work in its reservations office in Boston. With-
out any idea of what the airline business would be like, but with
an equally vague feeling that I did not want to teach all my
life, l applied for the job with American and got it.

Now I am glad that I was led to enter the air transportation
business, It has been a rewarding and sometimes thrilling ex-
perience to work in such a rapidly expanding industry. I have
watched the airlines progress in twenty years from fabric-
covered, two-engine planes to huge four-engine, shining metal
transports, from only a handful of passengers per plane to eighty
or more. And now we are on the verge of the jet age and,
who knows, even the age of space travel,

My first three years with American were spent in the reserva-

{ 332 J

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

tions office at the East Boston Airport. The most memorable
event during that period was the 1938 New England hurricane.
American Airlines was the only means of transportation available
between Boston and New York for many days. I remember
the thirty-six hour tours of duty trying to handle the deluge of
persons clamoring for reservations to New York and west, the
extra crews flown in from all over our system to help, and the
other airlines that were invited to fly the route to help carry
passengers and cargo.

In 1939 I was transferred to the general offices in New York to
help develop and write reservation procedures for the entire
airline, I have remained in the regulations and procedures field
ever since. My present job of supervising the editing of all of the
company’s manuals gives me an exciting panorama of our entire
airline operation.

Because of my job in an essential industry I was kept out of
active participation in World War II, but I contributed my small
bit on the side lines, so to speak.

Fortunately, my working with an airline has made it possible
for me and my family to see some of the U.S.A., outside of New
York City, and we hope in the next few years to see even more
of it.

In the field of politics I would place myself a little to the right
of center, but my opinions on individual political issues may
swing further either way. Neither the Republicans nor the
Democrats have won my entire allegiance! I prefer to vote for
the man and the issue rather than the party.

The most important event in my life has been my conversion
to the Catholic faith. A strong belief in God had been given to
me by my parents, but somehow I did not have any conception
of what such a belief meant. Now I know what it means, and
with that knowledge has come a clear understanding of the pur-

ose of life and a greater pleasure in the living of it.

My love of the outdoors remains strong, but like many things
I don’t get as frequent chances to enjoy it as I would like.

He’s taking French this year and doing well. Swimming is his real
sport and I was never happier than when I watched him swim
at the Balmoral in Miami and win a cup. So, other than the prac-

little girl who, like Teddy R., speaks softly but wields a big

wonderful mother and a lot of fun.

IN the headlong rush of today’s living, I am brought up short
with this request for a backward look. It’s been a long time
since I have put my feet up on the desk, tilted back my chair
and just looked into space reminiscing. It began in the Depres-
sion, and twenty-five years later it seems to be just about the same.

On finishing college I started in the retail dress business and
I'm still at it, ” First it was a year in a Toledo department store.
Then it was off to Fort Wayne, Indiana, to open a store of my
own. Finally back to Toledo in 1936 to open a dress shop in
partnership with my father.

In that same year I married the Toledo girl I had been going
with since graduation, Andrea came along in 1939. Dick, in

1940. When the War started, I was called up and just as quickly
turned down. With most and best of the young manpower
gone, I was pressed into leadership of various local Jewish com-
munal organizations. I have maintained these activities ever since,
and they demand a good part of my time.

I find relaxation in puttering around with things I know nothing
about. I usually have a project going, and over the years these
have been things like building a boat, cooking, remodeling a
kitchen, assembling a hi-fi set. Right now it’s aquariums for
tropical fish.

Unfortunately, my wife was afflicted with multiple sclerosis
some ten years ago, and these past five years she has been con-
fined to the house in a wheel chair. That is a rough deal. Our
daughter, Andrea, is in her freshman year at Chatham College in
Pittsburgh. Our son, Dick, is a high school senior and it looks
like the University of Michigan for him next year.

That’s it for twenty-five years. And how I would like to keep
my feet upon this desk and just laze away even the rest of this
day. But there’s a committee meeting at lunch; there’s a sales-
man coming in at 2:00; there’s a board meeting at 8:00. [Id bet-
ter snap to it and get back to work.

AFTER knocking about in a number of jobs I finally became
associated with General Electric just before the war and am
glad to be in its employ. When one starts putting down all the
features he would most like in a job, he comes pretty close to
describing one with General Electric.

My elder son is now a junior at Harvard and has just dis-
covered that football can be fun when played in the House
league. This proves that he is a year more advanced than I was,
for I didn’t learn it until my senior year. My younger son is not
interested in Harvard, and his high school marks attest that Har-
vard would be equally disinterested. He hopes to attend a good
art school; I hope he makes it.

After a two-year sea-duty stint during World War II, I came |
home determined that my sons should not be quite so ignorant
of the sea at their doorstep as I was. So we bought a Town Class
(16%4-foot) sailboat as a starter, intending to graduate to an
auxiliary sailing cruiser in due time. We have never graduated
but have had fun trying to win races in a highly competitive fleet
although we have never enjoyed high rating.

Sailing in the summer and Masonic and church work in the
other seasons have kept me busy the past few years, but I hope
that I may now have more time to pursue other interests. Chief
interest —my wife.

Television Engineers.

THIS biographical sketch can neither be so honest and personal
that it can only be published posthumously, nor so framed in ex-
citing events that the personal side becomes merely local color.
It can only be a routine recording of a rather routine history.
First my commercial life —the way I make a living is interest-
ing to me and occasionally quite rewarding. It probably is of little
interest to others. I am doing specifically what I always intended
to do even before I graduated from college. I wanted to delve into
the whys and wherefores, the techniques and mechanisms of the
photographic process and apply this knowledge commercially.
I do not know why this particular field attracted and intrigued
me — suffice to say that it did then and does now. I majored in
chemistry, later adding some chemical engineering via Columbia
University. My first job, in 1934, was chief (and only) chemist
with Ace Film Laboratories, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers
Pictures, located in Brooklyn, New York. The old Vitagraph
studios were still standing but used as maintenance shops. The
Vitaphone shorts were ground out at the rate of two a week
and glamor was sloshing all over the place. After three years
of this, I realized the spell had worn off and I could see that
chemists had less of a future than stage carpenters in the motion
picture business — and weren't as well paid. In 1937 I joined the
Agfa Ansco Corporation in Binghamton, New York. Experience
in Quality Control, Production, Research and Development led
to my present position as director of Product and Process de-
velopment of the Ansco Division of General Aniline and Film
Corporation. In spite of the occasional frustrations there is

[ 338 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

nothing I would rather be doing day-in and day-out. It has
paid off in such huge satisfactions as seeing men in my depart-
ment devise and reduce to commercial practice the fastest color
film in the world.

During the years I have separated more and more my personal
family life from my business life — geographically, emotionally
and physically. This enables me to minimize the rather boring
and annoying tribal rites of the “American businessman.” We
live twenty-five miles away from Binghamton in a community
where Ansco has no more immediacy than General Electric. We
have a large old house that’s constantly being modernized but
stoutly resisting every step. Two acres of land provide, through
studied neglect, some wonderful jungles and wilderness for our
three progeny. We used to fly our own light plane but now
find camping with the children more rewarding. When time
permits us to do so, we enjoy a bit of fishing and small game
hunting. Cub scouting and Brownies, P.T.A., and all the other
things we are swept into preempt the time that hobbics used to
fill.

Now about my convictions. Over the years I have become in-
creasingly concerned with ideas, principles, abstractions — at the
expense of a concern with things. The importance of the in-
dividual as an individual has taken on greater and greater mean-
ing. I abhor the social and business pressures that force one to-
ward professing belief in a recognized religious sect, belonging to
a recognized political party, taking & part in approved community
projects, and behaving socially in an acceptably stylized manner.
All of these pressures weaken individualism or at least keep it
within neatly prescribed bounds. Yet we depend on individual
creativity for our very way of life.

As a member of our local School Board, I have taken some
pleasure in encouraging intellectual honesty, embarrassing as it
occasionally is. Also I have found how flexible most people’s
convictions are. A pet project is the placing of far more emphasis
on developing the individual’s critical judgment to protect him
from the onslaught of constantly multiplying, mass communica-
tion media.

My religious convictions have become deeper though still too

free to fit in neatly with any organized church. The paradox of

[ 339 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

preaching the merits of meekness while proclaiming man as God’s
greatest handiwork still amuses me. However, I am raising my
children in the accepted Sunday School tradition for their cul-
tural discipline.

Finally, the intellectual honesty demanded by Harvard, the
intellectual curiosity encouraged by Harvard, and the emphasis
on an education embracing our entire cultural heritage, have
proven to be foods that stick to the ribs throughout life. I am
proud of the leadership that Harvard continues to provide toward
education for our free society.

UNTIL bombarded by Class requests these last few weeks, the
idea that I was about to become an old man of twenty-five years
out had not occurred to me. To my own satisfaction, at least,
I seem to do what I always have done. Possibly others would
disagree. Physically, I wear the same size suit despite redistributed
poundage noted by the discerning eye. My college grey hair has
become largely white.

Professionally, right from college I attended Harvard Law
School during the school year and worked in boys’ camps dur-
ing the summers. Originally, I had thought a government Federal
Trade Commission attorney was a great goal. However, at the
end of the three-year law school span and “passing the Bar”
(admitted to Massachusetts and Federal Bars), I had washed so
many windows, shoveled so many walks and worked for so many

people in dear old Cambridge, I was naive enough to hope some
might become clients, (Some did.) Accordingly, I went to work
in private practice in Boston. I never have regretted it.

The profession has been good to me. My partners in Haus-
sermann, Davison and Shattuck have been tolerant, understand-
ing and generous. My profession has been, and is, challenging;
it is fun. I would not trade any of it. As time went on, I became
particularly interested in trusts and estate planning. The art of
working out a protective and tax saving plan with and for a
family group——and later administering it—is fascinating. I
like to think it is constructive. Great numbers of my clients are
individual people. To merit their confidence and respect is a
challenge.

In due time I came to address many and far-flung groups of
lawyers, bankers and insurance advisors in this estate planning
ficld. Finally, I put some of my theories, study results and ex-
perience into a book, An Estate Planner’s Handbook, second edi-
tion (Shattuck and Farr); this work had been begun with my
late partner Mayo A. Shattuck. This, too, has been fun — but, oh,
so much work! In due time, also, I have found myself on my share
of corporation boards.

Philosophically, I have felt we all owe of our time, talent and
titles to something bigger than ourselves. In my case, this has
taken several general forms:

s. Civic. Since the early forties, I have had an active part in
the city manager proportional representation government move-
ment in Cambridge. As a great volunteer team, we believe we have
had a hand in much good to and for the city. At times it was
exciting,

2. Social. In the larger sense of social, I have worked with
boys and youth. For over ten years I have been president of a
great board of the Cambridge YMCA; here we have raised a
half million dollars and built a great plant; here we serve thou-

sands of people annually. Also, in the larger sense of social, I
have found it challenging to work on various hospital, home
and guidance beards. In the more narrow — more pure — sense,
although unmarried, it seems possible for me to find companion-
ship and participate in, and even serve, several clubs and functions.

3. Government service. Being single (and young!) I was early

[ 342 ]

draft bait. I served four years to the day in the U.S. Coast Guard
— an efficient branch of the Armed Services which goes out when
it is too rough for some of the others! Here I learned that there
are some great men who come from west of Dedham.

4. Religious. Why the Class is interested in this aspect, I don’t
know. It has been my lot to have been active in my own Meth-
odist denomination in the local church, at the state level and on
national boards. Whether this is not more because of availability,
I never was quite sure. For about four years I served as vice-
president and director of the Massachusetts Council of Churches.

5. Hobbies. A little golf; a little checkers; a lot of reading,
friends and conversation. I have managed to hold my position
on the Y varsity volley ball team all these years!

6. -Where one classifies Masonry in the Class list, I don’t know.
It certainly is neither hobby nor religion, yet the values and
service are manifest on every hand. It has been my good fortune
to have received all thirty-two degrees, to have served as master
of The Harvard Lodge, as district deputy grand master and to
take an active part in the Scottish Rite degrees. Here, again, we
find men of good will, fun and good works.

7. Politically. Iam an enrolled Republican but would be classed
as an Independent.

What does all this add up to? I don’t know. This I do know:
a law profession is work and not particularly remunerative; if
one gains the honest respect of his clients, the profession is con-
structive; it is fun; if one seasons it all with some service, time,
talent and money for things bigger than himself, it all seems

worth while.

accvpaTion: Dentist, self-employed.

orrices HELD: President, Rotary Club, 1947, New Hampshire Dental So-
ciety, since 1950, member, Board of Education, 1950-57, Board of
Health, 1954-57; trustee, Y.\.C.A.; past president, Central Council,

FOLLOWING the second year, I left college to enter dental
school. In most respects, this was a wise decision, but new 1in-
terests and new loyalties soon replaced those associated with the
Class of ’33. Except for a few of the fellows whom I meet
through other class interests, I am really a stranger, but for an
occasion such as this, even the strangers should report!

Near the end of my first year in dental, I met The Girl and
soon after we were married. The next three years are memorable
in that we never had any extra money but always had a wonder-
ful time. My Catherine deserves much credit for she continued
to hold down a job through the depression and I graduated on
schedule in 1935. We took stock then and decided to set up
practice in a strange state and town. We came here to Ports-
mouth, New Hampshire, and here we have remained except for
three war years when I served in the Navy. Our family now
includes three children who seem extra-special to us for they are
adopted. Catherine, 2d, is now ready for college and the twins,
Bill and John, are ready for Junior High.

Perhaps to compensate for the barren years, our major interests
scem to be child-centered. Any husband whose wife worked for
twenty years in Scouts will know what I mean. Then along came
Cubs and now Boy Scouts, P.T.A., plus “Y” and church. The
pattern is familiar.

In addition, I found time after earning a living to serve seven
years as an officer in my dental society and have finished eight
years on a Board of Education. By this time next year, I shall
have served twenty years in the Naval Reserve. When that time
comes, I shall plan to turn in my suit, having other places to
spend that one night a week that we drill!

In conclusion, I am confident, having already celebrated a
twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, that we can accept the chal-

IN filing this Class Report I note with misgivings the generous
spaces (blanks) allotted to Offices Held, Memberships and Publi-
cations. What a paucity of achievement. My father’s Twenty-
fifth Anniversary Report, Class of 87, was well rounded out, and
I have to think of my children thumbing through this volume till
they come to the letter “F.” It doesn’t, somehow, seem appro-
priate here to mention years of service with Little League Base-
ball and determined small boys who always throw behind the
runner or other failures including Cub Scouts and a multiplicity
of local charity drives.

Five years with Faulkner & Colony Manufacturing Company,
two years with Diehl Manufacturing Company and eleven years
with Johns-Manville would bring me up-to-date if it weren’t for
World War II. Briefly, I served as a second lieutenant of foot
and was invalided out at St. Malo, France, in 1944. These years
have always found me voting the G.O.P. ticket and usually in
the minority, which has put me in the happy position of being

THERE may be a way of personally reviewing the past quarter
of a century without mentioning the Great Depression — but I
don’t know how. The unemployment and world tensions met
on graduation affected all of us. My trial-and-error job gauntlet
started in a department store in Boston; went through selling
autos in San Antonio; then out to a pipe-laying stretch in the
oil fields of California. Temporary jobs followed each other
quickly through theatre management, studio labor gangs, pub-
licity, and finally into writing in the motion picture industry.

The first five years after graduation were rough ones. I didn’t
like them, and I don’t like them now in retrospect. I don’t think
I relaxed with any feeling of security until 1938. That was the
year things started to pick up . .. America was helping Britain
rearm .. . people started making money . . . and the economic
indices in the Wall Street Journal started moving up. The De-
pression was over! The fat years were on the land... or so
we thought.

In 1940, I was enjoying life as a writer at Warner Bros. studio
when that telegram arrived. The one signed ULIO.. . notify-
ing me that the R.O.T.C. commission | was too young to receive
at graduation was now in effect... that I was a first lieutenant
in the Signal Corps .. . assigned to the Photographic Center,
Astoria, Long Island... for the production of training films.
I spent forty undergraduate months at Tfarvard —and fifty in
the Army. I never saw a foreign country or heard a shot fired
in anecr ,,. but I Icarned a lot of what there was to know

[ 344 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

about documentary film-making. Because my original com-
mission was in Artillery, I was made O.1.C. of all training films
for the Field Artillery, Coast Artillery and Tank Destroyer
branches. If complaints are in order, my address is above.

In 1945 I was separated from the service as a major in New
York, and joined the Music Corporation of America in charge
of writers. Three months of meeting eastern publishers and
producers, then home to California, with my bride, to represent
M.C.A. stories and writers to the motion picture industry.

I left M.C.A. two years later to become a story editor at
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. But this was the time L. B. Mayer
started his fight with the board of directors. Production of
Metro features was first stymied and then completely halted
during this internecine warfare.

One of my former M.C.A. clients asked the conditions under
which I would return to the agency business. A week later ten
writers bet $20,000 on my ability to guide their destinies in the
Hollywood jungle-— and the Bernard Feins Literary Agency
was launched. Among other publishers represented was Boston’s
Houghton Mifflin and Little, Brown & Company. Things went
well from the very start: backers’ risk capital was returned in
ten months; and for five years I represented and guided some of
the better writers in the motion picture industry, and helped
launch such T’V programs as “Gunsmoke” and “Line-Up.”

In May, 1956, I sold my agency assets, and joined Paramount
Studios in charge of their Story and Writing Departments.
Since Paramount enjoyed basic contracts with Sophia Loren,
Audrey Hepburn and Bill Holden, material for these box-office
personalities is my immediate concern. To help in this search,
we have offices staffed with professional readers in New York,
London, Paris, Berlin and Rome. These act as local funnels into
which is moved everything of literary or dramatic value. These
funnels end at my department in Hollywood, where each play,
book or novel is read and daily considered for Paramount’s pro-
duction needs,

So much for itemized history. Most of our spare time is spent
at the desert at Palm Springs, It’s only two hours away on a
fast freeway, and: it provides a wonderful way of recharging
the battery — while we slowly turn into sun-worshipping lizards.

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

I find myself wishing each class were asked to evaluate, twenty-
five years later, the good and the bad of its undergraduate activ-
ities and how they withstood a quarter-century test of facing
reality. For instance, I’d make public speaking a compulsory
course at Cambridge. I'd vote for personal sports rather than
spectator sports. I could have used undergraduate courses in
investments, taxes, insurance and business law.

There is an old expression that everybody has two businesses —
his own and the motion picture business, Those of us in the
picture industry have only one; it is all-consuming and tends to
make us insular in outlook and interest. Our hobbies and char-
ities are tied up with the picture industry, and many of our
social activities are semi-professional in nature.

That brings us up to date. This is no place to discuss the “rumor-
tism” currently plaguing our industry . . . a falling box-office

. of free TV vs. fee TV. Today, twenty-five years after
graduation, we are once more struggling against world tensions,
rising joblessness, Sputniks and a declining stock market. Ironic?
As the French say, Plus Ca Change, Plus C’est La Méme Chose.

IT’S either horrible or wonderful, depending on how you look
at it, but after twenty-five years I find myself probably typical
of ten times ten thousand Men of Harvard. In recent years I’ve
paid pretty close attention to my business, now under heavy fire
due to the revolution in distribution that has reached its greatest
extent in the food industry. (You'll all be getting it soon, boys —
there is no hiding place.) Raising our children and keeping them
healthy have kept Gertrude and me busy. Bachelors may drop

me a line for details; others will understand. Usual run of com-
munity activities. Vacation trips on schedule, Lots of golf. (?'m
married to the club champion. Don’t do it, chaps, Very frustrat-
ing.) Reading, music, theatre, flirting at cocktail parties, smart
talk with the people who have re-built old barns. And putting on
weicht.

After graduation I went to the Harvard Law School and three
years later I was admitted to the bar in both New York and
New Jersey. I worked in a law office in Newark until 1939 when
I entered the fur business (A. Hollander & Sons, Inc., of which
my late father and my uncle were both officers), Due to my fam-
ily status, I was not in the armed forces. In 1943, I returned to
Middletown and entered my late father-in-law’s business, then
known as the Levinson Produce Co., Inc. Upon his demise, I
succeeded to the full ownership of the firm and later changed its
name to M.C. Fenning & Co., Inc., expanding its activities to
include the distribution of frozen foods and other specialties.
In 1951, I acquired a 507 interest in A.H. Gildersleeve & Son,
Inc., a similar business in Kingston, N.Y.

Our daughter Beth was graduated from the Baldwin School in
Bryn Mawr, Pa., in 1957 and is now in her first year at the School
of Fine Arts of Syracuse University. Billy is in the sixth grade
and is looking forward to entering Harvard in 1964.

I am a Conservative. What turns a college Liberal into a Con-
servative after twenty-five years and what kind of a Conserva-
tive does he become? Some Conservatives are just fellows who
clip coupons and like it. But there is an intelligent and quite
objective conservatism that comes from functioning closer to the
realities than we did in 1933. Once, when a liberal friend said,
“Mort is just bitter because of his contacts with the Teamsters’
Union,” I replied, “Disqualification by experience. Guilty.” I
suppose, then, that the inevitable pragmatism of the business
world tends to turn a man’s footsteps toward the right, quite apart
from the profit motive. A more important factor is the skepticism
born of observing the changing world in two and a half decades
— the clouding of the once crystal-clear absolutes, the grisly end-
products of forces which in our youth smelled so clean and fresh.
Twenty-five years ago the catechism read: 1. Who causes wars?
The Munitions Makers (with overtones of evil capitalism).

[ 350 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

Why does Labor strike? For a living wage and, above all, for
security. 3. Why is there so much unrest in Asia, Africa and the
Middle East? Western Imperialism. Set these struggling masses
free and they will be beautiful. 4. What do the communists
want? Obviously, a better world. What if they break a few
heads? In 1958, how the answers differ! Differ, that is, if any
answers can now be given to these or a thousand other questions
that still plague the world. Yet still liberalism marches on. For
each decade there is a new catechism which the Conservative
must continue to find unacceptable.

I know it is not necessary to explain to Harvard men, as it often
is to others, that, as the Liberal is not a Communist or even a
fellow-traveler, neither is the Conservative a reactionary who
hates and fears all attempts to build a better world. The Con-
servative’s enthusiasm in this crusade, however, is tempered by
his pragmatism and skepticism, both of which are founded in
the irresistible logic of recent history. Yet the Conservative has
abundant tolerance and understanding for the weaknesses and
aspirations of the common man, for whom the Liberal has af-
fection only vis-a-vis the capitalist. And, above all, the Conserva-
tive embraces constitutional democracy — constitutional, to pro-
tect all minorities (silk toppers as well as soap box orators) from
the temporary compulsion of the current catechism; and deoc-
racy, because it is the only way of life that permits the automatic
dissipation of Error and Fury.

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

WHIEN I was offered a very subordinate position at Houghton
Mitilin’s Riverside Press in 1934, little did I realize that publishing
was to become my life work. The new job was attractive more
because it gave me an opportunity to leave uninspiring work
with Macy's in New York than because it supplied a chance to
learn about the graphic arts at the most elementary level.

I spent a year in the publisher’s Cambridge manufacturing
plant and Boston office before being dispatched to Michigan and
later northern Illinois as a textbook salesman for the Educational
Department. Shortly after the outbreak of World War II I began
a three-and-a-half year hitch in the Army which carried me
through three major engagements in the Pacific Ocean Area as a
captain with the 77th Division Artillery,

Two years after rejoining my former employer in educational
sales work in Chicago, I returned to Boston to help establish
a new department for the publishing of standardized educational
and psychological tests. Part of my preparation was a stimulat-
ing summer in graduate work at Columbia University. The new
department proved to be a profitable venture, as a result of
which, in 1956, I became a member of the board of directors
and, a year later, the managing editor of the Educational Depart-
ment.

A quarter of a century spent working with the printed word
has been a rewarding experience. I am proud to be associated with
that branch of publishing which is vitally concerned with the
education of the country’s young people. The publishing in-
dustry as a whole, and especially the educational publishers of
which Houghton Mifflin is one of the leaders, has dedicated it-
self to the preparation of American youth for respected citizen-
ship in the community, state, nation and world. Educational

publishers are providing new and effective learning tools to meet
today’s challenge; it is up to the public to give its support to the
program for accelerated and expanded facilities for the education
of all our people.

While working in the Middle West, I married Elizabeth Suther-
land of Glencoe, Illinois, We have three fine children: a boy
who is graduating (I hope) from Belmont Hill School in June;

a girl in the ninth grade of Concord Academy; and another boy
in the fifth grade, also at Belmont Hill, Our home in Belmont is

[352]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

within easy commuting distance of my Boston office and the
other departments in Cambridge and Burlington. An old house
near Gilmanton Iron Works, New Hampshire, is headquarters
for summers which pass too quickly and for an occasional winter
weekend. The last two years our vacations have been spent in
the British Isles, motoring leisurely through the remote highlands
of Scotland one year, and the next through the west of England
and the north of Wales.

I consider myself to be one of the fortunate members of my
generation. Not only have I been blessed with a healthy and
happy family, but I am also able to lead the kind of life I want
to lead and to do the kind of work I am interested in doing.
Could one ask for anything more?

AFTER ten years as manager of the D.H. Brigham Company,

journs across the Peace Bridge to the Canadian sand dunes along
Lake Erie.

In 1954, I became manager of L. Bamberger’s branch depart-

ment store will, in a very short time, perforce, “make one an

atleved attributes, I was over-awed at the casual parade of geniuses
I saw every day on Nassau Street.

One of the catchers trying out for the Princeton baseball team,
cither a good public relations man or a poor backstop, used to
allow my two sons, ages eleven and twelve and a half, to shag
missed balls, and this led to disquieting questions about the ab-
solute minimum requirements to get into that institution. In or-
der to overcome this heresy, I took two days off and went with
the boys in June, 1957, to Cambridge to see Class Day and Com-
mencement. Since Harvard won the baseball game, some in-
roads were made.

I spend as much time as possible on our abandoned farm in
Monson, Mass., where the only growing stock at this time is
20,000 evergreens emerging from seedlings which were obtained
from the State under a re-forestation plan.

Though the Cold War is likely to go on for years, my faith
in the future compels me to go along with the epitaph of a sena-
tor in a New England church yard which claims that today is
better than yesterday and tomorrow will be better than today.

THOSE of you who knew me in college as one of those peculiar
combination Engineering and Business School students will
wonder at my present occupation. Whether Harvard prepared
me adequately for life on a cattle ranch still remains to be seen.

These twenty-five years divide themselves into two parts; in-
dustrial and agricultural. After two years of graduate work in
Engineering and Business, I was lucky to land with The Budd
Co., who needed a young engineer with a good knowledge of
French. After a break-in period I was shipped to Paris where
I spent two fascinating years as technical representative. I re-
turned to Philadelphia in 1937, and was given various engineer-
ing assignments. In 1942, I became Plant Engineer. During the
war years our job was to design the tools and layout facilities
for the manufacture of the company’s many products, ranging
from bazookas to stainless steel airplanes, At one time we had
Over goo engineers and draftsmen working in our department.
In some ways the reconversion period which followed the war
was even more difficult than the war years because of the press
of getting back into automotive and railway car production.

In 1943, at the advanced age of 31 when all my friends had
given me up as a lost cause, I married Clarissa Wells, sister of
classmate Richard C. Wells. We settled down to a very con-

[355 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

ventional suburban life on the Main Line; squash racquets and
tennis at the Merion Cricket Club, Philadelphia orchestra, and the
Jersey shore for summer weekends.

It was in 1949 that we made the big decision of our lives. Both
my brother Stanton (31), a research physiologist at Wright
Field, and I were getting fed up with city life. We had always
wanted to go into a venture together, and though we both had
good jobs, we resigned, burned our bridges and headed west
that summer. In seven days we saw seven ranches, and really
knowing nothing whatsoever about any of them, picked out the
one which we thought we liked the best; thereupon made a deal.

We landed in Steamboat Springs with our families on Novem-
ber 1, 1949. It is hard to imagine the uphill struggle we have had,
especially the first two years. The ranch was in poor shape
and would not produce anything close to what the real estate
man said it would. In spite of this and a declining market for our
product, we love the outdoor life, the management of the cattle,
the experimentation with new methods and the never-ending
improvement of our land and herd. Roping a calf at full gallop
still doesn’t come easy and Harvard didn’t teach me how to
shoe a horse! It is a tough life both physically and mentally — and
don’t think there isn’t a schedule to meet! — but we are gratified
by the sense of independence inherent in this type of work.

Our three boys (13, 11 and 10) and little girl (7) take active
part in the ranch work, helping with the haying (the oldest two
drive tractors), milking the cows, and moving and checking the
cattle. They go to a two-room school house, often on horseback,
two miles from the ranch. This is snow country and winter
comes early. There is snow on the ground now, November 1st,
and it doesn’t leave us until the end of April. The long winter
has its advantages because our outside activities are restricted
mostly to feeding the cattle those 25,000 bales of hay we labori-
ously put up during the summer. We all ski; in fact, we have our
own tow right on our back pasture. This is the season when we
find more time for music and other hobbies. Our string quartet
(minus a cello) meets quite regularly.

For a change in the summer we take off for the high mountain
country for two or three days of fishing. Big game hunting in

the fall is something new for me and I find I like it. Even though

AFTER graduation my efforts to find a spot in the world of
engineering came to nothing — no such demand as we have to-
day. I am often reminded of this when striving to secure en-
gineering talent for my company from today’s graduating classes.
I finally landed a job in Pittsburgh, inspecting bridges. I was
joined in this project by a number of other graduates with no
experience, several from our class. After, in this manner, con-
tributing a small something to the safety of the citizens of that
great city I returned to the place of my birth and joined the
family corporation where I have been in various capacities ever
since.

My hobbies are golf, hunting and fishing. Considering the op-
portunities offered in this area for these fine activities, it is a
pity there is not enough time to devote to them. It appears I
Shall have to wait for retirement to become an expert at golf and
I hope the rumor telling us that it can be played at almost any age

AFTER 1933, with the summit behind me and no possible direc-

New Haven, Three years later found me joining the “great
books” movement which Bob Hlutchins was then launching at
St. John’s College in Annapolis. It took years more to act on the
conclusion that if the great books had been revealed, the great
educational panacea still remained undiscovered, and I took off
for the steppes of the Midwest where I spent a memorable year
as instructor in Psychology at the University of Illinois. Here

[ 358 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

I found a great principle that many of us whose education is
limited to the British tradition badly need to know —a Univer-
sity dedicated to the belief that “any one can come and learn
something.” The following year (1940), I moved to Oberlin
College, “the single island of culture and morality between the
two coasts,” where I remained on the staff for thirteen years,
except for the interruptions of two wars. During World War II
my chair in the Pentagon (Office of the Chief of Staff) cooled
off while I spent a year in Panama and South America. When
the war finally came to an end, we returned to the delights of
the academic way of life — this time for five years. Under threat
of recall as a “critical occupational specialist,” 1 joined the un-
uniformed Pentagon brigade in 1951 to help plan a program of
psychological research for the Army. Included in the blue prints
were an extended trip to Korea and Japan, as well as a job for
myself in the new organization— The George Washington
University Human Resources Research Office, where I am still
on the payroll. The hectic life of 1954 Washington was re-
lieved by a semester at Cornell as visiting Professor of Psychology.
Last year I enjoyed another stretch of teaching as Professorial
Lecturer in Psychology at George Washington University. Over
the years few things have been more rewarding to me than teach-
ing. I cannot forbear a serious reflection at this point on what
Sputnik has made so abundantly clear —the tragic degradation
of the teaching profession in America. A recent trip to Europe —
Germany, Belgium, France and England—has done little to
make me complacent about the world we live in.

We are outdoor lovers and, in 1944, were impelled to buy a
small tract of wild land in the Green Mountains. After a couple
of years of camping out and other reconnaissance, we broke
ground for our cabin in 1946, adding a roof, a kitchen, electricity
and equivalent civilized effects, each year since that time to pre-
pare ourselves for the good life has, however, wiped out the
endowment that might otherwise have made it possible to live
there. For a short while, usually in July, and sometimes in late
November, though, we can be found in Vermont.

Our place in McLean is, for us, the next best thing to the hills
of New England, With a sizeable garden, hens and ducks to

[ 359]

tend, and recently a swimming pool under construction, we lead
a busy hfe.

For most of my life I have been apolitical. The year 1954

brought about a sudden and dramatic realization that I was not

“an island unto myself” — not even politically. To have held the
belicfs of a New Dealer even passively and dimly now meant to a
government worker a fight for his life. If he were a scientist,
especially of the social variety, and with a Harvard Background
it could be very rough indeed. But my political persuasion of
independence remains undiminished — I vote for the best man —
who is invariably a Democrat.

My religion is my own and it sustains me.

And now that I have conquered the repression that has delayed
the writing of this account until A.S.D. (After Sullivan Dead-
line), I find that I experience a relief — even a genriitlichkeit that
prompts me to wish us all an even happier fiftieth.

years of extremely varied work with all types of foods and all
types of organizations has only whetted it. I have worked with
large and small processors and developed many products all the
way from a dehydrated Hollandaise and low calorie dressings
to CANNED BAGELS.

I was drafted in 1941, second number out of the hat. Started as a
private and five years later ended my army life as a major, having
been awarded the Bronze Star. My army career was notable in
that I was chosen to do work for which [d been trained. I was
in charge of the Quartermaster Subsistence Inspection Unit which
set up and controlled production in 255 food plants in Australia,
supplying food for the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific
_area. We packed everything from ham and eggs in a can to
Swiss chard and dehydrated mutton. (But don’t blame me! I
was only following orders.)

After the war I returned to my job as technical director of
Francis H. Leggett & Company and met and married a lady dentist
with a Master’s in Public Health from Yale. The allegiance of
our two children is still undecided.

My consulting work has taken me to Hawaii, Puerto Rico and
South America where I set up the first mayonnaise manufacturing
facilities in Colombia and Venezuela, and the first baby food plant
in Colombia.

What hobby time I have is spent playing the piano, strangely
enough in the style of the ’30’s. I’ve never had time for lessons
or modernizing my style since college days. What spare time
there is I spend dreaming up new products and combinations in
my own laboratory.

The years have sped by, pleasantly and interestingly. I don’t
think I would want to change any of them.

AFTER graduation I had intended to continue in the Graduate

my dear mother in September of that year resulted in a change
of plans. I spent a year in sundry occupations including teaching
in a religious school, but September, 1934, found me enrolled at
the Harvard Law School. After graduation from Law School I
spent the summer with the Legal Aid until my admission to the
Massachusetts Bar in November of 1937. Immediately I began
the practice of law in Boston. With the coming of the war I
entered government service and spent five to six years with the
Treasury Department, Department of Justice and Office of Price
Administration. After the war I resumed my law practice at my

especially interested in immigration and naturalization problems
and represented the first petitioner to be admitted to citizenshi
under the McCarran-Walter Act, although opposed to the bearing
of arms and to non-combatant service.

The greatest change in my life came, of course, in July, 1940,
when I married Selma, who is unusually gifted and talented.
Then when Arthur arrived in 1944 we became the three
musketeers — one for all and all for one. Arthur is at Boston
Latin and thrilled with the awareness of the many illustrious
people who have studied within its walls.

Living within the Boston community, I have managed to keep
abreast of Harvard’s changing scene. I am proud of the fact that
Harvard has maintained its liberal traditions in the face of trying
and difficult situations. Anticipating the Twenty-fifth makes me

to work for the New Haven Railroad at New Haven. The rail-
road went into receivership about six weeks after I arrived (no
connection) and then began a great deal of very interesting work
to do with the reorganization of the road’s finances. The City of
New Haven had a very active Harvard Club largely made up of
Yale men. In the 1938 depression my job was abolished. I spent
that summer traveling abroad and arrived back in time to ex-
perience the hurricane on Cape Cod. That fall I went back to
work for the New Haven Railroad for two years.

In 1940 I met and married Helen Slack Watkins, a graduate
of Smith. This same year I moved to Mystic, Connecticut, and
went to work for the Electric Boat Company, builders of sub-
marines. The first two years I worked in the Production Planning
Department. Then for four years I was head of the Transporta-
tion Department, after which I went back to planning. Mystic
was a very pleasant place to live and in 1948 we built our own
house on the edge of Fishers Island Sound, an ideal place for sail-
ing and swimming. In 1950 we moved to Boston where I began
my affiliation with H. C. Wainwright & Company, investments.
Later in the year, Helen and I were divorced and I moved to
Shelter Island, New York, where I continued in the investment
business.

On Shelter Island I have helped in the restoration and preserva-
tion of an old windmill built by my great-great-great grandfather.
I took the part of one of my ancestors in the Tercentenary cele-
bration of the settling of the Island in 1652. More important to
me, in 1952 I met and married my present wife, Alice, who
brought with her two charming daughters, Susan and Elisabeth.
In 1953 Alice and I did the Grand Tour of Europe.

I have been interested in the Shelter Island Public Library
having been made a trustee in 1951 and its president in 1955. I

am now serving my second term as a trustee of the Shelter Island

An autobiographical note, no matter how true, cannot be much

I am in the midst of adventures on the island of Ithaka. My tennis

as whose wouldn’t be in the limpid sea-water hereabouts. My

Will they in their time see both water and land ablaze? The
arrival of ICBM makes it arguable that they will. It appears that

and Patience has just celebrated her first birthday. With children
so young, it is unmistakably clear to me that, unlike many class-
mates, any thought of retirement is for the very distant future.
And maybe this is good, too, because I have the extreme good
fortune to like and enjoy my work.

Fxcept for the first year out of college, when I was a trainee
with the Singer Sewing Machine Company, my entire business
life has been in advertising. This undoubtedly can be traced back
to a virus contracted at some point during my four years on the
Crimson.

In 1934 I purchased a bankrupt outdoor advertising firm in
Nebraska. After putting this on a reasonably sound operative
basis, I installed a manager in 1936 and took off for the Harvard
Business School. In 1938, after getting my M.B.A., and a summer
in Europe, I took a job with the advertising department of Procter
& Gamble. A year later I joined Pedlar % & Ryan Advertising
Agency in New York.

Then, in 1943, three major events in my life took place. First,
I married a very beautiful young lady, recently graduated from
the University of Cincinnati and at the time a model and teacher
for John Robert Powers in New York. Second, I sold my outdoor
advertising company in Nebraska. And third, I accepted an offer
to join Compton Advertising, Inc., the advertising agency with
which I am currently associated.

My work in recent years has been primarily on the manage-
ment side — contributing to the marketing and advertising policies _
of our clients. This means essentially helping to find the best
markets and developing more effective and efficient selling strate-
gies for existing products as well as new products. In case any of
you see such brands as Gleem toothpaste, Drene shampoo, Ivory
soap, Crisco, Duz, Chase & Sanborn coffee, Remington type-
writers, Mobilgas & Mobiloil — think kindly, my classmates, and
buy, buy, buy!

In addition to business, there have been the usual participations
in civic activities. My major project in recent years has been the
United Hospital Fund of New York, — time-consuming, stimu-
lating and rewarding to the inner soul each year as we near our
annual goal of three million dollars to help offset the yearly
deficits of the eighty-seven member hospitals. Currently, I’m

helping out on the Program For Harvard College and acting as
the New York area vice-chairman for our Twenty-fifth Reunion.
At times I think all we need in this world of ours is more hours
in each day!

Certainly, these have been twenty-five swiftly passing years.
And in spite of depressions, recessions, wars, and now serious
domestic inflation and the worldwide development of nuclear
power that at any minute can be turned destructively against us,
I think most of us can say we have survived for the better and are
on the threshold of possibly the greatest advance of mankind in
world history. This, I believe.

TWENTY-FIVE years later I still take an occasional ribbing
about my Harvard accent; and since, except for two years at the
Business School, I have spent most of my time in New York City,
there must be something of the bulldog in me. As further proof,
I remained for twenty years with Haskins & Sells, one of the
country’s largest public accounting firms. After two years of

[371]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

training, the greater part of the next six years with them was spent
on audits in Central and South America, where my college
Spanish gave me as much accent trouble as my English, but
where the people were most courteous and understanding — at
least until our G.I.’s took over.

In 1938 another Bostonian joined me in exile when I married
Elizabeth Anne Nichols, Massachusetts Art ’36. We spent the
first four years of our marriage saying bon voyage and welcome
home, and moving to different quarters on Long Island each time;
and the next four in moving and accepting congratulations on the
arrival of three bouncing boys and a girl — one for each move.

At this point we decided to stay in one spot, a choice forced
by wartime rent controls, and did so for six years until our small
house was just not large enough to hold all of us. We had never
liked Long Island particularly, so with a five, seven and a ten-
year-old in tow we spent many a long weekend looking for a real
home in Morris County, New Jersey. The choice may have been
from exhaustion, but we were fortunate enough to pick Morris-
town, which is both beautiful and friendly, and real country
besides.

After four years of settling, with our younger two in a
beautiful new school and our eldest about to enter high school,
I was sclected to staff a newly-opened office in Buffalo. Fortu-
nately, right at the same time, I was offered the comptrollership
of Peter ‘A. Frasse & Company, Inc., one of many “steel ware-
houses,” but a specialist in mechanical steel and aluminum prod-
ucts. After twenty years with the same firm, the last ten of which
were in the tax department where the work was interesting but
required an excessive amount of overtime, the prospect of a com-
plcte change was rather unnerving. But confronted with the prob-
lem of adjusting a wife and three school-age children to a new
life in a much colder climate, there was no question; I decided to
go with Frasse.

It has been a choice I have never regretted, even in the first
few months of adapting myself to private rather than public
work. Frasse is much like Morristown, big enough to be interest-
ing and small enough to be personal. Although overtime at Frasse
is ‘nothing compared to the December to June grind in the tax
department of a public accounting firm, it still keeps me busy

enough so that I don’t have too much time for outside activities.
But I am able to devote more time to my family, which has been
a long time coming.

WHEN I decided, midway in my senior year, to enter our Uni-
tarian Theological School in Chicago, I was not at all sure that the
ministry would prove “my dish.” More than one college-mate
took me aside to assure me that with my stammer it was bound
to be a mistake; and I guess only cussedness kept me from agreeing.
During the summer I had other things (I mean another person) to
think about: Becca and I were married August 6, 1933.

Once at Meadville, my inner doubts vanished. With a clear
goal before me, I at last found studies that captured my total
interest. We had many wonderful experiences during the next
three years. To mention one, my student charge in Shelbyville,
Illinois, whither we drove each Friday for a long weekend. The
lay leader of this tiny parish was Winifred Donthit, an extraordi-

[ 373]

nary and unforgettable character, a hunchback scarcely three feet
tall, and the best critic of sermons [ve ever had the good fortune
to meet. My Sunday afternoon course in Homiletics was worth
any three at the school.

Graduating in March, 1936, Becca and I set sail for Europe,
well loaded with letters of introduction to Unitarian leaders in
Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Holland, England and Ire-
land. Traveling by car, we had five jam-packed exciting months.

Agreeing 100% with Horace Greeley’s advice, on our return
to the States in September, we headed for the West Coast. The
assionment, to resuscitate two moribund churches. Sacramento,
after a doleful history of misunderstanding, had ceased operation
three years earlier. Of its supposed membership of ninety-eight,
I could find only a handful still interested — and they were pessi-
mistic of the possibility of reopening. Stockton, forty-five miles
to the south, was in bad shape also, its membership dwindled to
thirty-three. The discouragements and heartbreaks of those de-
pression years in California have long since slipped into the back-
ground of my mind. Only the resiliency of youth saw us through.
We stayed with this dual assignment nine years, the last five of
them looking steadily brighter (in spite of wartime worries and
tensions). When feelers came from one of the strongest of our
middle-western churches, I found myself loth to leave. But I
knew the two churches had grown to the point of needing a
minister apiece, and that meant I’'d worked myself out of a job.

So my apprenticeship came to an end. In the spring of 1945, the

Foote family packed up and trekked to St. Paul. We brought
Fran, aged seven, Nathan, five, and Caleb, eighteen months. The
baby was suffering from some undiagnosed ailment, and the
doctors seemed unable to reverse his malnutrition. Probably only
our move to St. Paul, with its fine Children’s Hospital, saved his
life.

That was twelve years ago. So full have these years been it is
difficult even to summarize. They have seen Fran become a high
school graduate and now a licensed practical nurse, Nathan, a
senior at St. Paul Academy holding more than his share of honors,
including the co-captaincy of Minnesota’s Independent School
League champion football team, and a hopeful applicant to the
old alma mater; and Caleb, a sturdy teenager, a wiry, left halfback

L 374]

on the Second Form team. Not surprisingly, they have seen
Papa and Momma grow a little grey around the temples. They
have seen the church more than double in size, and add a fine
new wing to its parish house They have seen many exciting
chapters in the mental hospital reform in the State, spark-plugged
by an aggressive Unitarian Committee. And they have seen the
manually clumsy parson become a handyman with hammer and
saw. Several childhood chums have been amazed when they have
visited us in “The Dinghy,” our summer cabin on the rock-
ribbed shores at So’west Harbor, Maine, built by your cor-
respondent, and his wonderful wife and kids.

If the foregoing sounds more than a mite pollyannish, my only
defense is that it is written by a happy man, who has found the
struggle to become a mature person challenging, the work of the
ministry rewarding, and the rdle of husband and father both.

IT seems as though those postals from Cambridge reminding me
to write this piece have been arriving daily for the past two
months. So now, this autumn Saturday, having three times arisen
from my chair to take a turn around the room, twice got up for
glasses of water, once misplaced my pencil, once lost track of my
glasses, and twice decided to postpone to next Saturday, here I
am with seventy-three words on the paper, including the words
seventy-three. And it just occurs to me that I am inventing an-
other method of postponement. So here goes.

Mir. Ross once said that the main trouble with the office was
that there were too many pieces of paper in it. Woe to the staff
member, though, who didn’t come across with the piece of paper
he happened to want. Routine in itself had a fascination for Ross.
When I think of him, I often recall two statements he made
repeatedly on the subject: “Too damned many systems around
here!” followed not too long afterward by “We've got to have a
new system!” He was constantly seeking ways to improve the
magazine and to make its operations run more smoothly. Of
course, it was his harrying discontent that led to the standards of
excellence for which the magazine is known.

Working at The New Yorker these many years has been a
stimulating, and often startling, pursuit for this once retiring, if
not indifferent, Harvard man. It has been hard, exacting work.
It has demanded a fair number of my evening and weekend hours
and the greater part of my weekly energy reserves. But I
wouldn't trade the job. I can’t really imagine working anywhere
else. The New Yorker stands editorially for most of the things I
believe in, and I can’t think of many organizations nowadays that
do. Moreover, no job could offer higher reward than the privi-
lege of working with, and becoming a friend of, ‘great editors
like Harold Ross and William Shawn.

My best wishes to you all, until our next meeting in 1983 — on
the space platform.

OFFICES HELD: Director, Music Publishers Association of the United States.

MEMBER OF: American Bandmasters Association, since 1954.

PROBABLY the only facet of my life which would be of interest
to my classmates is in connection with my business career — the
publishing of music of all types (symphonies — band, orchestra
and choral music for schools and colleges— Broadway show
scores — Hit Parade popular songs, down to but not including
“Rock and Roll”) which has brought me into daily contact with
outstanding personalities of the musical world (symphony con-
ductors such as Ormandy and; Fiedler — serious composers such
as Copland and Gould — Broadway show writers such as Lerner
and Loewe — popular recording artists such as Les Paul and
Mary Ford). I think we can agree that music publishing has more
glamour than the manufacturing of nuts and bolts. This business
is really a number of vocations compressed into one. After spend-
ing all of my years since graduation, except for a brief period
during the War, in the field of music publishing, I have at least
acquired a good working knowledge of a few highly specialized
subjects, including copyright law, performing rights societies,
ie. ASCAP, (American Society of Composers, Authors and Pub-
lishers) and BMI (Broadcast Music Inc.), sampling and logging
techniques, music synchronization problems, the correlation of
music in the school curriculum and the integration of music in the
theatre.

As to my home life, four children ranging in age from three to
seventeen keep my wife and me occupied, although I did have the
foresight to provide our own “built-in” baby sitter. Any offers,
men?

FOLLOWING graduation I spent one last summer skippering a
boat in Cape Cod waters before settling down to serious business.
In the fall I was engulfed by the Chase National Bank of New
York, who tried their best to see if my conformation would
yield to the mold of an embryonic banker. But in the fall of 1934
a courtship of long standing culminated in my marriage to Eliza-
beth Wells. Her family controlled the American Optical Com-
pany in Southbridge, Massachusetts. Next thing I knew, it was
1936, and I was in the optical manufacturing business. We spent
four wonderful years there and started to build our family, while
I tried to learn the financial end of a manufacturing business.
When the war started the Optical Company shipped us to their
optical instrument manufacturing subsidiary, Spencer Lens Com-
pany, in Buffalo, New York. We moved to the city for the dura-
tion, where I did my best until the war ended to deliver periscopes
and anti-aircraft telescopes to the Navy. Then came a return to
company headquarters in Southbridge. We lived there until 1951,

[ 380 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

when the family sold its interest in American Optical and we
moved to the vicinity of New York. There the partnership of Fox,
Wells & Company, more recently Fox, Wells & Rogers, was born.

This is politely described as a private investment firm. A less
polite friend has referred to it as crap shooting. The object is to
take a certain portion of a family estate and invest it in small
enterprises having unusual growth prospects. Of course, this
always means unusual risk prospects, too. Anyway, seven years
have lapsed and the firm is still solvent. Its primary business
interest — oil exploration and production and television broad-
casting. Risky? Yes, but small businesses are fun and maybe they
should be better supported by private venture capital lest the free
enterprise system get any less free.

Our home life has been centered the past seven years in New
Canaan, Connecticut. Two of the three kids have graduated from
the New Canaan Country School, the youngest is still there. The
oldest, Betsy, also graduated from Westover School and was
admitted to Smith College in the fall of 1957. The lad in the
middle, Harry, was admitted to St. George’s School in the fall of
1957. The youngest, Ginny, hopes to follow in her sister’s foot-
steps after she, gets through the New Canaan Country School.
Life as a family has brought us the greatest joy at home, traveling
together from time to time, taking annual cruises in Cape Cod
waters and singing, occasionally five strong, in the church choir.
We may not always carry the tune, but we’re loud.

Outside of home and business life, I have not been particularly
active in civic or political affairs, but have been active in the affairs
of the Episcopal churches in the communities in which we have
lived. I have also been active in various country clubs because
of my interest in the disease known as golf, which, together with
sailing in the summer, have constituted my chief forms of athletic
recreation. It has also been a source of great pleasure to be as-
sociated actively in the affairs of the Harvard Club of New
Canaan and to have been a member of the Harvard Clubs of New
York and Boston.

In summary, life has been full since graduation, involving for
the most part home, business, church, recreational and social
activities. The combination, coupled with the passage of time,
has yielded a full measure of grey hair and wrinkles, along with a

pusBLications: A few articles and short stories in magazines ranging in
calibre from House Organs to the Saturday Evening Post.

TO be woefully trite, it wasn’t easy to get a job in the fall of
1933, particularly in advertising or sales promotion, where I
wanted to be.

Finally, in October, after somehow obtaining interviews with
a whale of a lot of Philadelphia businessmen, I was accepted by
the Sun Oil Company (almost totally through my father’s friend-
ship with the president).

But it wasn’t until April of 1934, that they actually put me to
work and then, at frightful hours, in a gasoline station — “to
get the feel of selling” as they put it. My degree in English was
a big help; there’s nothing like a thorough knowledge of Chaucer
to help you scrub and polish and cut grass and scrub and polish.
Came winter; times were worse, and I was “temporarily” laid
off. That’s when I started writing articles and short stories (with
small success), and also looking around for another job. I finally
got one in April, 1935, at N. W. Ayer & Son, at $16.00 a week,
which was less than I'd been making in the gas station. But I
loved it. (I loved it even more when, a couple of weeks later,
Sun Oil said I could come back to work for them. I didn’t.)

Having majored in English at Harvard College, one would

[ 383 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

think that writing advertising copy for Goodyear tires, Kohler
plumbing, Bass ski boots, Atlantic gasoline, etc., wouldn’t be too
horrendous. At first, however, pieces of advertising copy which
I considered gems of English prose were blue-penciled to what I
considered oblivion by my superiors. “Like cutting a few pearls
out of a matched necklace, isn’t it?” my boss said one day. “Now
get this straight and never forget it. The client isn’t a bit in-
terested in what you learned at Harvard. But, he definitely is
interested in telling people, as quickly as possible and as con-
vincingly as possible, why his product is a hell of a lot better
than what his competitors have to offer, and that the potential
buyer cannot live without having one.”

Why, you may well ask, did I in 1942 leave one of the country’s
finest and largest advertising agencies for the Advertising Depart-
ment of a small, virtually unheard of manufacturer of pharma-
ceuticals? A manufacturer of drugs and combinations of drugs
about which I knew nothing and which were, and still are, adver-
tised solely to the medical profession? Why did I leave Ayer
where, I am immodest enough to believe, I had many close friends,
and join Smith, Kline & French Laboratories where I knew only
one man, and him but very slightly?

The answer is not new: my family. While not large, it was
large enough to make more money mandatory. I have never re-
gretted the change. My new firm was, and still is, as sound as they
come. In 1942, we manufactured and promoted less than ten
products; today more than 70—not including various dosage
forms. In 1942, the Advertising Department consisted of seven
persons, today more than sixty. Most other departments have
expanded correspondingly, or more so. Countless departments
and activities exist now which weren’t ever dreamed of in 1942.
We have five subsidiary companies, two of which both manu-
facture and sell our products around the world. In 1946, my wife,
Suzanne, bought $750.00 worth of S.K.F. stock. Today it 1s
worth $12,000, Maybe enough to send my elder son, Rich,
through Harvard (God and the Dean of Admissions willing).

John, our second, doesn’t know where he wants to go. At the
moment he likes Princeton. Unfortunately, Suzanne agrees with

hin, apparently, she thinks it is not too smart to have two brothers
in the same college at the same time. Perhaps she’s thinking of the

fortunately, our boys aren’t quite so good; at least not yet.)

I met Suzanne in 1933, but for depression reasons we couldn’t
be married until 1937. If possible, she’s a finer woman, and more
attractive today, than she was then. The boys, I’ve touched on.
They’re not at all bad at football, baseball, swimming, tennis and
squash. They pick fine friends, and when it comes to the ladies,
they’re whizzes. In recent years, they have found work in the
summer months. To sum up, I have an infinitely finer family than
I deserve. I’m proud of each of them.

Hobbies? Bridge, stamps, chess, sniff (almost everyone except
Philadelphians calls it “dominoes”), reading, loafing and not nearly
as much golf as I would like.

Vacations? For the past seven years we’ve vacationed on the
ocean in Nova Scotia, largely at a lovely spot called White Point
Beach. I hope we can keep it up. (Incidentally, we wouldn't be
a bit upset if they would restore the Boston-Yarmouth boat.)

Politics? I’m afraid I’m an in-the-rut, rock-ribbed Republican.
Nationally, because I believe the Democrats are fundamentally
opposed to just rewards for successful free enterprise. Locally,
because in our township and county, it would be a wasted vote to
back a Democrat for public office.

All of the foregoing doesn’t add up to very much, but I’m busy
and I’m happy.

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

AFTER I had read the “Sample Lives” sent by the committee, ]
decided the best thing I could do would be to send nothing but
statistics and plead Jack of time because of a trip to the moon or
someplace. At first, it seemed to me the “Sample Lives” were
turned out by literary “pros” who were fascinated with their
subjects. But the committee has gotten across the point that
while I might not care to write about myself, I would want to
read about others; and, if we all failed to write, there would be
nothing —etc. All right, all right; I give up! Here it is!

In the first place, the faculty found me such an interesting
subject, they kept me at Cambridge after most of you had gone,
and I used to write “OCC” after my name. But I fooled them.
Although I didn’t seem to learn any more (that part didn’t fool
them), I enjoyed the year; and as a member of John Dean’s
team, I shared the pleasure of beating Yale.

Although a Southerner whose Grandfather refused for the rest
of his life to go “Nawth” after the War of Northern Aggression,
I also love New England and wanted to live there. My Mother
came from Maine, and we had summered there since my child-
hood. I was lucky enough to get a job in Boston with Armour
& Company and that made it possible to marry a New York girl
with ancestral roots in New England. __

But the law was in the back of my mind, and we left Boston in
1936 and went to New York City where I attended Fordham
Law School while clerking in a New York law office. However,
the practice of law was not what I wanted. I found my desire in
1940 and in February, 1941, I was accepted by the F.B.I.

We have been stationed in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Lancaster,
Pennsylvania, New York City and, now, Washington. We live in
my native Virginia, where Marj. wins golf prizes and I try to
explain that if I had taken up the game earlier in life I might have
been better. For many years we have talked about where we
would live permanently one day. We started in Maine, but as the
years have passed the winters have seemed colder and we have
now reached Connecticut mentally; that may be it.

All in all, it’s been pretty good fun, Now for the next twenty-
five. Cheers!

A HEAD of red curls atop forty-three inches of whirling dyna-
mite just brushed by to offer a good-night kiss. That was Penny,
the youngest of our three girls and a new addition to our family
since the Fifteenth Anniversary Report. From the general con-
fusion, the other two— Mary-Lee and Martha-Jane — together
with a visiting cousin, are preparing for bed. And all this, plus
the Hi-Fi blasting away in another room, is hardly conducive to
father’s meeting this biographical deadline. T'wenty-five years
ago this deadline was a glorious potential. Now it is a realization
and time, perhaps, for a little evaluation of past efforts and ac-
complishments.

This last summer, I received my fifteen-year service award
from my employer, W. H. Nichols Company — included therein
twenty-five months World War II duty with the Navy. These
have been years of interesting and absorbing work. Do you know
that your wife’s nylons were made from yarn spun with a Nichols-
manufactured spinning pump? From man-made fibre spinning
pumps to modern aircraft oil pumps and milling machines, Nichols
goes around the world. |

Turning to more extra-curricular activities, my attention is
divided among many things — photography, gardening, skating,
skiing, swimming and music. Of the active sports, I participate
(with the children) to the extent these old bones will allow. My
wife enjoys some of these, too, and joins in such activities as
Girl Scouts and other female pursuits. Among more philosophical
occupations, my wife and I try to impart to our children some
of the “libertarian” concepts of our American Heritage.

and have been here relatively ever since. For several years, was
with an advertising publishers’ representative. “Then I wrote a
book, Afy Yankee Mother, which was published by Vanguard
Press in 1942, shortly after I had gone into military service. In
the Army, I wrote for a camp newspaper, and also did a great
quantity of feature articles for magazines on Quartermaster Corps
activities. Later, in Europe, was with army historical service in
various places, but stationed in and around Paris for about a year,
where I wrote a second book, My Yankee Paris, published by
Vanguard in 1945.

Upon returning to this country, I worked first on the staff of
Esquire Magazine, then on a number of public relations jobs, and
then had a long, delightful stint on the editorial staff of Holiday
Magazine. In 1956, I left Holiday to return to the advertising
field with a publishers’ representative, where I am now. I was
married in 1949, and now have a four-year-old son.

It seems incredible that I am already into my mid-forties, a
feeling that I am sure each man setting down his class life must
share. Companioning with a four-year-old and thus thinking
part of the time like a four-year-old is a pleasant variant.

I find that scientifically I have no religious convictions, but
that socially I do. Politically, I have tried to remain independent.
For example, in the last two elections I voted for Eisenhower and
Stevenson, in that order. And always find it surprising that my
friends despise me either for the one vote or the other, since
tolerance is not a major political virtue amongst us.

Though I prefer life in the city, and since 1933 have lived
chiefly in apartments, I do find the citification and urbanization
of the countryside that is taking place on all sides appalling. When
I was a boy on an isolated farm in northern Massachusetts, Boston
was as far away as the distant moon. Today there’s an exurb
spread over my father’s farm, and it is one of the outer reaches
of Bostontown. And the air authorities say that no two people
anywhere on earth are more than two days apart! Hello, neighbor,
indeed!

TO give pause for a twenty-five year report brings the realization
that the midpoint in one’s life and career is at hand and most
probably passed by. There has been little outward change these
past few years. We have been in our present home eight years;
the children are growing, and for the elder, college is not too far
away.

Tam still with the Harvard Trust Company, specializing in bank
operations. My own duties are concerned with personnel, training
of new employees and correspondence. It is apparent that the
banking profession, as well as many others, is on the threshold of
major operational changes due to developments in the field of
electronics and automation. Complete automation is not with us
as yet, but enough information is available so that the outline is
much more clearly discernible. All this means that checking
account numbering and more electronic automatic machinery,
with a corresponding reduction in personnel for the clerical and
accounting function, is on the way. The intense pressure to ob-
tain competent clerks will be considerably alleviated, and perhaps
it will not be too much to hope that we might be able to keep our
customers’ checking accounts posted correctly for a change.

Aside from business affairs, my wife, Anne, and I are interested
in art, music and religious education. Anne paints with oils and
teaches her regular Sunday School class. I collect classical Hi-Fi

AFTER college, for me it was Tufts Medical School, a two-year
internship in New York City and then my big decision. What
type of medicine did I want to practise? Since I felt that the
whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and since I preferred the
whole individual to any specialized limitation, I decided to do |
general practice. I finally settled in what was then a rural com-
munity of five thousand people outside Hartford and had just
got my roots down when I came up with an early lucky number
in selective service. So in February, 1941, I went in the Army as
an Infantry Battalion surgeon for a year’s service; but the Japs
upset that for me as for the rest of us. I spent one year on a coral
reef few then or since have known. The rest of the war I sweated
out in Hawaii, taking my turn at about all the medical jobs there
are. Then came the welcome “ruptured duck,” home, marriage
and a return to practice.

By this time our sociologic revolution had changed my rural
town into a suburban one. I now am practising in a fifteen

it. The “big fish in a small pond” has many advantages and I

nice home, peace of mind and a wife who makes my life complete
and happy. I have a lot of fun dabbling in local organizations, |
am school physician, and aside from a tape recorder, have no time
for hobbies or travel. I am afraid that I shall never have my por-
trait hung in University Hall; but I have a lot of deep satisfaction
out of daily living and hope that my son will see fit to follow in
the old man’s footsteps.

IN some ways 1933 was probably as good a year as any for those
of us who had neither a graduate degree nor experience, to start
trying to earn a living. At least we didn’t expect much. In my
case there was the added lack of incentive that I hadn’t the
slightest idea what I wanted to do. My total earnings for the
first year after graduation were fifty dollars from peddling invest-
ment trust shares in Boston.

Offered $700.00 a year to teach a group of fourth grade boys
at a new private school outside of Philadelphia, I leaped at it. I
enjoyed it immensely and the following year moved to a small
school in Deerfield, Massachusetts, which for the next eight years
provided a combination of satisfactions which I still consider to
be unexcelled. It was one of those rare experiences of being
associated with a group of thoroughly delightful people who were

[ 393 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

also inspired teachers. All this amid the beauty of the Connecticut
Valley and the Berkshire Hills.

After Pearl Harbor I tried to get into the service but the doctors
proved incorruptible regarding my game leg, so in 1943 I took
a job in the War Production ‘Board “where I remained until the
end of the war observing that well-nigh incredible phenomenon
— Washington in wartime.

In 1945 I was married. That sentence is wholly inadequate by
itself, but it would require a separate volume to describe the full
impact of the event.

By the end of the war I had acquired a deep interest in the
relationship of the Federal Government to the American people.
The area in which this relationship seemed to me to be the least
satisfactory was that of foreign affairs, so I entered the State
Department and we settled down happily in Washington.

For the next nine years I was absorbed in the problems of try-
ing to develop an understanding among the American people
of what international relations are and of what the United
States can and cannot do about them. Considering that they had
what a friend of mine calls “a hundred and seventy-five-year
holiday from history,” 1 think the American people’s abandon-
ment of isolationism in the short span from 1940 to 1950 is both
miraculous and magnificent. I like to think that despite the
brief advent of McCarthyism, the efforts of those of us in the
State Department concerned with public information contributed
to a clearer understanding of America’s role in world affairs.

In the course of this work I quite naturally became increasing-
lv interested in the substance of foreign relations and in the work
of the career F oreign Service. In 1955 I was assigned for a year
to the National War College in Washington, an institution
created, in its present form, by several far-sighted men who
realized after the war that the country’s future might well de-
pend on cooperation between the military and civilian branches
of the government and that this could best be fostered by close
association and mutual understanding between leaders of both
groups. Ir was a rewarding experience.

I was sworn in as a foreign service officer in 1956 and as-
siyned to the Bureau of European Affairs of the State Depart-
ment where I am currently learning some of the requirements

[ 394]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

of diplomacy and awaiting assignment abroad. Not the least in-
teresting and educational aspect of these years has been the
opportunity for extensive travel for the State Department both
in the United States and in Europe.

After several years’ residence in Washington I became un-
happily aware that, like many others here, I had been disfran-
chised. Several of us formed the Washington Home Rule Com-
mittee and have been working for ten years, with no visible result
yet, for an elected city government and the right to vote in
national elections. It is uphill work and my respect for those
who labored for women’s suffrage is unlimited. A rewarding
by-product of the home rule fight has been my involvement in
other civic activities chiefly through the medium of member-
ship in a local citizens’ association which with some sixty other
similar groups plays a considerable réle in the affairs of this vote-
less city.

Having done a good deal of sailing in everything from eight
to eighty feet during college and for several years afterward,
I miss having had little opportunity for it in recent years. I read
a good bit, play chess and “do-it-myself,” mostly in the line of
simple furniture. I’m debating what my third foreign car shall be
but my tastes are such that like J.P. Morgan on yachts, I feel
that “if you have the slightest doubt whether you can afford
one — you can’t.” When my wife’s writing interferes with her
superb cooking, the latter is turned over to me to do on a char-
coal grill on the terrace.

As the immortal Satch Paige is reputed to have said, “Never
look back; something might be gaining on you.”

more about making boating a safer pleasure and hope to be able
to pass some of this along to others.

MY undergraduate career at Harvard ended one frosty February
day in my junior year. The Dean’s Office just couldn’t take it any
longer. A lucky break came when Trinity College decided that
they would try and salvage the scholastic wreck. They suc-
ceeded. A second lucky break came with the good news that
Harvard Medical School would accept me. Following gradua-
tion from the Medical School there followed an internship at
the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital until March, 1939. A residency
position at the New York Hospital concluded my formal medi-
cal training on New Year’s Eve, December 31, 1939.

Private practice of internal medicine began in association with
my father at the Faulkner Hospital in Boston. This continued
until January, 1942. There being plenty of spare time during those
first few months of practice, there was ample opportunity to woo
and win my favorite wife. We were married in August, 1940.

January, 1942, found me in uniform trying to look and act like a
“Gentleman” with the rank of captain in the Medical Corps. Feb-
ruary, 1946, still found me trying to look and act the part with
the same bars on my shoulders. Uncle Sam finally got so fed up
with my griping that he let me go. Nearly three years were
spent in Australia on a tour at the taxpayers’ expense.

In April, 1946, we moved to South Dartmouth where we now
live. Once again I started private practice with my first office
in New Bedford. This continued for ten years. During that time
our family grew, practice grew and I seemed to get involved in
more and more outside activities all of which I enjoyed. Recrea-

tional activities revolved around cruising, tennis and a bit of
squash, A moderate interest in town activities resulted in getting
clected a Town Meeting Representative and a few other posi-
tions. An excellent private school (Friends Academy) took up
more “free” time. .a%

In August, Lotte I became interested in the position of Di-
rector of Medical Education at St. Luke’s Hospital here in New
Bedford and was appointed to that position which was newly
established. This meant giving up private practice. As a result,
[ can now answer the telephone in a pleasant voice and thorough-
ly enjoy both the work and the added time for relaxation. Ac-
tually though, there seems to be more to do than before. Sailing
continues to be my chief hobby with a smattering of tennis
and squash and skiing in the winter.

ON graduation I joined the Boston Herald-Traveler as a cub re-

porter to begin a very pleasant and interesting association that

lasted nearly ten years and covered a varicty of editorial as-

signments. During the academic year, 1938-39, I was fortunate

ta be selected as a Nieman Fellow in Journalism and returned to

the University for an unusually stimulating and rewarding ex-

perience.
Shortly before Pearl Harbor I helped in the establishment of

[ 398 }

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

the Red Cross Blood Donor Center in Boston and served as its
first director, while still continuing my newspaper work. Later
I served as director of public information for the Red Cross.
Early in 1944, I was commissioned in the U.S. ‘Marine Corps
Reserve and spent two years on active duty as an air combat in-
telligence officer. I visited a fair number of islands over most
of the Pacific but the only combat was at Okinawa. I went on
very inactive duty at the end of the war but have recently joined
a Marine Corps Reserve Volunteer Training Unit in New York
which advises and helps on problems of public relations and re-
cruiting in this area.

I failed rather dismally to recruit our son, Jay, for either Har-
vard or the Marines. He was graduated from Brown with the
Class of 1955, was commissioned an ensign in the Navy the same
day and the following day took a bride. This made us a Brown-
Pembroke, as well as a Harvard-Radcliffe family. He is seeing a
good part of the world from the deck of a destroyer, and will
see more of his home when he goes on inactive duty in June. He
tells us we are to become grandparents in March.

At the end of the war I joined the Bell Telephone Laboratories
in New York as information manager, meaning public relations,
and several years ago became assistant director of publications.
This, too, is a most stimulating and pleasant association.

For me it has been a very satisfying, interesting and I hope not
entirely ineffective twenty-five years. I have been exceptionally
fortunate in those priceless ingredients of a man’s life, his family
and his work. My other interests, aside from the usual, have
centered largely around hunting and fishing, with their con-
comitant of raising English setters (on a small scale) and shoot-
ing skeet. We have done some traveling and are planning more.
Need I add we are looking forward to the years ahead with
relish and, even in these critical times, with confidence?

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

A short tour with the Veterans Administration while getting re-
located in California at the end of the war was followed by a
settling down in my present job as a mathematics teacher at the
local institution of the extensive California junior college system.

Living for all the family is made enjoyable by a location in
the country plus proximity to the Monterey Peninsula, the
mountain areas of the Sierra during summer vacations, and a
short drive, California-wise, to the attractions of San Francisco.
Contact with New England and the pleasant associations of un-
dergraduate years has been limited to one visit in the last fifteen
years. It is hoped that this deficiency will not be a permanent
one and that the unique appeal of New England and Harvard
may be enjoyed again.

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

NINETEEN THIRTY-THREE seems not to long ago, and
there are evidently not too many twenty-five-year re-enlistments
ahead. Presumably the pattern ‘of personal life has been pretty
well set. In my case, it turns out to be an unplanned rotation of
college teaching, research and writing, and administration of
research grants. The notion of teaching, ironically, originated
in the high pay compared with business, this in the forgotten
days of the Depression. Now the median first-year graduate
of the Business School does as well as the median full professor.
So harsh necessity, or a surfeit of charitable professing, spurs the
academic into the so-called real world periodically. Then, too,
it is easy to run out of things to say if you teach too much.

In a very productive economy, with multiplying population,
there is more and more to be said for leisure, privacy and a sus-
tained enjoyment of natural beauty. Probably this is an evidence
of the late sensate, overripe character of the culture, the soggy
late empire, or at least the frontier scarcity temporarily in abey-
ance. But it takes the first enlistment to learn how to live with
your culture at all sensibly. We find ourselves spending more of
the year, and more frequently all of the year, on the Maine
coast, which is conveniently near the Baltimore-to-Boston metro-
politan complex, but still has a reputation for nasty weather in
winter, and so remains relatively uncrowded and absolutely beau-
tiful. In the brief weeks of summer, we can take the boat off-
shore where the crowd thins out fast.

AFTER graduation, I spent five years with the same brokerage
house in Baltimore which had employed me for two years before
college. A large mutual savings bank tolerated me for the next
three. In toto, it was a period of “aimless mewing” which term-
inated abruptly in February, 1941, when our National Guard
artillery regiment was called into active service.

By October, 1942, after marching up and down the east coast
from Massachusetts to Florida, the 29th Infantry Division and I
were overseas guarding our English cousins and preparing for
D-Day. August, 1945, found me back in the United States with
no wounds, some decorations and an enemy artillery battery to
my credit. My able administration of a bordelle in France un-
doubtedly contributed to my terminal lieutenant-colonelcy.

The transition to civilian life was gentle. My fiancée of thirty-
four months and I consummated our vows here in Jacksonville,
and spent my accumulated leave visiting relatives and job-hunting.
We settled in Baltimore, and I began to learn about manufacturing
and sales with a division of Bendix Aviation. An unsuccessful at-
tempt to launch a small company followed. But, in 1950, a break
came and we moved to Florida, where we have been since.

Thanks to my mother-in-law (Vassar ’06), I visited the Psycho-
logical Laboratory at Stevens Institute in 1954, and re-oriented my
vocational objectives. Personnel work has been my means of
livelihood from that time. I was admitted to the Graduate School
of the University of Florida, in 1955, and now have twelve hours
of credit toward a Master’s degree in the field of guidance and
psychology. By the time I’m fifty, I hope to be ready to push on
toward my doctorate.

Life these days is full and rich. I am very active in civic affairs,
and am an officer, Sunday-school teacher and choir director for
my church, I have a keen interest in the local Harvard Club and
a longing to send my three sons to a university where truth is the

[ 403 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

abiding goal. Politically, I’m a Democrat, except for national elec-
tions.

Some vignettes which appear out of the twenty-five years of
memory are: the Tercentenary in ’36; a quiet hour in the Yard in
March of ’42; Omaha Beach on D-Day; the “Bulge” on December
16, 19445 Our wedding; reunion with former roommate, Lew
Filstrup, ’33; holding my first child; Harry Truman’s re-election;
the pan-handle of Texas from the air at night; singing “Dixie” at
the rally for Ike; Ponte Vedra Beach on a moonlight night.

My story would be incomplete if I failed to emphasize the im-
portance of my Vassar, "41, partner, whose staunch support and
understanding have undergirded every. move of the last twelve
years. As the world measures it, we are not wealthy; but we are
gradually attaining the peace of mind which passeth all under-
standing.

IN recent years I have been taking night courses conducted b
the State. To my surprise, this extended studying led me back
once more to the hallowed lecture rooms of familiar Harvard
Hall at the edge of the Yard. Fortunately, the results have
directed me to an interesting and pleasant position with the
School Building Department, City of Boston, Then, lawyer
friends, having heard I was applying myself again to books, in-
vited me into their well-established firm where I have been
learning something about law. My schedule is a rather busy one
so that I have limited time for travel and the further develop-
ment of my one hobby which years back was music. The latter
has been supplanted by an association, and a somewhat con-
scientious one, with subjects sociological in scope. They certainly
are duller than music, but, being the trend today, they seem to
offer more workable solutions than my solitary hobby.

For fun, relaxation and vacations I visit various relatives who
have summer homes on the shores of Cape Cod or the North
Shore where boating is the principal sport and one I enjoy very
much.

Although I stay close to Boston, I still find myself frequently
meeting classmates whose friendships need mending and renew-
ing on my part, yet they are very enjoyable and worthwhile.

Twenty-fifth-year Class showed more wear and tear than any
of the others. Now, after attending several of our pre-Reunion

members of the Class of °33. How young and well-preserved

[ 406 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

The years since our last Report have been fruitful, interesting
and happy ones, in the main. My charming and very intelli-
gent wife has made productive use of her time and now is presi-
dent of the local League of Women Voters. This activity
furnishes just enough diversion from her household responsibilities
to make her a happy, well-balanced mother. My daughter Linda
is now a tall and pretty young lady, who brings pleasure to her
parents through an engaging personality, excellence in her studies
and general interest in extra-curricular activities. Gabriel, now
eleven years, shows a deep interest in science, and may some day
help to close the gap between the scientific advances of the
U.S.S.R. and the United States. Ellen, who possesses a most
pleasant attitude toward life, is a ray of sunshine at all times and
holds her own in scholastic attainments to maintain the level
set by her older sister and brother. These are the principal

characters to whom I owe thanks for a happy existence.

Professionally, I have had the opportunity to represent a group
which incorporated the City Bank & Trust Company in Boston
— the only commercial bank chartered in Boston since 1933. This
is the type of experience that one is usually privileged to enjoy
but once in a lifetime and the satisfaction derived therefrom
is indeed rare. Needless to say, the responsibilities and demands
on my time have increased proportionately.

Politically, I vote independently, but my inclinations are
strongly Democratic, and I was quite unhappy that Adlai Steven-
son did not get the chance to show his capabilities. In 1954
I ventured into the local contest for School Committee, made an
excellent showing, but failed to make it. It was a most worth-
while experience. I feel strongly that more of us should exert
whatever influence we have to make our schools better and to
see that adequate funds are appropriated for that purpose.

What little time there is left is used by my wife and me to
take part in a fine Great Books discussion group which is now
in its fifth year. We find it stimulating, thoroughly enjoyable
and, incidentally, educational, My daily experience with new
people and new situations constantly excites my interest and I
hope to be equally enthusiastic about the practice of law on
the occasion of our Fiftieth.

DEAN HANFORD unwittingly gave me a start towards one of
my main life interests when he approved my working for a con-
struction company in Boston. Since that momentous day I have
been dealing with varied phases of construction for many years,
spending two years in Washington, one year in Detroit, and al-
most a ten-year stint with the Federal Housing Administration
working up to senior architectural inspector and chief of the
Complaint Division.

- I organized a corporation and built a large shopping center in
the Washington area known as the Langley Park, Maryland,
Shopping Center, which is highly successful, having a large de-
partment store and twelve other stores. This was a tough job and
took some four years of concentrated work tackling architects,
builders, leases, utility companies and a multiplicity of detail. I
also remodeled the home where we live in Georgetown, Wash-
ington. In 1945 I worked as a special assistant in the State Depart-
ment, helping to organize the United Nations in San Francisco.
Turning to politics, I worked for the Taft team both in 1948 and
1952.

"We have a daughter who made her debut last year, one son in
St. Paul’s School, a fifth former, and another at St. Albans; both,
I hope, will attend Harvard. For some twenty-five years we have

[ 408 ]

spent our summers at York Harbor, Maine, where we have a
house which we remodeled.. There I do a great deal of sailing
(z10 International Class) and golfing (middle eighties). Winters
we head for Nassau where we find Paradise Beach all the name
implies.

For fourteen years, as a trustee I have helped to guide the
destiny of the McCormick estate, which takes me to Chicago
frequently. I also handle several stock and bond portfolios for
estates.

Company. During this time, I acquired sons two and three. In
the winter of 1950, when the duPont Company went back into
the atomic energy business, the Gilbert family again went on the
move. I first went to General Electric’s Knolls Atomic Power
Laboratory in Schenectady, New York, where I served as liaison
manager for a duPont group, pending building of duPont-operated
facilities at Savannah River Ordnance, Aiken, South Carolina. We
moved to Aiken two years later. In the summer of 1953, I left
the duPont Company and returned to my home in Phoenix, I am
presently occupied with Pratt-Gilbert Hardware Company, a

wholesale firm handling industrial and mining supplies, which was
co-founded by my father fifty-eight years ago. It was difficult
to leave the duPont Company and my many fine friends there
after eighteen years.

During the last twelve years with the company, we moved nine
times and had an opportunity to learn first-hand nearly every
section of the country. But now that the boys are growing up,
it is good to be back in Phoenix and watch them putting down
roots in the old home town. Like most other fathers of boys, I
have made almost a second career of Scouting and Little League
baseball. I’m putting in a fifth year on the local Cub Scout Com-
mittee and, in addition, spend Saturday mornings with the Boy
Scouts. With three sons playing Little League and Pony League
ball, I have inevitably put in several years as sponsor and umpire.
Horses have recently replaced golf as my number one hobby.
Where else but in Phoenix can you saddle your horse and sally
out to the drug store for a cigar without being considered com-
pletely daft? I had the pleasure of renewing my acquaintance
with Harvard when, in January, 1957, I spent three weeks at the
Graduate School of Business Administration, dipping into a
“Management Course for Industrial Distributors.” I found the
weather hadn’t warmed up any in twenty-five years.

Doris and I were married as soon as I had my first regular job,
with the technical department of Lever Bros. in Cambridge. The
next five years were spent in moving once a year while con-
tributing nobly to the support of a succession of local general
practitioners and assorted specialists. In 1941 we bought our
first home in Arlington, Massachusetts, caught our breaths and
took our first look at local affairs. Doris, a trained alto, persuaded
me I had enough voice for the church choir and to my amaze-
ment I did have. Together with standard grounds improvement
and joining the Masons, this kept me busy a while.

In 1946, for reasons of health, we again moved, to a two-acre
home in Southboro, which gave us a much wider field for garden-
ing of all kinds, and the greater interest in local affairs necessary
in a small community. I decided to try my hand at politics, served
my apprenticeship with the P.T.A. and ran unopposed for School
Committee. About this time we became convinced of the strength
and solidity of the Episcopal Church, joined St. Mark’s, and were

confirmed together. Here I had the unique distinction of being

[411]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

the only male member of the choir for two years — my sporting
blood being stirred by the acrobatics necessary to stretch a small-
range baritone over the essential passages in tenor and bass parts.
The pastoral interlude was interrupted by the famous Luck-
man fiasco, the whole technical department was transferred to
New Jersey and the stubborn Scotch-Irish in me rebelled. Hence
my present position, my own choice of location and reward.
Lately, our outside interests are confined to those of our one
hopeful, called John to minimize the dynastic confusion. Now a
senior in high school, he amazes us with his wide range of in-
terests and adult approach to life. We have no fears for his future.
Hobbies — color photography, sports (John and I are loyal
rooters for all Boston area teams, both professional and amateur),
music, gardening, TV adult westerns, literature and history (I de-
tested both at school).
Political affiliations — Doris was born in Vermont — Nuff ced.
I spent thirty-one years in and around Boston, mostly in smaller
Republican communities. Actually, we are Independents and
we were Eisenhower Republicans before there was such a thing.

papers on diabetes and pregnancy.

FOUR years of medical school, five years of hospital training and
almost four years of military service (Army Medical Corps,
overseas service in Southwest Pacific Area, captain to lieutenant

some teaching and a tiny bit of research have taken care of the
second half of these twenty-five years.

I HAVE now on innumerable occasions applied myself to the task
of writing a brilliant, witty and detailed account of my life since
1933. Still completely barren of inspiration, I find myself the
recipient of notices, requests and warnings that this great work
must promptly be completed and in the expectation that I shall
next receive threats I now address myself to the task in a grimly
determined mood.

If I have learned anything in twenty-five years it is that time
is truly relative. As a callow youth in 1933, I was firmly con-
vinced that twenty-five years was a long, long time. Now I know
that it is only a brief space, a matter of weeks, between graduation
and reunion. In our chance meetings, I have noticed, it is true,
that time has had some impact on fellow classmates but miraculous-
ly I have remained unchanged. In some mysterious fashion I

[413 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

have, without growing older, acquired a wife and two sons. As ]
write this, they have from time to time read and the noise you
hear in the background is their derisive laughter.

The factual details of the last twenty-five years are not difficult
to record. After graduation from the College, I spent a year at the
Graduate School of Engineering, emerging therefrom with
an S.A. to place between me and what was then a cold, cold
world. While this did not have a profound impact on prospective
employers, I finally did manage to convince the paint industry
that it needed me and spent seven very interesting years concoct-
ing a miscellany of brews for the beautification and protection of
home and industry. At that point, the rubber industry appeared
to offer more opportunity and I transferred my allegiance to the
Armstrong Cork Company in their South Braintree plant. Since
1942 I have been plant chief chemist. This title when translated
means I miss most of the fun and get all of the nasty problems.

I get a lot of credit for being smart or lucky or both in ac-
quiring Frances, ‘Tommy and Peter. We manage to have a lot of
fun as a family and expect to continue doing just that. However,
the boys are now taller than their mother and probably will over-
haul their father soon, so the pattern will change what with
college, summer jobs, dates, dances, etc. Fanny and I sometimes
get a little nostalgic about our “little” boys but it’s been a reward-
ing experience and we look forward to more of the same.

See you all in June!

THE story of how I have used this quarter century simply
wouldn’t sell. I can boast no unusual experiences, no exciting
war records, no books written and no political achievements.
Yet it has been an active and full life.

Following graduation I spent two years in the less hallowed
halls of the Business School. With education behind me, my
first step was getting married and my second was going to work
for The First Boston Corporation in 1935. My interest in the se-
curities business dated back to high school days, so I’m not sur-
prised I started my bread winning in it and even less surprised
at still being in it with the same firm. It hasn’t been quite as
planned. My hope was to get into selling and be located in our
Chicago office, so naturally I wound up and stayed in buying
in New York. I spend most of my time on the origination of
new corporate security issues, some on other labors, and the bal-
ance on vacation, which is the best reason for working.

We began our eastern life by spending a year in Brooklyn.
Then, deciding we needed more air, we moved to Pelham in
Westchester County and I hope we never move again. It has
been a grand place to live and to raise a family. Betsy and I
boast of three daughters, two now in college and a third fighting
her way through age fifteen. I hope she wins for the sake of
our own survival.

Changes in beliefs and mental attitudes? Of course. I’m a good
deal Jess sure of all the answers than twenty-five years ago, some-
what mellowed in spirit, probably more irritable, but still out-
spoken about things and people. Perhaps I am a failure as a
diplomat, but no one need wonder where I stand. In politics
I changed from Democrat to Republican in 1936, but since the '
two parties have seemed to change into most of each other’s
clothing during this period, it hasn’t felt strange. I must say
I’m increasingly distressed at political trends and neither party
gives me much encouragement for a change. The growing stress
on personal security through the State and the withering effects
of high taxation on individual initiative omen poorly for the

[415 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

future. Back of this, I believe, has been a long and gradual
change in our nation from its original form of a republic to a
democracy, and the latter is a perfect environment for develop-
ing the habit of eating the seed corn. But back to me, no change
in religious belief as a Roman Catholic. I have found this con-
viction a great comfort in eliminating false starts, mental | agita-
tion, and the couches of the psy choanalysts.

Like others, I have found interest and satisfaction in community
affairs. I served six years as an elected village trustee. With onl

a single party slate, it was quite easy to be elected. My contri-
butions to the arts and sciences are well hidden to date, so I have
joined a number of clubs to fill out my obituary. Golf remains my
favorite sport and pastime, and I can still break eighty. This is
most annoying to my old roommate, Bill Schroeder, who 1s about
to pay me on a twenty-five-year bet. He long ago predicted
my rapid physical deterioration, to be evidenced by golf results,
but to date the only proof of his forecast is grey hair, bifocals
and a larger belt.

These years have been good to us in family, friends and life
in general, and Betsy and I are grateful. The good fortune and
progress we have enjoyed confirm the old adage that it’s better
to be lucky than smart.

UPON graduating from college, I fulfilled a childhood ambition
to follow in the footsteps of an older brother in the field of
medicine. After receiving a medical degree, I spent several years
in clinical hospital work which carried through the war years. I
then decided to specialize in ophthalmology and finally in 1946, I
started practice in Portland. It has since continued to be a very
happy and successful one and only recently I was honored with
the appointment as chief of the Eye Service in the new Maine
Medical Center. .

As a bachelor, life proceeded on a fairly even keel until 1951.
In that fateful year, while on a skiing vacation — and under the
influence of the high altitude —I met the young lady who six
months later became my wife. Along with her I acquired a step-
son, During the past six years, two more children were born so
that we now have three boys, aged fourteen, six and two years.
Needless to say, my mode of living has been slightly modified.
Life has become somewhat hectic and at times strenuous (for one
about to celebrate his Twenty-fifth). But all in all, the past six
years have been some of the happiest ones in my life.

Fortunately, as a family, we continue to enjoy my favorite
recreations, sailing and skiing. For a hobby, aside from raising
children, I dabble in horticulture and landscaping. As for any
convictions, life has been moving along so fast that I have had little

THE urge for public office invaded even our household. In 1954,

I was elected (after one previous unsuccessful trial run) a trustee

of the Brookline Public Library and was re-elected in 1955 for a

three-year term. This post I find quite interesting, what with

serving as chairman of the Finance Committee and skirmishing
with book banning.

All the foregoing is non-partisan (so-called). I am a registered
Republican; but vote as I please; and have never neglected the
civic duty to vote. However there is one thing that I have never
been able to fathom — what species of “bug” is it that invades
even the most intelligent man that makes him continue in office
(be it in public life or private enterprise) beyond the peak of his
productivity or real usefulness?

As for mundane matters, I have further expanded my offices,
since our Twentieth Reunion, at Rooms 312-319 Barristers Hall,
Pemberton Square, Boston; and am now involved, besides my
regular accounting and tax practice, with promoting corporate
mergers. This merger field is particularly fascinating (and in-
cidentally quite rewarding) in that it has finally given free reign
to my original ideas of entering the investment field in 1937.
However, despite the “big executive” complex drilled into me by
the Harvard Business School and with 1933-37 being the lean
years that they were, I decided at that time that three meals a
day were better than being God’s gift to the investment field;
hence, my accounting endeavors. But now things are quite differ-
ent and my latent investment tendencies are coming to the fore
once more. )

As for the family, I still make it a point to watch and admire
the growing-up of my seven-year-old daughter (much spoiled by
her doting grandparents as usual), as well as encourage my wife's
communal activities, especially with the National Council of
Jewish Women, of which organization she is a national board
member.

For sports, I play golf, often teaming up with my wife who is
a better than average golfer. My daughter has forced me to
resume tennis at which I was quite good in my “youth,” but

[ 419 ]

which I now find is more than a match for my weary bones, |
like to watch football games; but after the last Harvard-Yale
football game at New Haven (0-54), I began to wonder whether
school sports were engaged in really to promote and foster
sportsmanship or merely to satisfy basic animal impulses to kick
a fellow when he is down. I sure felt sorry for our new Coach
Yovicsin and the injury-ridden Harvard team.

All in all, the last twenty-five years have been good to me,
Even when I do want to complain, I take one look at the next
fellow and feel much better at once. And I am looking forward
to the next quarter century as years of even greater service and

fulfillment.

IN retrospect, twenty-five years is a long time, yet as I write
I can see those years pass in review in a few fleeting moments.
Vaguely I recall the dreams of 1933, but one look at my recently
received photograph shocks me into the realities of twenty-five
years later. The dreams are best forgotten; some of the realities
are rather pleasant. .
Nineteen thirty-three was hardly the year for a hopeful chem-
ist to look for a job in his chosen field. I was lucky enough to find
an opening in the research department of the George O. Jenkins
Company, a small fiber board mill in Bridgewater, Massachusetts.
After a few years, I left for greener pastures and became director

[ 421 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

of research for a company in New Hampshire and then chief
chemist for another firm in Massachusetts. Meanwhile, the Jenk-
ins Company, for whom I had worked initially, had grown to
two mills in the East and another in the Midwest. At the height
of their growth in 1953, I returned to the Jenkins Company
as chief chemist. In 1954, I became their technical director, the
position I now hold.

When I talk with today’s graduates who are about to enter
industry, my hope is that 1933 belongs to the dark ages. The
beginner's pay check today is a far.cry from the struggle of our
day. However, I shudder to think of the two wars that it took
to bring about this prosperity and the defense spending required
to maintain it.

If fate was kind to me in my work, my personal life has been
even more fortunate. In 1950 I married Ruth Epstein Young, and
a year later adopted David, her son by a previous marriage. In
a short span of time, Ruth has filled a great void in my life and
watching David grow from a ten-year-old child to a seventeen-
year-old college freshman has given me much to be proud of.
Age places one in a position to make comparisons. Having re-
cently gone through the anxious period of helping my own son
get into college (The University of Massachusetts), I thank my
stars that I went to Harvard when I did. I don’t think I could
make it today. ‘

Being technical director of a company with three mills be-
tween Massachusetts and Illinois, in an industry that is extremely
sensitive to technological change, leaves me with very little spare
time. My interest in the statistical handling of chemical and en-
gineering data drew me into the Statistical Committee of the
Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry.

On the community level, I have placed a great deal of emphasis
in Boy Scout work. Having watched my son’s progress in Scout-
ing through the rank of Eagle, my own involvement was quite
natural. Before I knew it, I became chairman of Leadership
Training of the Brockton Council, Boy Scouts of America.

My professional and community activities must compete for
time with our new home which has much too much land. My

wife and I, both originally confirmed apartment dwellers, have
now become “experts” in landscaping, lawn care, and septic tanks.

IF I were to rate my experiences during the past twenty-five years
on the basis of the pleasure and satisfaction derived therefrom,
our canoe trip into Quetico Province Park just north of the
Minnesota border in the summer of 1956 would probably head the
list. Travel in the wilderness throws a group on its own resources;
as an activity to knit together a congenial family unit it is un-
surpassed. In our artificial civilization, beset with all sorts of com-
plicated social pressures, opportunities to work and play with
one’s children are rare indeed.

My professional interest in biology coupled with a love for the
beauty and peace of wild places has led to one of my major
preoccupations, the preservation of natural areas. This work
has involved considerable travel around the country and for the
past two years I have been serving as president of the Nature

Conservancy, the national organization concerned with this
type of conservation.

In the Class, I am among the lucky few whose careers were
interrupted neither by the depression nor by World War II. After
receiving my Ph.D. at Harvard in 1937, Esther and I spent a de-
layed two months’ honeymoon in Central Africa, where we
collected plants for the Gray Herbarium, which was followed
by a delightful year in Copenhagen on an American-Scandinavian
Foundation fellowship. My first job was in the Botany Depart-

I was busy training premedical students under the V-12 program.

immediately adjacent to the campus, has a fine collection of trees
and shrubs native to the northeastern United States, as well as
various areas devoted to special research projects involving the
experimental manipulation of vegetation with herbicides and
other techniques.

My special research interest has been the physiology of growth
and I have received grants from the National Institutes of Health
for studies on the growth of roots. These investigations have in-
volved the extraction and identification of highly fluorescent
compounds from the roots and a study of the effects of these sub-
stances upon normal growth.

My daughter, Minda, graduated from Putney School in Ver-
mont last year and is now a freshman at Radcliffe with interests
in science and music, Dicky, a junior at Putney, also has leanings
toward science ‘and shares a passion for skiing with his father.
The family now having flown the coop. Esther has become in-

volved with various civic activities such as the League of Women
Voters and the local Child Guidance Clinic, and we both have
participated in the program of the Unitarian-Universalist Church.
Our latest acquisition is a half-interest in a 170-acre farm and
woodland in East Haddam, Connecticut. Esther and I find the
peace and phoneless quiet of this hideout an increasingly needed

therapy to restore body and soul from the fatigue of a hyper-
active life.

HAVING reached the period in life when perspective can be
realized, I now take a bird’s eye look from this height of time
at the years since graduation (ever mindful too that similar at-
tempts were made in 1936, 1948, and 1953). Physically there is
an accumulation of weight which has done no harm, a loss of
hair which leaves something to be desired, a slowing down of

[425 ]

tempo which adds to an appreciation vicariously of the energy
of youth.

The indecision of concentration in specialized fields of the min-
istry ( a first love of the social services and an executive inclina-
tion) has given way to the close personal relationship of a parish
clergyman and his flock, which includes aspects of both these
interests. Parish life has been extremely varied, from the so-
cially-minded atmosphere of Emmanuel Church, Boston, to the
intimate village life of Christ Church, Glendale, Ohio; to the
diocesan-centered life at St. Paul’s Cathedral in Boston; to the
mill town workers of St. James Church in New Bedford, Massa-
chusetts; to All Saints Church, Attleboro, Massachusetts, with its
skilled craftsmen; and now at Trinity Church, Portland, Maine,
and its solid middle class church people. Mine has been a fas-
cinating ministry.

Two facets of my life have followed as adjuncts to my pro-
fession. A distinct contribution in the ecumenical church field has
been expressed through leadership in the Councils of Churches
on the local level of New Bedford and Attleboro, Massachusetts,
and Portland, Maine; and on a state level in Massachusetts and
in Maine, where I am currently president of the State Council.
Each summer institutional camping has played an important part
in my family life, culminating in 1957 with Estelle, Barbara, Bob
and myself acting as counselors and Johnny a camper with me
at North Woods Camp in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, where
I am the only charter member of this Boston “Y” organization
founded in 1929. My interest there is in crafts, which has de-
veloped greatly over the years since a short-time employment
with the Moore Leather Company, Boston, before college.

Barbara is now in Wellesley College and Bob expects to be
in college in the fall of 1958. Family life of common interests
and the fascination of living in an Episcopal Church rectory have
provided rich experience for every member of our family and
we have not encountered a dull moment.

Certain convictions have crystallized over the years, such as
the importance of the church in the life of every family, the
local community and our nation; the presence of God in history
which bodes well for the future in spite of present problems
of social tension and international power moves; and the knowl-

[ 426 ]

edge that it is important to stand up and be counted on vital
issues but to conform on unimportant ones. I know what it is
like to be “on the band wagon” with the majority and to be a
“sore thumb” with a small minority; out of which comes the
further conviction that men everywhere must learn to live with
each other in harmony in spite of serious differences.

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

MY Harvard career was of short duration. I entered in 1930 as
a provisional sophomore from St. Francis College, Loretto, Penn-
sylvania, and left in 1932 at the end of my junior year. However,
to the extent that education is a process of maturation, I was
“educated” in a hurry at Harvard. The values I learned there
were responsible for a decision I did not want to make — to leave
Harvard and continue at a school I could afford to attend. And
so in that bleak year of 1932, I left Harvard and went to live
with an aunt and uncle in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Indiana is a
coal-mining, farming community about sixty miles east of Pitts-
burgh and is the home of Indiana State Teachers College. I en-
rolled there, worked part-time in my uncle’s clothing store, and
graduated in July, 1934, with an S.B. degree in education.

After graduation I was one of the lucky ones. The day before
school started, I got a job teaching in an elementary school not
far from Indiana; an experience rich in everything but money.
After teaching two years, I accepted an offer of a temporary po-
sition with the Veterans Administration in connection with the
payment of the bonus to the veterans of World War I. I re-
mained in government service in one capacity or another, pri-
marily statistical in nature, until 1942, mainly in Washington,
D.C. However, there were several detours, one of short duration
to the Canal Zone with the Navy Department and another of
several years to Wheeling, West Virginia, with the Bituminous
Coal Commission.

In 1942 I enlisted in the Army in order to escape the draft
board, which had trouble classifying me. As I recall, I was first
classified as 1A, then 1B, then came an occupational deferment
and then back to 1A again. By this time, I was an industrial
specialist in bituminous coal at the War Production Board. While
a second occupational deferment was pending, I decided to
make up their mind. I enlisted in the Signal Corps and in due
course found myself overseas in the Air Force as an operations
analyst assigned to the 13th Air Force. In that status, I went from
New Guinea to Tokyo via the usual Southwest Pacific Stations
and returned to the United States in 1946.

Upon my return I went back to work for Uncle Sam in Wash-
ington. This time with the War Assets Administration’ where I
attained my highest government position, namely, chief of the Re-

[ 428 ]

view and Analysis Branch of the Personal Disposal Division. In
the main, the function of the branch was to measure the disposal
progress of the billions of dollars worth of surplus personal
property that the War Assets Administration was encharged
with liquidating. I enjoyed the work immensely. However, with
a temporary agency, the inevitable happened. And in 1949, I
was out of a job.

Then followed several years selling various products, in the
course of which I met the wonderful girl who is now my wife —
Florence Davidson, a widow with a four-year-old boy, Bobby.
We were married in 1951. In that year, I entered the insurance
field and made reasonable progress. In 1952, our little pixie,
Marsha, was born and under the impetus of stepped-up family
needs, I decided to start my own insurance agency. To have
something special to offer, the agency specializes in hard-to-

lace automobile risks for banks and auto finance companies.
With the help of my wife, I am glad to say that our progress the
past several years has been more rapid. The work is now fun
and that, of course, is in itself a special form of progress.

From time to time, I have dreamt of the possibility of “some-
day” returning to Harvard and completing the requirements for a
degree. The Dean has informed me that I am a senior still in good
standing. In that case, I would have the rather dubious distinction
of being, no doubt, the oldest graduate of the Class of 33. How-
ever, more realistically, I have decided to bequeath that piece of
unfinished business to my son who tells me he will begin the job in

1964.

SOME twenty years ago, shortly after my term at Harvard Law
School, Jane and I left the East Coast for the Chicago area where
I started to work immediately at the laboratories of G. D. Searle
& Company. I have been at Searle ever since and have never
regretted one moment of it. The company, specalizing in medical
research, has had a steady and yet spectacular growth and we
here have all grown with it. Since we have other installations
abroad, I have enjoyed some travel.

My wife, Jane, who will be remembered by a number of 733
members as Jane Snyder, Radcliffe ’36, loved most of the activities
I enjoyed, and so for years we’ve fished and hunted all over the
West. We liked golf too, and she was very adept at it, even more
so than I. Our life was indeed wonderful until in one split second
it ended last July 27th, with Jane’s death as a result of a tragic
accident. Margaret MacGregor Magie, Radcliffe ’28, sister of
Bob MacGregor of our Class, wrote the following in a recent
Radcliffe Quarterly, from which I would like to quote briefly.

Jane Snyder Gorman died following a tragic accident on
July 27, 1957. During a swimming and diving exhibition
at the Sunset Ridge Country Club, she fell down a flight of
concrete steps, the gate to which had been inadvertently
left open and which she did not see in the darkness when she
was returning to the pool-side to rejoin her family. ...

For a number of years she has served on our Scholarship
Committee and for over two years she had been treasurer of
the Radcliffe Club of Chicago. To her and to her ever-
generous husband, who opened a number of doors for us, we
owe our financial successes in our Art Tours. Methodical,
scrutinizing, she also brought imagination to her job. We
think it very fitting that a Memorial Scholarship Fund has
been established in her name. .

SINCE leaving Harvard, from which I did not graduate, my first
full-time job (in the deep depression of 1933) was with the De-
partment of Public Assistance, State of Pennsylvania. (My
Master’s came after this.) In 1937, I was employed with the
National Labor Relations Board at the munificent salary of $2500.
per year. After seven years with the Board preventing and settling
labor disputes throughout the country and in practically every
industry and receiving letters of commendation from both com-

[ 431 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

panies and unions (and that’s not easy to do), I transferred to the
War Production Board in Washington, D.C.

At WPB I was chief in the Industrial Relations Division with
a staff of a hundred persons in the field and a group of professional
employees in Washington responsible to me. ‘Those were hectic
days (1943-46) when it was extremely important to keep produc-
tion going in war plants throughout the United States, to prevent
strikes and labor disputes and to maintain wages on an even keel.

In 1946, I became director of Industrial Relations and Personnel —
for a division of a company employing 100,000 people. My work
was primarily on the east coast. Subsequently I opened my own
offices in Philadelphia as an industrial relations and public rela-
tions consultant. During the Korean Conflict I was called back
to Washington. The Wage and Stabilization Board put me on as
the congressional and public liaison. Among other duties, I met
often with Congressmen and Senators, union officials as well as
representatives of industry and the general public. My work was
to keep these groups well informed on the activities of the Board,
assisting in the formulation of policy and regulations, setting up
wage panels at the request of the chairman and the President of
the United States. .

When things started phasing out at the Wage Board, I opened
offices in Washington as consultant in public relations, industrial
relations and government relations. I had a number of clients
throughout the country, made a number of interesting trips, dealt
with most of the New Deal and Fair Deal agencies and piled up
a good reputation for cutting red tape for industry and getting
things done fast and for expediting the handling of applications
and projects by these agencies.

Then, as usually happens when a new administration comes in,
many of the agencies, departments and offices were eliminated.
Although I was still doing pretty well representing such diverse
organizations as a modeling school, a college, a church, and a radio
program, in 1955 I went to work for the then Foreign Operations
Administration, since changed to the International Cooperation
Administration of the Department of State. I am still here work-
ing with foreign governments, embassies, our overseas Missions,
private firms, individual technicians and universities in the United
States. I have the very interesting job of helping to build up the

[ 432 ]

standard of living as well as the economic conditions in various
countries. The Washington Cocktail circuit occasionally i invites
me in especially since I am unmarried. It seems that I was always
too busy to get around to that. Anyway, here I sit in Washington
taking some little part in its dynamic and ever-changing political,
social, economic and amazing whirl.

IN March of 1933, the financial world, aware that a specialist in
“Money and Banking” was about to leave Harvard, declared a
“Bank Holiday.” After six years of careful study and analysis
of stocks and bonds, I was on the verge of creating a financial
empire when the whole world revolted and cried out — WAR!
Although I joined the Navy in 1942, it took foreign intelligence
service three years to discover the fact, with the understandable
resule — Unconditional Surrender!

Small wonder that I should turn from destroying the established
order of things to a more constructive attitude. Fortunately, I
have been associated with a company that has been established
for thirty-six years, and has installed airconditioning, heating,
ventilating and power plants in most of the largest projects in
New Fngland, We have a good organization that endeavors to

[ 434]

2§TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

install high quality work. This creates a pleasant bond in our
relationship with clients and allows a wholesome satisfaction at
the completion of each new project. This also has brought us
repeated contracts and established friendships which tend to make
working an attractive, pleasant and rewarding necessity.

In April of 1943, I made my wisest and most profitable invest-
ment, a merger, from which I have acquired five very active and
growing subsidiaries; Ruth, who inherited her mother’s charm
and beauty; Jack, a Barry Wood type of scholar and athlete;
Martha, literally an angel; Tommy, a combination of Irad Hardy,
Woof Hallowell and Laurie Cohen — strong, rugged, fast, a lover
of football and a hater of women, and little Jean Marie, fast taking
over as chairman of the board.

Academically, I am progressing rather well, having passed all
my subjects, with honors, for the sixth, fifth, third, and kinder-
garten classes — although I must admit I am being tutored in
spelling and pronunciation by a two-year-old spinster. Studies,
Little League baseball, football, swimming, hiking — if by hobbies
you mean what I do mostly after work, I would say my hobby
is picking up after the kids.

At this stage, under present circumstances, I find that my
material assets move along with the tide. Martha’s incurable
disease, Cystic Fibrosis, and the plight of others like her have
compensated by giving us an awareness of the real values in life,
a deeper appreciation of the joy and beauty of living and a firm
faith in the friendliness of people and a closer union with God.
Circumstances may get out of control, but our conduct is under
our own control and we remain very grateful, contented and

happy.

FOLLOWING graduation I spent a year at the Graduate School
of Engineering where I acquired an S.M. in Civil Engineering.
The following two years I served as an assistant in the School
while accumulating data for a thesis, the writing of which took
up much of my spare time until 1938. In 1936 I took a position in
a firm of consulting engineers in New York, where I spent a
professionally beneficial four years in the analysis and design
of foundations and waterfront structures. The conversion of
Flushing Meadows into a park and the supporting of the 1938
World’s Fair building thereon, foundations for suspension bridges,
and the underpinning of skyscrapers in connection with subway
construction exemplify the variety of interesting problems to
which I was exposed. The acquisition of a steady job encouraged
me to acquire a wife, also in 1936. She outlasted the job!

Residence in Manhattan did not appeal to two New Englanders
sO we set up apartment keeping in Pelham where there were
trees, grass and houses, and whence the commuting to 42d Street
took but thirty minutes. Our recreation in those days consisted
chiefly of tennis, skating and badminton.

In 1940 we acquired first a daughter, then a new job, and
finally mobility in the form of a second-hand Ford (only $300
with 20,000 miles on it, a fact I can’t avoid mentioning because
today it seems almost incredible). In the fall of that year I became
an assistant professor in the College of Engineering at New York
University and in the ensuing few months struggled hard to
anticipate all the questions that emanated from my classes. As
a result J learned a lot and 1 hope my students did also. By the

[ 436 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

following summer, numerous architect-engineer combinations
were frantically planning military bases so I entered into this form
of activity for a brief time. Thereafter, academic life was no
longer “normal” since we were called upon to train inspectors for
industry, engineers for air base design and camouflage, and
G.I.s for supervision of Corps of Engineers activities. Twelve
weeks of instruction followed by a week “off” became the rule
the year round. I can recall skiing in Stowe, summer and fall
camping in Maine, but always no more than enough to whet the
appetite. We moved to Bronxville, next door to a tennis court
which we patronized constantly between bouts with a victory
garden. Somehow or other I managed to undertake considerable
consulting work in these busy times and to produce some original
publications.

In 1945 came an opportunity to return to Maine in the dual
role of soils engineer for the State Highway Commission, and
professor of civil engineering at the University of Maine where
I had my headquarters. After nine years in Gotham, it would be
pleasant to move again in a rural environment, and the op-
portunity to preach less and to practice more of my profession
was likewise appealing. So we moved northward in time to
enjoy a cool full summer. Housing and goods were scarce at
that time and “do-it-yourself” though not yet popularized at
that time was necessary as well as enjoyable. Apartment living
offers little outlet for whatever mechanical dexterity one may
possess, but in trying to modernize an old house in times of
scarcity one quickly acquires in some measure the skills of car-
penter, mason, plumber and electrician. Possession of a home of
our own was soon followed by the advent of a second daughter.

For all ten years I supervised all investigations and preliminary
planning for foundations of roads and bridges built by the state,
and at the university taught only my specialty. Professionally,
this was an ideal situation. Between travels about the state ]
managed a little hunting, fishing, skiing and similar activities of
which I am particularly fond. We resided in Bangor, a con-
venient location with forest close by and the ocean within easy
reach. ‘

In 1948 I took a leave of absence for three months to supervise
the preliminary investigations for an ore dock on the Island of

[ 437 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

Cyprus, a fascinating place historically, archaeologically and
scenically. This together with a little preliminary conferring
and travel in Britain represents the extent of my foreign experi-
ence to date.

In the spring of 1955 I was asked to assume responsibility for
the improvement and subsequent welfare of the Department of
Civil Engineering at Ohio State University, an institution best
known for its prowess on the gridiron. However, it is not com-
pletely oblivious to others, and there is considerable sentiment
in favor of achieving prominence in the scholastic world. Owing
to administrative neglect and to indifference of long standing the
affairs of the entire College of Engineering had remained static
for many years. The needs of the Civil Engineering Department
were so obvious that I decided to try my hand at a completely new
venture, and in the fall moved to Columbus where we now live.
I believe that progress is being made, but think it will be another
three years before all reactionary attitudes can be overcome by
democratic action.

Meanwhile, life in Ohio, reputed to be the foremost industrial
state, is rather unlike that in Maine. A long spring and fall mean
plenty of tennis, but the winters are worthless, the fishing un-
productive, and the waters swarming with speedboats! This
is not, however, a lament, but rather a desire for perfection in
all things. Since the desire is unattainable, we settle for part (the
children take all) of the summers in Maine, and begrudge only
the time spent in going to and from.

THIS account will be brief! Partially because available time is!
Partially because on some of the past I'd rather! And, partially
because if I still hope to have it in the Class Report, it had better!

Previous reports have covered much of what has transpired
since leaving Cambridge and most of which was — up until quite
recently, in so many ways, a very ordinary existence that I shall
not bore you with it here. Most of you who remember me know
it and those who don’t won’t miss it! However, within the past
year, something inspired (?) me to “Make one heap of all (my)
winnings and risk it on one turn of Pitch and Toss.” This re-
sulted in my resignation on June 24th last from the national organi-
zation with which I had been associated for some twenty-one
years, effective August first. Establishing myself as a real estate
and general insurance agent, The Gray Agency, I am now travel-
ing along this road principally with the life, accident and health
lines of the Travelers of Hartford. The ‘Wheel of Fortune” is
still turning and I can not at this time say if it will be a case of
win or “loss.” I can truthfully say I enjoy my new profession and
the very real challenge it is presenting to me! If I’m at the Re-
union, it will be because I am still on top.

I often feel as if I am living out a second lifetime with the
obvious advantage of a previous one to guide me. I place a great
deal more value on the little happiness in this one! Enjoy more
of those fragile and fleeting moments with my wife and children;
because I can now remember how quickly they are past and gone
—— never again to be savoured with the relish of true experience.
If my (often slowly turning) “Wheel of Fortune” stops because
I took time out to take my little son Lee deer hunting, I shall yet
be richer for having this memory of enjoyment shared together.
His proud “I went hunting with MY Daddy” is typical of count-
less incidents shared with my family and enduring for all our

[ 439 ]

lives. Too often, I recall, the urgency of earning a living and
aspiring to grasp more dollars or advancement has robbed my
loved ones and myself of many real treasures of life. Be it not so,
in this one...

Speaking of treasures, to those of you who read this and re-
member, there are many “treasured memories” of our college ex-
pericnces which I do hope and plan to enjoy with you again one
of these days. When I was at Harvard, I had not yet lost sight
of the real values in the ensuing mad rush for things material.

Brief —I said! Well, I'd better stop and get to work or I shall
not have time — to shirk!

been teaching American Art and Architecture to European stu-

Leopolds-kron in Salzburg. I am going again in March and April
this year for the same purpose. During both former trips the
whole .family accompanied me and we had occasion to spend
several months touring Europe from Portugal to England. These
experiences vivified my impressions of American art and life
and made a recent long excursion through the United States, es-
pecially the West and Southwest (in preparation for my book)
more rewarding. In a word, I am devoted to the American scene
and the work of American artists and architects.

Jonathan is a sophomore at Bowdoin and Sam is at Putney

psychology which marriage and a family interrupted; and girls
are easier than boys to bring up — at least if ours are typical.

[ 444]

2§TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

brother and I started our present company, Fairhope Fabrics,
Inc., which after twenty years has finally achieved a certain ma-
turity, It is a typical small business in the highly competitive
textile field, with all the problems of trying to run a northern
operation versus southern competition. We have managed to hold
our own by making specialized products such as insulation tapes,
rubber elastic bandages, dishcloths, etc.

I am content with my business life, although I often wish I had
gone into a more dynamic industry with a greater potentiality
of growth. However, I must admit to a certain sense of satis-
faction in knowing that as long as my company stays in business,
I have a job. I also dabble in real estate and perhaps if I could go
back the twenty-five years, I might well have gone into this field.

I married the only and the right girl for me. Irma will be sur-
prised to read this because what I originally put down (for her
editing) was much more modest. She has been not only a wonder-
ful wife and mother, but a real companion — intellectually and
socially. We enjoy talks about politics, philosophy, economics,
life, etc. etc. — just the two of us, Not bad in this TV age!

We have three very active daughters and no man could ask for
lovelier children. I hope that the men with sons don’t think it’s
sour grapes, but I really have not missed having a boy — yet.
Girls today are almost as athletic and their games are as strenuous
as the boys’ — at least during these early years.

I spent three years in the Army — in grade as a PFC for twenty-
seven months — ending up as a sergeant. I guess you knew that
Gross was a potential military genius! Prior to going into the
service in 1942, I spent some months in Washington in the Com-
pliance Division of the War Production Board. It was a frustrat-
‘ing but illuminating experience and I kind of like to think that I
rocked the boat a bit down there (that Harvard skepticism) and
possibly did a little bit of good.

My travels through the country have been fairly extensive,
though primarily on business. However, I don’t foresee any Euro-
pean or World trips until our children are grown. We are a
closely knit family and spend a great deal of time together at
home, I am getting a terrific kick out of watching my daughters
grow up.

Politically, I am a Roosevelt New Dealer who feels that Eisen-

[ 445 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

hower’s presidency has turned out badly. However, I believe that
the Democrats had become complacent and that the Eisenhower
years have endowed them with a greater sense of responsibility
which should result in a better administration when they are
returned to office in 1960.

I am a member of Temple Beth-El, which is the reformed
branch of Judaism, but I regret that I have not been more active
in Temple affairs. I hope to remedy this before our Fiftieth!

One of my major activities has been to study our national eco-
nomic ups and downs and in 1948 I wrote a pamphlet entitled 4
Theory to Stabilize the Business Cycle. According to this theory,
the current recession or depression, whichever you may call it,
was evident. I follow the stock market quite closely, and while I
called the downturn too early, it did come as I thought it would.
One of my great concerns is with those who preach that steady
and continued inflation is a normal and necessary part of our
economic life and that there is no limit to the height which prices
can reach. To counteract recession and to maintain a sound
economy, prices must be stabilized and the purchasing power of
the consumer increased by raising his “real” income (details avail-
able to the Administration upon request).

As I went to list the various organizations to which I belong
and the offices which I should have held, I was struck by the
realization that my biggest failure in these twenty-five years has
been my lack of participation in organizational work. I have tried
to contribute financial as well as moral support in full measure,
but I must admit that I am not taking an active part. During the
early years J spent virtually all of my time working and since my
marriage (which was not quite twelve years ago) I have been ex-
tremely busy with my family. However, I now pledge that when
my children are grown I will actively work in some of the very
many worthwhile organizations in which I am interested.

I, along with the rest of you, have had my share of problems,
but since they have been so outweighed by the very wonderful
things that have happened, I can say with all sincerity —I would
change places with no man,

SITTING down to write my “Class Life,” I am acutely aware
that if today’s admission standards to Harvard prevailed in 1929,
I would probably have been spared this effort. My life since
graduation puts me in no danger of suddenly finding myself on the
“This is Your Life” program. However, this quarter of a century
has been distinctly a lot of fun.

Careerwise, I have made several changes. Initially, I entered
the banking field. In 1933, there were certainly few business op-
portunities. If large corporations were sending teams of personal
representatives to universities, as they are today, to interview
seniors, then they definitely overlooked me. A short while after
being in the banking business I realized that it would be a long
time before a banking career would afford an opportunity to earn
more than a bare living. I left National City Bank to become a
registered representative with the investment firm, Hornblower
& Weeks. The work was both interesting and remunerative, and
I have maintained an active continuing interest in the securities
market.

In World War II, I was in the Army Air Force doing statistical
control work in the Air Service Command at Wright Field,
Dayton, Ohio, At the completion of the war, I entered sales and
management work at Byerlyte Corporation, one of the country’s
leading independent asphalt manufacturers, and am presently
located at Byerlyte. The work involves sales on a national basis
and has been interesting and financially rewarding. I have ap-
preciated the advantage of working for a relatively small concern

[ 447 J

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

where the executives are not subject to overnight switches in resi-
dence.

I have enjoyed my family life and consider myself fortunate
in having been able to continue to live in the same city with my
parents and my brother and his family. To me, it has been a real
source of satisfaction to know that my parents gained enjoyment
from regularly being with their children and grandchildren,
while in no way interfering with the children’s lives.

In our children, we have been fortunate, having boy and girl
twins. There is constant activity and interplay as each is more
active than the average child. Sometimes, however, in the interest
of peace and quiet, their more introverted parents wish that some-
day their extroverted natures will be somewhat modified.

Tennis, swimming, and indoor ice skating provide recreation
year round. The sale of puts and calls in the securities market
provides less strenuous but more exciting activity. My wife and I
both have quite definite nonconformist religious tendencies, We
were instrumental in establishing the Cleveland Ethical Society, a
member of the American Ethical Union. This is a nondenomina-
tional religious group with no dogma or creeds whose members
come from varied backgrounds. The stress is on man’s relation to
man and on human relationships leaving belief in various meta-
physical concepts entirely up to the individual.

In politics, I can see little difference between the Republicans
and the Democrats. There are only “ins” and “outs” with the
welfare state and inflation here to stay regardless of which party
is in power. ;

Apparently the Russian launching of the Sputnik has done a
good deal more than the eloquence of Wendell Willkie in driving
home the One World idea. Ironically, the Sputnik will be re-
sponsible for real advances in American education, The gap be-
tween the salaries of Russian professors, $35,000 to $50,000 a year,
and those of American professors will certainly be in part closed.
Finally, we shall seek out and educate our really bright young
men and women — our really most important assets — rather than
having their financial circumstances be the controlling factor in
their development. Perhaps American education is entering 4

period of its greatest growth and development.

A PRESBYOPIC search through the mists of a quarter-century

ields an inventory of reasonably pleasant, exciting and, on the
whole, fortunate memories. It was easy, in 1933, to turn from the
job that wasn’t there back to Harvard as a special student in
chemistry to patch up the requirements for admission to medical
school. |

In 1941, following my internship at the Springfield (Mass.)
Hospital, I became the grateful beneficiary of a rapidly-growing,
but ersatz, practice when first one and then the other young
physicians of the town were called into service in our first year
of war. I was 4-F. However, I grew healthier as the war situa-
tion intensified, and I welcomed my entry into the Army in
September, 1942, as a relief from the demands of a doctor-short
community. My four stateside years in service were spent, suc-
cessively, in a brief airborne assignment, as a blood research offi-
cer, and finally bowing out from behind a desk in the Pentagon.
To me, Washington was an impersonal agglomeration of paper,
brass and marble wrapped in layers of dank, sticky and rheu-
matic weather. Nevertheless, the war did teach me that this

[ 449 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

country consisted of considerably more than Boston, Cambridge
and Providence.

My first year in practice, here in North Hollywood, was a
trying one, None of the very few people I knew in this strange,
new community seemed to be in need of my services; apparently
I had settled here for my health, not theirs. But I had forgotten
that, in the normal course of events, a professional following is a
slowly germinating thing. In the intervening years it has flowered
well and, despite repeated trimmings (I have given up obstetrics,
limited my office hours, and restricted house visits), has main-
tained its robust growth in a growing and burgeoning region, A
busy office spells pressures and. confusions, yet [am en) oying what
{ feel will be the tw ilight years of private, independent medical
practice in this country,

For diversion, I turn to my newly-purchased organ, competing
with Gloria’s piano practice and Solomon’s TV favorites. For-
tunately, our place is large enough to contain this cacophony
without becoming an electronic madhouse. I also dabble in real
estare and land investments. As a legacy from one of the latter
I find myself operating a nineteen-acre citrus grove in Chats-
worth, and so the newspaper offers not only sports and editorial
pages, but also frost warnings, rain forecasts and market quota-
tions on oranges and grapefruit.

The hat I wear most uneasily is that of a parent. Somewhere
along the line in my schooling and training I should have learned
a few things about handling children, but the answers escape me
whenever I am confronted with the constantly recurring dis-
ciplinary guidance problems. We'll forget about raising wu7-
derkinder or super-athletes. We'll settle for a couple of ordinary
adults who can just get along in this frenetic era. For the moment,
we shall depend on those two primitive devices of love and af-
fection.

IT REMEMBER in Cambridge that each year after Commencement
there used to be two or three graduates who would barricade
themselves in their rooms and refuse to leave. Less love of Har-
vard, probably, than fear of facing the outside world. I suppose
I am spiritually akin to those escapists, since I have remained in
the academic world from 1933 to the present moment and have
not the slightest intention of leaving in the visible future.

I went directly from Harvard to two years of graduate study
at Vanderbilt, then to eleven years of teaching English at the
University of Toledo, during which time I also commuted to
Ann Arbor where I completed my doctorate. I served for a year
as dean at Lincoln College, Illinois, before coming to my present

C451]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

position in 1947. My professional interests center around the
problem of how liberal education can be adapted to the realities
of contemporary life. More specifically, I have for the last ten
years been seeking ways to incorporate some of the humane
values into engineering education. My basic conviction is that
such values are too important to be left exclusively to the arts
colleges.

Outside my professional work I have been a liberal in politics, a
rencgade in religion, and a stubborn non-joiner socially. I have
helped raise a pleasant family, have recently acquired a small ul-
cer and a small grandchild, in that order, and am in the midst
of learning, to my dismay, that one who devotes his life to the
education of other people’s children does not in the ordinary

SOUL-SEARCHING in 1957 brings me to the usual tentative con-
clusions. It is now almost thirty years since enrolling at Harvard
and I find that the world has grown myopically larger, Harvard
has rounded itself out to ever plumper proportions, and I find
myself as microscopic as ever, out of joint with the times, out of
proportion to the scale of the world. This would be distressing
if it weren’t the pattern we discovered in the ’30s, or even the
pattern we invented. Fortunately, there are in this class enough
important and valuable people and VIP's in general to offset the

occuPATION: Religious broadcasting; director of Radio and TV production;
production supervisor, “Look Up and Live,” (CBS-TV), “Frontiers
of Faith,” (NBC-TV), “National Radio Pulpit,” (NBC), “Pilgrimage,”
(ABC).

MY life in show business, if that loose term embraces radio, tele-
vision, and recording, started well before graduation. Some few
of my classmates may remember a dance orchestra first called The
Confederates (if only because the musicians therein were non-
union), and later The Pied Pipers. I dallied with this as guitarist,
arranger, singer and leader for a year or more after graduation,
but rapidly found that the Messers. Newman and Marshard had
a stranglehold on what business was to be had in and around
Boston, and that, in any case, my temperament was ill-suited to
a lifetime of playing “businessman’s bounce.”

So, to New York and three years of writing continuity for radio
programs. Possibly this was penance for wasted opportunities in
college, more likely a valuable apprenticeship in the use of the
mass media. In any case, I was able to break away from the type-
writer to the studio in 1938, and have never since strayed far.
There were eleven years of productive and reasonably satisfying
work with World Broadcasting System, then the largest of radio
transcription companies, and with Decca Records, five years of
free-lancing, involving considerable association with the advertis-

[ 453 ]

ing business, and finally my present work (which I hope carries
on for many years to come) with the National Council of
Churches.

As this writing forces me to look back, I am struck by the divers
respects in which Harvard helped to shape the tools and tech-
niques with which I carry out my present happy task. As one in-
stance of many, Doc Davison, Woody, the Glee Club and Chapel
Choir gave me a knowledge and love of the great choral literature
which, I believe, could have been gathered as effectively in no
other way. In practical terms, what I learned from them has been
of incalculable value in my present work, which involves a con-
siderable association with church and university choirs.

Behind my present preoccupation with the use of the mass
media in communicating the Gospel lies a long history of sampling
most of the forms of Protestantism. I began singing at the age of
eight in the choir of a Canadian Methodist Church. There fol-
lowed excursions as a singer into Unitarian, Episcopal, Presbyte-
rian, Baptist and Swedenborgian churches, and then Harvard and
the Chapel Choir. After graduation my interest in organized
Christianity lapsed. A humanistic education of the sort Harvard
provided in our time, with its notion of the perfectibility of man
through the exercise of reason, discourages acceptance of Christian
dogma. And paid choir work can lead one to a light view of
liturgical practices. It is an observable fact, however, that with
the eruption of children into one’s life, and the consequent need
to dig roots, one’s interest in matters of the spirit is likely to
revive. Four years ago I had the rare pleasure of being confirmed,
in company with my eldest son, in the Protestant Episcopal
Church.

In my family I am blest. My sons came close to being what one
hopes his sons will be. Keith, the eldest, is a fine guitarist, a varsity
swimmer at his school and a good student. John, Jr., is a rock-
hound and chemist of parts. Brad’s major concern is with people,
all kinds and sizes. He loves them all, and they him. My wife,
Mary, is an abiding joy, good cook, good bridge-partner, good
company. Further, as our interests have become ever sharper in
their focus, she has become one of the most articulate of script-

writers in the whole field of religious broadcasting.

As to hobbies, life holds too many pleasures to allow an addic-

tion to any one or two. Bridge, yes. The milder forms of exer-
cise, notably golf, when occasion permits, Gardening, for sure,
and strictly organic. And books, finely printed books, George
Parker Winship and John Barnard Associates fanned the flame.

MY life since graduation holds many blessings. An understanding

spirit, adjusts herself to the peculiar demands of my work —
both the secrecy and the demands on my time. . . . Two sons
turning out fine — far more normal, socially adjusted, intellec-
tually curious, capable, personally responsible and organized,
harder driving than I was. 1 have been successful in giving them
the freedom to develop. . . . Hundreds of friends acquired along
the way — although only a few close ones, who provide that
wonderful feeling of belonging. ... Among the top 1500 in
Federal Civil Service. Government work “top” has its limita-

I do not set the policies, at least I get my two cents worth in at
the top —and I do see the top team making the decisions that
mean a safe future for all of us.

Business life divides nicely into blocks of confusion — the de-
pression where I learned little and got nowhere in the electrical]
cable business, but I did learn to work with people — all kinds —
and to work hard. The electrical power business where I finally
took my first steps upward and began learning my profession
(although I couldn’t recognize it) of Engineering/Planning.
. .. The forward look — blocking in the future and projecting
decisions based on both economics and technology. The war
years—-a chance to grow up — self-confidence returned —a
new start and a change from introvert to extrovert... people
have more fun and extroverts the most. I now consider myself
a “sensitive extrovert.”

The postwar decade —learning my trade, government, the
sciences, missiles, people, planning and thinking.

The present — graduation —a‘chance to deliver, or fail, to
apply learning, ability, knowledge to the largest problems of my
lifetime.

The future — each time I think I have learned all I can, I find
it is just a plateau. If 1 keep working, keep learning, keep that
“one feather Indian” viewpoint, know I am green, then I shall
grow. Perhaps this is what makes a profession — you are always
an apprentice for the next job — you are always learning.

Hobbies? I have enjoyed all the hobbies of both my children
and my friends. Children: To the fullest extent the children
encouraged — erector sets, model trains, outboard motors, water
skiing, camping, boats, small foreign autos... . Adult Recrea-
tion: Lecturing on my favorite subject of guided missiles. Ex-
ploring the back corners of the world in connection with my
business travels, you meet some of the most interesting people

in border-town bars .. . panting slowly while resting after

HONEST self-evaluation is difficult, The introspective ponder-
ing which I have engaged in during the past couple of hours,
trying to put something down on paper, has been good for me,
but I am sure it would not be very interesting for our classmates.
So, I have decided to be as factual as possible.

I went to work for Union Carbide Corporation on November
13, 1933. After various stops — including Fostoria, Ohio (twice);
Clarksburg, West Virginia; Columbia, Tennessee (twice); Niagara
Falls, New York; Chicago; Morganton, North Carolina; and since
1944, New York City —I find I am still working for the same
company. I spent some time in production, construction, sales
and employee relations (six solid years of direct negotiations with
labor unions) and, upon reflection, conclude that I have not con-
tributed to any fundamental knowledge in any of these fields.
However, it has all been fun. My job consists of trying to guide
our management people in the best employee benefit policies and
personnel practices we can achieve in order to attract superior
people to work for Union Carbide.

Ibby and I were married for fifteen years without children.
Now we have Kathy and Bobby, and our lives pretty much re-
volve around them. I still play a lousy game of golf, swim on
weekends and have just taken up squash tennis in an effort to lose
about ten pounds.

Secretary’s Note: Sports Illustrated, in December, 1957, selected
Hageman as one of 25 Silver All-America men. The criterion
used by a distinguished panel of judges was “achievement in career
and citizenship stretching over a generation” on the part of foot-
ball lettermen of 25 years ago, The 25 winners were picked from
an original submission of 75 names by 75 colleges. Incidentally,
Hageman’s opposite number in 1932, Capt. Wilbur of Yale, a vice-

IN thinking back over a quarter of a century, one is likely to
gain a favorable perspective on his own life. Perhaps memory
is overly kind since it seems to highlight the adventure and satis-
faction of absorbing activities while playing down the disap-
pointment and disillusion that inevitably jolt one from time to
time in his struggle to establish himself.

In any case, it is a fortunate person whose work encompasses
his interests, I was brought up in the midst of North Dakota’s
prairics and Minnesota’s lakes, and like most Midwesterners I
possess that sort of wanderlust which makes me not only like
the open spaces but also enjoy crossing them and even leaving
them by water, land and air. And by happy chance, this con-
genial type of assignment has been mine for much of the last
twenty-five years.

After working through and surviving the 1933 Christmas rush
in Macy’s Toy Department (together with an astonishing num-
Ler of other °33 graduates) I started my first real job with
Martindale-Hubbell, law directory publishers, the firm with
which J am now connected. From the very first, I enjoyed
everything about it, including the lawyers I visited. My work
took me south and wese in the United States, as well as far north
into Canada’s Prairie Provinces. My travel urge was to have

[ 458 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

been even more highly gratified when our company planned to
expand its business in South and Central America, but the war
intervened.

I joined Pan American Airways and worked in ground opera-
tions as dispatcher and airport manager in various stations of
the Atlantic division. PanAm, while operating U.S. Navy air-
craft on a contract basis, was establishing and developing new
stations all over the world. My assignments in this work took
me to Natal, Lagos, Dakar, Bathurst, Botwood, Port of Spain,
London and Karachi. We were handling flying boats requiring
much thrilling activity on the water — particularly when night
landings and take-offs were involved. Compared with today’s
routine operations, this was absorbing and challenging pioneer
work. At any rate, modern aircraft, in which I spend a not in-
considerable amount of time, seem prosaic indeed when com-
pared with those greatest boats of them all, the Boeing 314
Clippers.

Meanwhile, between my Port of Spain and London assign-
ments, I persuaded a charming and gifted Philadelphia girl to
become my wife. After Karachi, our revised plans fitted right
in with an opportunity to rejoin Martindale-Hubbell and to set-
tle down in America in a community having good schools and
good music, with theatres and beaches not too far away. The
decision to return to my former company was a happy one, and
my association with the firm has continued to be most congenial.
Although I now travel less, I find that being involved in sales
management is quite as stimulating as making sales themselves.

My leisure interests are now all connected with my family.
The problems of liberal education, which have for some time
interested me academically, are now becoming of active con-
cern. My son has just entered kindergarten! I am ready to
Spring into action in the P.T.A., if questions such as the banning
of books should arise in my area or if I find in my children’s
hands certain of those watered down editions of Melville or
Dickens or Scott that purport to “make a text readable” by re-
ducing vocabulary and style to mediocrity.

Our family frequently enjoys music together under the leader-
ship of my wife, a professional. She is attempting to whip us
into shape as a quartet, with the three-year-old youngest carry-

[459 ]

ing the melody. Technically, these sessions are far removed from
that perfection Doc Davison used to get from us in his inspir-
ing rehearsals and concerts, but they are immensely satisfying
just the same.

Our vacation travel and activities have been restricted by the
youth of our children, but we have been more than repaid dur-
ing the past four summers by becoming intimately acquainted
with Cape Cod. |

In short, after twenty-five years away from Harvard, the
world of work and leisure continues to be as stimulating and as
rich in its satisfactions as it promised to be in 1933.

I DIDN’T complete work for my degree at Harvard, but de-
voted six years to work as a labor organizer, which was also
highly educational. Then back to school at the University of
New Hampshire where I got my S.B. in economics, did some
graduate work in history and wrote a history of the university.
Teaching jobs in a variety of colleges followed, interrupted by
further study at Columbia, and a year off to write my doctoral
dissertation, a social history of the shoemakers of my home
town, Lynn. I have high hopes of that being published soon by
the Harvard Press. My shoemakers’ book took me to Harvard
frequently, to work with manuscripts at the Baker Library (I
was delighted to be able to add a fine batch of union books to
their collection, only proper thanks for real red-carpet treat-
ment).

We find Baltimore a very pleasant place to live, especially the
Mt. Vernon Place section, which has overtones of Beacon Hill.
Besides teaching, research and writing, I find time for some
work with professional societies, including editing the very
young Bulletin of The Labor Historians, and for a very few

outside things, such as A.D.A., and the Baltimore Ethical So-

and recovering from final examinations, so I never expect to
attend one, unless I change my line of business (not likely).

MY last remaining guest at a gathering of friends on Commence-
ment Eve 1933 was a cocker spaniel of crimson coat who had
recently been model for a presentation sculpture of Shadow,
President Lowell’s frequent walking companion. Such has proved
prophetic of my principal preoccupation in the ensuing years and
a fully written annal would name a series of favorites to whom I
owe the deepest debts for my enrichment by their beauty,
camaraderie and continued devotion. Adopting English cockers
under the kennel prefix “Tragabigzando” in 1938, it was my great
good fortune to produce from my own bloodlines Tr. Boatswain,
champion and high winner in the United States and Canada. As
I write this, he lies at my feet happily and trustfully starting his
seventeenth year.

Submitted to the disposal of the Navy in 1942, my assignments
included the Naval Operating Base at Reykjavik, INSURV under
BuSHIPS at Bethlchem-Hingham (Massachusetts) Shipyards, and
Communications School at wartime Harvard. A welcome varia-

tion in the confines of Iceland was being detailed to supervision of
a group of twenty sentry dogs undertaken by the detachment
of U.S. Marines stationed at Hvalfjordur.

I have been a functionary of various dog clubs, serving as presi-
dent of the North Shore Kennel Club (Hamilton, Massachusetts)
in 1949, as similar official of the English Cocker Spaniel Club of
America in 1953 and as show chairman for the Framingham Dis-
trict Kennel Club in 1953 and 1954. More satisfaction has been
found in occasional activity over the last thirteen years as a breed
judge.

On the strength of notoriety as a dog-show official, I was once
part of a committee of three vacationing Americans invited to
choose an Apple Blossom Queen in Nova Scotia. In this type of
event one would not expect to attempt methods of manual exam-
ination accepted in determination of the Winners Bitch — in
probing for the desideratum of a sound “rear end,” nevertheless
it was belatedly brought to our attention that conversational
ability, table manners and general poise were the established
criteria on which to make our award. In fact, it gradually de-
veloped that the competition was offered under the august
sponsorship of the Daughters of the British Empire who, eschew-
ing any preliminary convivialities, expected the judges with each
change of course to change places at the banquet table in order to
afford ourselves a fair and equal sampling of the aspiring belles,
becoming increasingly gelid with fear of the ordeal and us aliens
in their midst. The gustatorial musical-chairs with its continuing
need of recaption of tableware was finally brought to a halt by
the Mayor’s formal speech of welcome and his proposal of the
toast to Her Majesty Elizabeth I. My glass, originally containing
water, was long since an empty one.

THIE depression summer of 1933 held no horrors of unemploy-
ment as we set sail from Hyannisport bound for Naples, Italy,
in Doctor Alex Forbes’s ninety-eight foot converted fishing
schooner. Stops in the Azores, Spain, and Majorca gave us a
taste for traveling in the informal manner that fitted in with a
school teacher’s life for the first three years. A cruise on the
same boat in the Aegean in 34 and a bicycle trip from the Hen-
ley Regatta through Scandinavia to the Berlin Olympics in 736
ended these three years of teaching, coaching and delightful
summers.

An insatiable curiosity to investigate the business world led
to the confines of State Street and then to the manufacturing
of silverware in Taunton. A family business was the last thought
in mind, but, being the fourth generation, and all sons-in-law,
scemed to provide a good opportunity in this 134-year-old com-
pany. A fine training program in the skill and crafts of silver-
smithing plus the opportunity to become well acquainted with
all of the cight or nine hundred personnel has proved invaluable.

Along came Pearl Harbor and the urge to get back to sea,
with a tinge of patriotic ambition. P.T. boats seemed a natural

[ 464 ]

2§TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

for one brought up on Buzzards Bay and cruising boats of all
sorts. The end of ’42 found us bound for New Guinea with
John D. Bulkeley of They Were Expendable fame and four
years of exciting and almost always pleasant Jap hunting
amongst the world’s magnificent scenery and cruising islands.
Ending up with a squadron of twelve of Uncle Sam’s smallest
and fightingest private yachts at the disposal of a mere lieutenant
was all that any seafaring man could ask.

V-J Day found us in Borneo where, for six weeks, no one
would believe the war was over. But, finally, it was home and
back to work in the “silver business.” Given a free hand, as
assistant to the president, it was a pleasure to study the varying
tastes of the great American public and to witness the growing
interest im things contemporary. By concentrating on the im-
portance of design and research in design fields, we have been
able to make steady progress within the industry in the last five
or six years. Having occupied the president’s chair since 1954,
there have been interesting outside assignments with the As-
sociated Industries of Massachusetts, with the Sterling Silver-
smiths Guild, and Jately with the National Association of Manu-
facturers. A trip abroad in 1956 to visit foreign factories and
designers brought many new ideas and acquaintances, not to
mention a wonderful vacation.

In the meantime, three children had arrived, a new house was
built, and a few other business relations established. The politi-
cal and artistic interests of the feminine side of the family, when
mixed with business and a love of the mountains and the sea-
shore, have provided a happy and wonderful mixture. Old age
is approaching but hasn’t made much headway as yet.

tributed by the Rand Corporation.

IN the effort to make a start on this, | come up with the dis-
covery that in tweny-five years of more or less adult living,
there may have been few noteworthy events, but in retrospect
things fall into phases. Herewith the phases:

I. 1933-40, graduate student phase. Three years of this were
spent at Berkeley, three at Chicago. My subject was anthro-
pology, my specialized interest American Indian languages. In
this field, by a proper choice of places to do original field re-
search, you can become an only living authority quicker than
in most. I got acquainted at first hand with a fair part of Cali-
fornia and some of Arizona, both very pleasant areas to be in
or near.

2. 1941-46, teaching phase. This was spent at Chicago, with
a short period in Washington during 1942-43. Having gotten a
permanent job, I got married and have stayed that way ever
since, This I attribute to my wife’s lack of imagination and ini-
tiative. The war turned me from American Indian to oriental
languages, and during the last two years of the war I was in
charge of a program of teaching spoken Japanese to Army and
Navy officers preparing for military government assignments.
Some of them made it. 1945-46 was a back-to-normal academic

[ 466 ]

year. Then I had an offer to go to work in the Japanese Occu-
pation. Thus began,

3. 1946-48, experiment with bureaucracy. A little over two
years in Japan, where my responsibility was to advise the Edu-
cation Division which proposals made by the Japanese govern-
ment or by private Japanese individuals and groups concerning
ways of making Japanese easier to read should be approved or
disapproved. My advice not consistently followed. From this
I acquired a considerable respect for bureaucracy and a con-
viction that I could not function effectively as a member of
one. My elder son was born during this period.

4- 1949 —, Rand and parental phase. Early in 1949 I joined
the Rand Corporation as a member of the Social Science Divi-
sion. Rand is a non-profit corporation chartered by the State of
California to conduct research to the benefit of the public wel-
fare and national security. My area of interest is Far Eastern
politics and international relations. This has been my work for
some time now, with occasional breaks for teaching. My second
son was born toward the end of 1949. Thereafter we acquired
a house and settled in for what looks like a pretty permanent
stay. The children account for a good deal of my time, and the
garden accounts for a good deal of what’s left over.

I have enjoyed travel, whether within the United States or
abroad, as an anthropologist, a social scientist, or just as a plain
tourist. Trips abroad, besides the two years with the Occupa-
tion, have been mostly in the Orient —three months in Japan
in 1953, six months in the Far East with the family in 1956-57,
and a month in the Mediterranean area on the way home from
this last trip, which left us looking forward to the next chance.

Twenty-five years after graduation, my condition is: Height,
about the same; weight, considerably increased; eyes, no change;
hair, beginning to convert to a shade more popular among the,
shall we say, mature; illusions, very noticeably eroded, except
for a few particularly stubborn ones.

ONE word describes my life and career over the past twenty-
five years— hectic. And only at long last have the repeated
pleas of the Class Report Committee to submit the story of my
life convinced me that twenty-five years have really passed.

My career began as a lowly control chemist in a pharmaceuti-
cal company in Boston. Since then I have held every possible
position in manufacturing management. An adventuresome spirit
and a reputation as both thinker and doer have kept me jumping
around in industry. You name it, and I have probably manu-
factured it with one or another of nine national companies I
have worked for during these past twenty-five years. It sure
has been fun —challenging and rewarding as far as a sense of
achievement is concerned, disrupting to the family with cross-
country moving, new schools for the kids at too frequent in-
tervals, etc.

Add to this some involvement in politics, multiple civic en-
deavors, and a stint of four years on a school board when we
did manage to stay about ten years in New Jersey Suburbia.
Then there were the varied activities of my wife and myself
with our four children, the Cubs, Brownies, etc., and now the
teen-age group, and you see the justification for saying things
have been and will probably remain hectic.

Getting back to my career, my specialty has been straighten-
ing out inefficient or high cost manufacturing or distribution

[ 468 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

operations. Solving the problems, which may be due to poor
labor relations, obsolete equipment, poor accounting controls,
etc., usually takes one or two hectic years at full speed. Once
done, along comes another company with the same challenge
and as my wonderful, patient, and understanding wife puts it
as we pack up to move 1,000 miles away, “Here we go again!”
We have achieved a wonderful family spirit through it all and
home has been where we found it, as long as we were all to-
gether.

Time has never permitted me many hobbies. The one I am
able to pursue most is hunting and I manage to get in a few days
of duck hunting and deer hunting each year. Regarding politi-
cal convictions, I am a die-hard Right Wing Republican of the
Senator Taft ilk, and intend to fuss and yell from the Right
with the hope that enough noise from that sector will eventually
have some long-lasting and beneficial effects in shaping the
future of the country, I am even so optimistic as to think it al-
ready is doing some good, and soon my brand of Republicanism
will be more in style than the present New Republicanism.

In conclusion, I don’t see how anyone could have had a
fuller, more interesting, more satisfying, or happier life than I.
I have been blessed with a wonderful wife and co-partner at my
side for twenty years, and I have four fine children, two teen-
ace boys trying to get to Harvard, and two younger daughters.
We all have good health and happiness. How could anyone ask
for anything more?

WHEN I received the clarion call from our secretary to pause

in my tracks and look back over the past twenty-five years to

‘appraise the Harvard influence on my life during that period,

I reacted with mixed emotions.

For those of us who were not “pickled in the brine” of Har-
vard tradition for the full course I sometimes wonder how much
of that which has been accomplished, either good or bad, re-
flects the Harvard influence. Yet, when I scrape off a few of
the barnacles that have accumulated in the twenty-five-year
period and take a second look, I am willing to credit those things
which seem worthwhile accomplishments to the influence for
good that may have brushed off on me as a result of a relatively
short stay at Harvard Engineering School.

After the death of my father and a rude awakening to the
realities of life, the stepping out into the world of earning a
living in the midst of a great depression was a hazardous under-
taking to say the least. Because of the counsel and guidance of
Professor Kennedy at the Harvard Engineering School, my
course was steered into the field of transportation. It proved
a wise decision since I have followed it in one form or another
ever since.

At about the same time the shadow of a redhead who also
had a kindly feeling toward the “Men of Harvard” crossed my
path and happily for me decided to become my wife. The net
result of all this was a reasonably steady progress upward in
the field that I had chosen and the establishment of a fine family

[471]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

of a daughter first and a son three years later, both of whom

have become our pride and joy.

Ten years as president of Consolidated Travel Bureaus, Inc.,
and six years as warehouse general manager of Campbell Motor
Parts, Inc., both in the Boston area, and ten years as an official
of the American Automobile Association, the last seven of which
have been in my present capacity as general manager of the
Automobile Club of Rhode Island, constitute my business his-
tory.

I am sure that those in the English Department at Harvard
in 1930 would roll over in their graves if they knew that, as a
part of my present duties, I serve as executive editor of the
American Motorist, a bi-monthly publication with a circulation
of 31,000.

Since the nature of my work involves a large percentage of
public relations my activities in the civic field have been rather
broad. The New England Council and its efforts to improve
the status of New England as a region have had my enthusiastic
support. Locally, in my adopted state of Rhode Island, an effort
to preserve and develop its historical heritage has proved both
interesting and fruitful. In my home town of East Greenwich,
Rhode Island, membership on the school committee for several
years has offered an opportunity to help get new schools built
and i improve the curriculum.

Having been a member of a - rather large and progressive
Methodist Church in Belmont, Massachusetts, when I came to
Rhode Island the smaller Methodist Church in East Greenwich
offered a challenge to help those already at work to raise funds
to restore a historical church edifice.

In retrospect, it appears that although my association with Har-
vard was almost transient in nature, it has been an influence for
good in wanting to do it credit and a hope that my son might
be exposed to the same privilege when he reaches college age.

PUBLICATIONS: Several articles on vascular surgery as co-author with R.R.
Linton, M.D., ’25.

FOLLOWING graduation and at considerable sacrifices on the
part of my family, I entered Harvard Medical School and re-
ceived my ALD. in 1938. I was fortunate to obtain a surgical in-
ternship and residency at the Massachusetts General Hospital
where I remained until June, 1942. Just after starting my intern-
ship, I married Eva Borrner, a graduate nurse at the Massachu-
setts General Hospital, whom I had met while I was a medical
student. This was and always will be the finest and most im-
portant thing that ever happened to me, During my training
at the hospital, we had many happy times together living in a
small apartment on Beacon Hill.

In August, 1942, I went on active duty as a lieutenant in the
Navy Medical Corps. Eva soon retired from regular nursing to
produce Irad, 3d, but during the war, she put in many hours of
work training nurses’ aides, She stayed in Waltham with my
family for the most part while I traveled. After an indoctrina-
tion period at the sub base in New London, Connecticut, I was

[ 473 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

sent to the Fleet Marine Force at New River, North Carolina,
later Camp Lejeune. Here, I became a battalion surgeon with
units which eventually joined others on the West Coast at Cam
Pendleton to form the Fourth Marine Division. Our Division
sailed from California in December, 1943, and we were overseas
until September, 1945. During this time, we participated in
the landings on Roi-Namfur, Saipan, Tinian and Iwo Jima. Be-
tween landings, we were fortunate to be based on the island of
Maui in the Hawaiian Islands.

On my return home I went into the private practice of sur-
gery as an associate of Dr. Robert R. Linton, Harvard Medical
School, ’25. There followed five years of wonderful surgical
training and experience. I also learned how expensive and in-
teresting the raising of a family could be. Peter was born in 1946
and the twins, Stephen and Erland, in 1948. In 1951, I estab-
lished my practice in Waltham, my home town, in partnership
with Dr. Joseph A. Holmes, ’31, Harvard Medical School, °35.
I am chief of surgery at Waltham, but have continued my clinic
and teaching work at the Massachusetts General Hospital during
the time.

In spite of the hours demanded by my kind of work, I have
been able to give some time to Boy Scout activities and to the
Boys’ Club in our city. Outside of these community activities,
my main personal interests have been directed toward spending
as much time as possible with my family and in doing a small
amount of very amateurish gardening around the home.

As we enter our T'wenty-fifth Reunion year, I believe we
are entitled to look back a bit. Whenever I do so, I always feel
that life has indeed been good to me.

MY twenticth-year report said life was settling into some kind

gone full circle.

crees, we somehow survived. Well, we survived and grew. But
today, I am living in Washington, working for the Federal Gov-
ernment and in a capacity that I hope stimulates and encourages
business. This change of geography and career occurred because,
in 1955,.1 had an attractive opportunity to sell the printing busi-
ness that I had been engaged in since 1933. It was a difficult de-
cision to make but, once determined upon, there have been no
regrets.

The few months of retirement after that were a wonderful
experience. My wife and I visited two places in Europe; Paris
and Italy. Returning to the United States, we then spent several
weeks sitting on top of a hill that we have owned for many years.
While “sitting,” I managed to plant seven thousand trees and en-
joy what we think is some of America’s most beautiful scenery.
This idyllic living was not to last. In September, 1956, urged on
by several publishing and printing organizations, we moved the
family to Washington.

I now serve as the director of the Printing and Publishing In-
dustries Division of the Business and Defense Services Adminis-
tration, U.S. Department of Commerce. This division serves the
newspaper, magazine and book publishers, as well as the com-
mercial printing industry, a ten-billion-dollar segment of the
country’s economy.

It has been a very exciting experience to live in the Nation’s
Capital, and I am grateful for the opportunity to be doing public
service. I have been able to get reacquainted with the family, to
live a somewhat less pressurized life, and to pursue some personal
interests.

My hobbies in recent years have centered around the develop-
ment of Hartwood Hill (elevation 2000 feet) in the Finger Lakes
region of New York State. But, when the weather is forbidding
and it is more fun to be inside looking out, my hobby is still, as it
was at Harvard, books — for reading, for admiring, and for col-
lecting. This hobby is supplemented, at the appropriate times,
with an interest in wines from France.

Politics? —The Hatch Act prevents me from a discussion of this
subject, but I think I may say without fear of persecution that I
have been a life member of the Republican Party.

My Family? How have they survived “life w ith Father”? My

[477]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

career and interests have been such that we have had the oppor-
tunity to be associated with the creative arts and the stimulating
people in this field. We have been able to spend sufficient time
in both rural and city living to develop a nice balance between the
bucolic and the urbane. I think both of these factors have been
helpful and healthy influences. The members of the family:
Karen Gail, a junior at Wellesley; Nancy Joan, an eighth grader
at National Cathedral School for Girls in Washington, D.C.; and
my wife, Joan Ruth, of Cleveland. We met in my senior year
when she was a junior at Simmons, and we were incorporated in
1934.

Looking back now for a Class Report of these past twenty-five
years, I am struck by the closeness of Harvard during these years.
It seemed only a short time after graduation that I became secre-
tary of the Harvard Club of Rochester, then vice-president in
1947, and president in 1949. During these years there was fre-
quent correspondence with the University and visitors from the
Faculty that brought news of Cambridge. The final year of my
presidency of the Harvard Club of Rochester was marked by the
visit of the Associated Harvard Clubs in May of 1954. This was
an event that was a year in preparation, and, when it occurred, it
was my great honor to introduce President Pusey and act as his
guide for his first appearance at an Associated Harvard Clubs
meeting.

One of the most pleasant and inspiring memories of the past
years was my association with George Parker Winship of Har-
vard, whom I first met and studied with in the Treasure Room
of Widener Library. He served until his death as the editor of a
series of books I published, and it should surprise no one that most
of the authors of this series had Harvard connections. Over the
years, business trips frequently took me to New York and Boston,
and I eventually became a member of the Harvard Clubs of those
cities.

Finally, when I arrived in Washington some twelve months ago,
the Harvard Club of Washington was preparing for the sixtieth
meeting of the Associated Harvard Clubs. Since I had been
through these proceedings three years previously in Rochester,
the local club treated me as an “elder statesman,” and so, in the

AS I look back on these past twenty-five years, 1 am impressed
with the way life happens around you and of how you are some-
how caught in its whirl. Sometimes I look at my wife at breakfast
and say to her, “What are all these strange people doing here?”
(I am referring to our four children, of course). The odd part is
that I half mean it! These same strangers, I hasten to add, are
quite delightful in their way and even though they have begun to
demand such inalienable rights as allowances, etc., I am very glad
that they did decide to come to live with us.

It has always seemed to me that my real education started
around June, 1933. It was at this time that I found that my vast,
accumulated store of wisdom and knowledge of the world was
found to be worth fifteen dollars per week in the open market
place. This was quite a blow! Particularly when I thought I was
worth at least twenty dollars!

Like most undergraduates, I had vowed eternal bachelorhood.
Fortunately for me, this notion did not last too long and in 1937,
and in one of my rare moments of good judgment, I married my
wife. Naturally I could not afford marriage but after all, who
could?

After various working experiences, which can best be classified
in that way, i.e. experiences, I began teaching school in the

[ 479 J

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

Andover public school system, Since I had majored in economics,
it was most natural that I should be a teacher of chemistry and

hysics. In the course of this teaching, I found to my surprise
that I was able to devise various original teaching devices. These
devices were eventually marketed to other schools throughout the
country.

At about this time, Mary and I counted noses and found that
three children had come on to the scene. This fact singularly in-
creased my interest in turning a few extra dollars. Why not turn
to developing ideas in other fields than teaching, I reasoned. . . .
a more lucrative field like, let us say, advertising (I think that I
had read in a book somewhere that advertising was lucrative).
Continuing on this line of reasoning, a color-shifting sign was
worked out. The only trouble was that I had no idea of what to
do with it. In the course of trying to see who would buy it, I
called at the Travelers Insurance Company and, to my amazement,
they liked it well enough to give me an order for a very sizeable
quantity. In the enthusiasm of selling, I forgot to tell them that I
was a school teacher and that I had no manufacturing facilities,
but now it was too late to say anything. There was only one
thing to do — give up teaching and go into manufacturing adver-
tising displays. And so this is how a school teacher for fourteen
years suddenly finds himself in the advertising business.

After a few years of being in business for myself, I now find
it simpler to do the selling for a much larger company that does

all of the manufacturing. And so—here I am, somehow a sur-
vivor of the past twenty-five years, very little, if any, wiser, but
still ready and willing to take a “whack” at the next twenty-five!

AFTER my brief sojourn at Harvard the first job I could ob-
tain with a paycheck was in the Reconstruction Finance Cor-
poration where I performed a lackluster stint lasting from 1932
until the end of 1934. I then accidentally obtained employment
with a small firm in Wall Street, no longer in existence, where I
contrived for several years to earn a fairly good living and to
enjoy my work which involved some short-range travel calling
upon banks and institutions in an effort to trade them in and out
of municipal bonds — then as now a profitable line of activity.
After becoming a member of a newly-organized firm I reached
a dead end in that business at the end of the thirties when I
switched, for no particular reason, to my present field of activity
in commercial banking which q have found an absorbing and
rewarding occupation.

I took the then popular “military leave of absence” from
1942 tO 1945, pretty much inclusive. After indoctrination at the
Naval Air Station, Quonset, housekeeping duties, etc., I attended
the Naval War College at Newport and was assigned to the
Pacific where I served the remainder of the war as flag secre-
tary to a carrier task-group commander.

Soon after my return to banking I accepted a foreign as-
signment in Brazil where I remained until 1948 when I entered
upon my present employment which has been congenial and
stimulating. In this job I have occasion to maintain frequent
contacts with our clients in South America where ] have formed
some fine friendships and have traveled also to these countries,
mainly Brazil, which has become my second home by adoption.

Though not spectacular, life has been far from dull in terms
of personal contacts and experience. Though notably deficient
in formal education I consider myself rather cultured, for no
reason that I am able to define. My political persuasion is to-
ward Republicanism of the conservative variety which now
seems relegated to a dodo-bird classification, but I still like it. I

time you get a day, or a week, or a month off, and the house
is a mixture of American labor-saving triumphs operated by
servants at six dollars a week. So far it looks like the happy
combination of a low salary with a high, and very entertaining,
standard of living.

occuPATION: Petroleum marketing; Division Real Estate Manager, Midwest
Division, Pure Oil Company. .

MEMBER OF: Harvard Club of Chicago.

HAVING reviewed my two previous efforts in the Fifteenth
and Twentieth Class Reports, I am now more than ever con-
vinced of the wisdom of the old “Silence is golden” maxim, and
so will try to keep this brief.

As I understand this sketch should reflect the accomplishment
of the past twenty-five years, I shall merely report that since
my brief stay in Cambridge I have followed a somewhat varied
business career, with the emphasis mainly on petroleum market-
ing, with the exception of the war years when I was in aircraft
production work. After leaving Cambridge I spent three years
in the South in the cotton business, then back to Philadelphia to
start in the oil business, first with the Pure Oil Company, fol-
lowed by Gulf Oil and Socony, and now for the last three and
one-half years, back with Pure Oil in Chicago. I find my work
interesting even though I haven’t yet struck oil in my back yard.

Family-wise, I live with my wife and two daughters in Win-
netka, on Lake Michigan, twenty miles north of Chicago. I
have another daughter living in the East who finds time to visit
us occasionally. Our suburban pattern of life doesn’t seem to
vary much from that of Philadelphia’s Main Line or New
York’s Rye-Greenwich-Darien area. We enjoy our friends and
are the world’s worst gardeners, which may or may not be rel-
evant! At the moment we are also enjoying a new addition to
the family, in the growing shape of an utterly delightful and
debonair Irish Setter pup, whose wanderings abroad keep me
broke bailing him out of the various local though sometimes

distant canine bastilles.

Politically, ’'m a middle-of-the-road type midwestern Republi-
can, who still enjoys reading the Sunday New York Times as an
antidote to the daily Chicago Tribune. Like all the rest of us, I
feel we are entering a very troubled era with the advent of
Sputnik, a time when I think the less important aspects of a party
label had best be forgotten in favor of a more unified front in
the interests of national survival.

Having said I’d be brief, I now find myself in danger of being

just the opposite and so will cut this off. Twenty-five years
sounds like a long time, but it’s frighteningly short when you
take time out for an inventory like this. Here’s hoping the next
twenty-five will slow up a bit and give us all a chance to mellow
a little with age.

Except for a honeymoon in Arizona and two weeks in Ber-

between Edgartown, on Martha’s Vineyard, and Dedham, Mas-
sachusetts, trying frantically to keep some semblance of order
in the middle of a juvenile three-ring circus. We have, in ad-
dition, worked together to create and manage the Concert Net-
work, a group of high-fidelity, FM, good-music stations licensed
to Boston, Providence, Hartford, and New York City. This en-
terprise, something of a departure from the field of Government
electronics, to which I devoted the previous fifteen years, absorbs
much of our time and has brought us new friends, interests and
pleasures. .In our last report to Concert Network stockholders,
we stated our aspirations in this way: “While we strive for the
right to world leadership by scientific attainments in the fields
of space travel and atomic power, let us remember the importance
of the cultural and spiritual contributions of our nation to civil-
ization. Let us dedicate at least a part of that scientific effort to
the communication of these truths to our countrymen, so that,
having acquired a knowledge of beauty and spiritual grace, we
may pass along to future generations a heritage rich with under-
standing and filled with the joy of life.”

Any classmate who is in the vicinity of our home, be it Edgar-
town or Dedham, or of our offices at 171 Newbury Street, Boston,
and 28 West 44th Street, New York City, will receive a warm
and cordial welcome. We are happy to count at least one class-
mate, St. John Smith, among our courageous stockholders.

THE Hatches are now established in an old house in Marble-

vacations come around we like to get away to the White Moun-
tains or Maine. I commute to Cambridge where I spend my
working hours doing design and development work in the En-
gineering Division of Arthur D. Little, Inc.

Looking back to the period starting in 1933; I spent an extra
year at Harvard taking engineering and business courses and
then went to work in a shipyard, For six years I did marine
engineering at the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Company in Quincy,
and lived in a pleasant bachelors’ establishment in Hinghan,
known as “Deadwood.” Then, motivated by a desire for broader
engineering experience, I changed to the General Electric Com-
pany’s Supercharger Department in Lynn. There I spent ten
interesting years (including the war years) working on turbo-
superchargers and jet engines. I lived with a congenial group
of bachelor engineers in Marblehead until 1946, when Barbara
and I were married. Then, ousted from Marblehead by the
housing shortage, we went to live in Stoneham. My change
from General Electric to Arthur D. Little, Inc., in 1951, was
prompted by the desire to work in a smaller concern and also a
local one, with assurance that my job would not some day
necessitate my leaving this area. Arthur D. Little, Inc., has
been a good company to be in. An amazing variety of engi-
neering projects keeps us on the go.

Our home has been in Marblehead again for the last six years.
The boys are in Scouting and I have been helping out in this
activity. We do some sailing and racing in our Town Class sail-
boat, which I have had for fifteen years and am now trying to
hold together with new fastenings for another season or two.

WHEN I graduated from Harvard I had no interest in the
Church. I wanted to be a writer or a teacher, and I spent three
restless years fluctuating between the two. I studied at Columbia
and got a Master’s degree in American history. I worked for
a year on Time and Fortune. | tried to write short stories and
failed. I was confused and unhappy.

I turned from journalism to teaching and began work toward
a Ph.D. at Harvard. I wanted to be of some use to people, es-
pecially young people, but I realized that I was not a scholar
and also that I wanted to work with all types of people, under-
privileged as well as privileged, old as well as young. For the
‘rst time I began thinking about the Church.

Finally, in the late summer of 1936, I made a sudden and dras-

[ 489 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

tic decision. I made application at the Union Theological
Seminary in New York and was accepted. I went there with
many doubts and with very thin theological beliefs. At Union
I came under the influence of men like Henry Sloane Coffin,
Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich. They gave me theological
convictions, and for the first time in a long while I began to
enjoy my work. I studied there two years, then went to the
Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge for my senior year.

I served as a curate for two years at Trimity Church in Bos-
ton and during this period was married to Helen Crocker Ad-
dison. In 1941 we went to our first parish, a small suburban
church in Arlington, Massachusetts. There our first daughter
was born, and there we experienced to the full the joys that the
parish ministry can bring.

In 1945 we left Arlington with many deep regrets and went
to Wilmington, Delaware, where I served as dean of the Cathe-
dral and where our second daughter was born. We liked the
parish and its people but we discovered that we were provincial
New Englanders, and we could never quite shake off our nos-
talgia for the wooded hills and busy valleys of New England.
When I was called to be rector of St. John’s Church in Water-
bury, Connecticut, we could not resist it. We resolved to spend
the rest of our lives in that part of the country that we loved
more than anywhere else.

St. John’s Church is a working class parish, large, unwieldy,
composed for the most part of people who work in the fac-
tories and brass mills of Waterbury. We spent three wonderful
years there and loved every minute of it. It was a high point
in our ministry.

In 1951 I was elected Suffragan Bishop of Connecticut, and
I served in this capacity until the end of 1957. My work took
me all over the State at all hours and in all seasons. I loved
Connecticut and developed a hobby of hiking in the hills around
Norfolk and Salisbury and studying wildlife, especially birds. I
became a strong conservationist, and wrote articles on this sub-
ject for various magazines.

Late in 1957 I was elected Bishop of Western Massachusetts,
and in January of 1958 1 began my new duties as head of that
diocese. It has been a long road since the days when I was

the direction it has taken and for the joys that it has brought to
my family and me.

AFTER graduation I spent a year at Oxford and another at the
University of Berlin. I was spared the struggle of trying to find
a job during the depression but had the harrowing experience of
observing the growth of Nazism at first hand. Returning to
America, I finished my graduate work at Columbia University,
which eventually granted me a Ph.D. Before that was finally
achieved, I acquired a wife, a son and a job at Williams, where
we spent seven very pleasant years, not counting an interrup-
tion for work with the American Broadcasting Station in
Europe, during 1944-45.

Shortly after the war we moved back to New York, where I
taught at Columbia for another seven years, edited a magazine
and began to publish work of my own. It was an arduous time,

[491 ]

but not unrewarding. Thanks to the generosity of the awarders
of Fulbright and Guggenheim fellowships, we were able to
spend considerable time in Europe, most of it in Vienna, a de-
lightful city even when it was surrounded by the Russian zone
of occupation.

In 1954 I joined the Harvard faculty and we, now a family of
four, found a pleasant old house in Cambridge. The University,
after an absence of twenty-one years, struck me as an enormous,
extraordinarily busy place, a bit hectic and all too highly or-
ganized. On the whole it seems a better institution than it was in
the period 1929-33; it is less class-conscious and far more rep-
resentative of the country as a whole. Our de facto co-education
seems to me an excellent thing, and my Harvard and Radcliffe
students are the best undergraduates I have taught anywhere.
In the fall of 1957, I accepted the “black spot” and became chair-
man of the Department of Germanics. It is a difficult but chal-
Ienging assignment.

Like my wife, who is fighting a running battle with the people
who have been trying to turn the Cambridge public schools
into their private domain, I am interested in politics. I am an
unrepentant (though not uncritical) Democrat, and like to re-
gard myself, in the words of The Male Animal, as an uncon-
fused liberal. Religion I do not discuss in public. My hobbies,
if one can call them that, are occasional theatre-going and very
occasional trips to Austria and Germany.

SEPTEMBER, 1957, brought word that I have been graduated
from college exactly a quarter of a century and that the time
has come to render an accounting! What a rude jolt to one who
has barely strayed from the Atlantic Coast, who has lost track,
and who has not reflected upon the dreams and bull sessions of
yesteryear.

The fall of ’29 added a new interpretation for the newly-
matriculated: B.C., before the crash, and A.D., after the depres-
sion. A new dollar meant a new horizon. The two cars per
family, the full dinnerpail joined the myths of a bygone era.
Yet I dreamed still of travel, a humble mansion, better mouse-
traps, and the Cinderella with whom I'd move with the best of
friends in the best of circles.

These castles in the air, tempered as I say by the shocks of
’29, were with me as I left the hallowed halls four years later.
A brief experience in the Witch City with raw leather was
unappealing. So, on to the teaching profession where the feel
of cured leather — the sheepskin — had a more familiar touch.
Marriage, then a son, then the war (no connection), a daughter,
and the war’s end found me still on the East Coast. And now,
ten years later on the verge of the Twenty-fifth, I still have no
story — earnings in four figures only!

Life, nevertheless, has been kind and generous, even thought-
ful. This educator’s life has brought the world of fact and
fancy, author and poet, mountain and valley, Orient and Occi-
dent, rich and poor to our very doorstep; our view, though local,
has included New England in its most brilliant dress as well as
In its most fearful moods (remember 1938, 1942, “Carol,”
“Hazel,” and her other deadly sisters?). The do-it-yourself
books, friendly apprentices (academic slave labor), building ex-
perts generously contributing their know-how — all enabled our
family to make the most of limited vacations (camp life and
administrative detail have always been part and parcel of the
summer months). Despite the last, we “converted” a Connecti-
cut jungle of two acres into a five-room house, a two-car garage,

a lawn and a garden.

[ 493 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

True, we've lost the Dodgers on Long Island and mighty Case
has struck out but, withal, I have the best darn Cinderella wife,
two remarkable children, and we still enjoy inverted travel, the
humble Connecticut mansion, and (to revert to the original) a
full dinnerpail and, believe it or not, two cars! A generous
neighbor presented our son with a ’29 DeSoto — rumble seat,
wire wheels, and all!

In conclusion, it only remains for me to point out that a
Harvard education is the answer. To insure that the ivied center
of freedom and independent thought is still “front and center,”
our son (Class of ’61) is now on hand to drink at this self-same
fountain.

HOW swiftly these twenty-five years have slipped away! Those

our own students receive as much from those of us who teach,
as we did from our professors?

[ 494 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

I continued after graduation at the Harvard Medical School
(M.D. 1937), and then spent three years at the Massachusetts
General Hospital in medicine and pediatrics before entering the
field of radiology. Hardly had 1 completed the training in X-ray
at the General, when World War II snapped me up for four
years of service as a radiologist. How I hoped to go overseas,
but had to remain in this country in general hospitals first. in
Staten Island, and later in Utica, New York. There was a short-
age of radiologists and I had the dubious distinction of being

kept in for several months after doctors in most categories were

being discharged. Altogether over 100,000 soldiers were X-

rayed by me and good experience was gained for future practice.

ft the age of thirty-four, I finally set up practice in the vicinity

‘of Boston. Are there any other professions where such a late

start is dictated by the long period of training?

The practice of radiology has been exactly the type of work
that I imagined doing back in college. There is a combination
of technical work and contact with patients. The healing art
is a wonderfully rewarding life’s work. Can there be any greater
satisfaction than curing a fellow man or all too rarely pulling
him back from death’s door to a useful life?

My practice centers in a moderately large private hospital in
Boston, with a private office in Dedham, and weekly consultant
work at four nearby Federal hospitals. Teaching takes up sev-
2ral hours a week at these hospitals and at medical school. Why
Jo we try to cram too much work into each day? And yet
-ach year adds more and more.

Twelve years ago I adopted an avocation which has proved to
ve inexhaustible and will require more than one lifetime to en-
ompass. Collecting ceramics chiefly from eighteenth-century
‘ngland culminating with the purchase of one of the fifteen
xtant numbered copies of the Portland Vase thrown by Josiah
Vedgwood in the 1790's. This was acquired in 1957, and even-
tally will go to a museum. The hobby started with the purchase
fa small blue jasper Wedgwood vase while in the army, and
om there on, curiosity has remained a constant goad. After
many years in this field, one feels sufficiently at home to lec-
re on ceramics and recently on all forms of the decorative
ts, in England and the Continent. My own collection is repre-

[ 495 ]

sentative of the period and is combined with eighteenth-cen
American furniture in my home in Wellesley. I should enjoy
visits from any of my classmates and their friends when they
are here in Boston at Reunion time or anytime.

MY first job after finishing Harvard Law School was, strangely
enough, developing aptitude tests for the Federal Security
Agency in Chicago. Then came World War II, during most of
which I was in India and China with the Air Transport Com-
mand. My duties were principally those of an information and
education officer and, as the need arose, I also served as counsel
in courts martial. ,

After the war I was for several years a special agent of the
F.B.I., variously stationed in Virginia, Washington, D.C., North
Carolina, Louisiana, Washington State and Pennsylvania.

In 1947 I married Lula Browne of West Palm Beach, Florida.
The next year I left the F.B.I. and became a civilian attorney in
the Office of the General Counsel of the Quartermaster General
of the Army. Soon after the outset of the Korean War I was
recalled to active duty with the Office of Special Investigations
of the Air Force in the Pentagon. I have remained in service,
was commissioned as a major in 1952, and for the last several
years have been a judge advocate. Besides the Pentagonal Puzzle
Palace, I was stationed in Denver and Tokyo, and am now back
in Washington.

Our little boy is barely old enough to come along and par-
ticipate in fishing trips. I have voted both Democratic and Re-
publican. My work in military justice is in a field which is con-
stantly developing and unfolding. As far as I can see, the mili-

tary services are doing an excellent job in this phase of their
mission,

THE road to architecture is a long one. I made it longer after
leaving Cambridge by (1) studying for a year at the Academie
National des Beaux Arts in Paris, (2) going to sea, (3) becoming
a naval architect and (4) working in a shipyard. Then just as I
had decided that architecture was really my meat (and I hoped
drink) after all, the Navy expressed an urgent desire for my
services and I went to sea in a brand new destroyer in early ’41.

I came out of the war a lieutenant commander and married.
In spite of the talk I had always heard of the instability of war-
time marriages, I saw my chance and I took it, thereby acquiring
not only a wife but a pretty eight-year-old stepdaughter named
Paula. We lived in Concord, Massachusetts, at the end of the
war, and I settled into a commuting life, having started below the
lowest rung of the professional ladder in my father’s office. I
was made a junior partner in 1953. Pamela was born in 1947 and
our son, Sandy, two years later. In spite of everything I can
suggest, Sandy seems to be set on being a cow-hand, a cop,
a marine, a railroad engineer or a naval officer, depending on
what TV program he has seen last. Pammie is simpler. She

[ sor ]

just wants to be a cow hand. I have an idea that they may be

vastly disappointed in the Great West when they finally visit it.

Meanwhile I had kept an interest in the Naval Reserve, inad-
vertently stranding the destroyer Livermore in 1949, during the
course of a cruise. I survived the subsequent Board of Inquiry
and was promoted to commander a year later. Apparently the
Livermore was past her usefulness and was getting very expen-
sive to maintain.

A few years ago an indulgent neighbor sold us a piece of
pastureland which bordered a pond and came complete with
cedars, juniper bushes and briars, and we decided to build a
house on it— ourselves. It took us four years, with the oc-
casional help of a retired Danish carpenter — seaman — circus
rider.

I’ve had precious little time for hobbies. However, I’ve
managed an occasional sail with a friend, have used the time
traveling to and from work on the train to write a novel, spend
several evenings a month on the Board of Appeals and others
with the U.S.N.R. Meanwhile Paula has married and has two
children of her own. I suppose this makes me a grandfather of
sorts, but every day I feel less like retiring to the inglenook. As
to the future, I am looking forward to being a full partner in our
firm and having a boat big enough to take us all cruising.

WE enjoy the life we live, and it does appear to be a we-life
rather than an I-life for both Muriel and me — and for our three
children, too. And it’s a parochial sort of life too. We've been
married just over ten years, we moved to Lynnfield in June,
1950. Lynnfield, though an old town, old even for New Eng-
land, has doubled in size in the past ten years, and is still grow-
ing. Almost as soon as we arrived in town we became interested
in the school system. I have served on the School Plant Plan-
ning Committee, am a member of the High School Building
Committee, and of the citizens advisory committee to the
School Committee. We are past presidents of the Lynnfield
Couples Club. We enjoy gardening, if making a lawn and
garden bed out of worn-out New England soil further damaged
by careless ground clearing can be called gardening. There is
a good swimming pool at the Salem Country Club and it has
been fun watching our daughters learn to outswim their parents;
we overlook Suntaug Lake and it has been fun watching our
youngsters learn to skate. Then there are PTA, Brownies, Gar-
den Club, and soon, for Chuck, Cub Scouts. We are both Re-

publicans, Muriel being a convert and a very substantial back-
Slider since 1956. We belong to the Roman Catholic Church —
and, oh yes, helped build (by serving on the church building
fund committee) a new church for our rapidly-growing town.

Except for the war years, 1942-1946, I have been in the milk
business since graduation. In 1949 I joined the Whiting Milk
Company as general sales manager and at the present time I am
vice-president in charge of market and industry relations. It’s
a very full job, quite varied in its aspects. The hours are in-
definitely long, but I truly enjoy it. One of the real thrills came
Jast June when Herlihy Brothers, my family business, and the
Whiting Milk Company were merged.

Those war years, how far away they seem! Mine began with
a return to Harvard in December, 1942, for five months as a
student at the Naval Communications School, followed by
twenty-seven months in Panama. While there I became head-
quarters communications officer, saw a lot of you as you came
through, did some detached duty in Central and South America,
learned a little Spanish, and developed a lasting interest in Cen-
tral America. My next orders were to the Pacific. I got as far
as Pearl Harbor where I met the returning and victorious Third
Fleet. My admiral relieved Admiral Halsey as commander of
the Third Fleet. I relieved Captain Harold Stassen as communi-
cations officer of the Third Fleet, and spent six months in San
Francisco helping to button up the Fleet before returning to
civilian life in May, 1946.

Travel has been sporadic since the war—a honeymoon in
the Maritimes, a trip to San Francisco, two to Chicago, con-
ventions in Atlantic City. As a sort of weekend project, we've
“done” the coast of Maine, vacationed on Cape Cod and in the
Vermont Green Mountains, and “got away” to New York City
as often as we could. Fritz, our boxer, is an old seven and a
half years, so we don’t walk as much as we should; our tele-
vision set is in the basement den, so we read quite a bit, mostly
detective novels and current biography. There is no more golf
and no more squash, just swimming and gardening. Sounds as
though we are growing old — guess we are.

ONE thing that has become clear to me in the years since college
is that we never stop learning. One thing I hope I’ve learned
(after some of my past efforts) is not to shoot my mouth off in
a class report. However—and perhaps this accounts for the
problem class secretaries have in getting these things in on time
— there seems to be an awesome finality about the Twenty-
fifth Report — something like picking out a cemetery plot. It
deserves a better-than-ordinary effort. That’s hard to reconcile
with a resolution to keep it simple.

A look at the original Class Album (to examine with horror
the picture that you plan on republishing) revealed something
I'd forgotten: “Intended vocation: foreign service.” Well, I
got that out of my system fast, although not quite in the way in-
tended. After a year on a depression-expedient job driving a
tank truck, I went to Latin America to help manufacture and
market proprietary drug products for a group of U.S. and
British firms having branch plants in several countries there.
Over the next six years this involved enough travel and foreign
residence to satisfy the original urge for “foreign service.” In
1940 I was back in the States, settled in Westchester County,
and editing a Spanish-language drug trade magazine published

[ 505 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

in New York for circulation in Latin America — something for
which my previous activities presumably qualified me.

This interlude was interrupted in July, 1941, by orders to
active duty in the Navy, which eventually lasted five and a half
years, all spent in the Pacific. I had good and not too arduous
duty — three years in various capacities on a submarine tender,
and two years as executive of an attack transport — plenty of
interesting activity and very little shooting.

After the war—and a lot of soul searching —I returned as
manager of the same drug trade magazine, now grown to two.
It didn’t work out quite as hoped for, and in 1950 I went to
General Foods Corporation to write and produce sales training
manuals and materials. Over a five-year period, this function
broadened out to include all phases of sales training and man-
power development. In 1955 I came to P. Ballantine & Sons,
brewers, as director of sales training —a job which involves a
widening range of activities under the general heading of man-
power and management development. And, to refer back to the
opening paragraph, believe me, I’m still learning.

As the vital statistics at the top indicate, ’ve had two marriages.
The first produced two daughters, both of whom are in Cali-
fornia with their mother. With my present wife, Edith, I inhabit
a semi-rural Fairfield County cottage which is intentionally small
(as befits our needs) so that maintenance chores will not interfere
with the year-round carpentry, painting and gadget-building
which go with operating my power cruiser on Long Island Sound
for a few short months each year. This also has something to do
with my stubborn adherence to one of the longest daily commutes
on record — sixty-two miles each way to Newark, New Jersey.
This trek, in turn, tends somewhat to limit community activities
and civic virtue.

Political convictions, etc.? Middle-of-the road Republican,
deeply concerned about our position in the world and, in the face
of a long-term tide that seems to be running against us, about the
prospects for survival of the culture and environment that have
made possible an institution such as Harvard and what it stands for.

AT first glance, a quarter of a century seems a considerable time
to sum up in a few brief autobiographical paragraphs. Yet, con-
fronted with the sudden question, “What have you been up to?”
I can do little more than shrug the answer, “Oh, nothing much.”

I suppose part of the trouble lies in the fact that the purely
arbitrary climaxes we single out for notice and celebration — the
strategic birthdays, the anniversaries, the class reunions — are
seldom dramatically timed to match the real denouements of our
lives. Like the gold watches passed out to faithful employees after
fifty years of invariably punctual service, they come with a built-
in anticlimax. Which one of us has discovered that first tell-tale
grey hair precisely on the morning of his fortieth birthday? I
have now been out of college for twenty-five years. Last year
it was twenty-four. Next year it will be twenty-six. I wonder if
there is any great difference.

The truth is that, beyond a faint sense of surprise at the quick
passage of time engendered by its presence, my twenty-fifth
reunion year seems to me quite insignificant compared to the im-
portant incidents, many of them now forgotten, of the individual
years that have passed. In 1958, some of the vital facts of my life
are that my daughter is a freshman at Smith, that my son is on his
way to becoming a fifth-former at Westminster, that each of them
is healthy, well-fed, decently clothed, reasonably happy and well-
liked, that a future beckons to them as it still does to their parents,
and that they at least become constantly better equipped to face
it.

[ 507 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

I suppose that all of us like to think of ourselves, our wives and

our children as very special individuals, and of our lives as unique
and set apart from those of the common herd. In the case of the
Hewletts, this is, of course, not mere fancy but cold, hard, ob-
jective fact. Still, it is just possible that when the busybodies of
measurement, the sociologists, the psychometrists, the economists
and heaven knows who all, eventually get down to sifting and
sorting the statistics of the Class of 1933, the Hewletts, like many
others, will be happily lost in those comfortable and non-com-
mittal areas labeled “median,” “average,” and “normal.” We have
had our climaxes, great and small, collective and individual —
desperate crises encountered and surmounted in the paying off of
a note, the negotiation of a mortgage, recovery from mass measles,
the necessity of buying a new party dress at income tax time, or
the celebration of a birthday when the family dog has just eaten
all the icing and two of the candles off the festival cake — but
they have passed and blended in memory with long vistas of
relative calm to give a smooth perspective to the passing years.
There are many more, I feel sure, just around the corner, but
maybe these too will pass.

Over the years, the breathless sense of urgency that once
prompted me to rush headlong from the stage of the Hasty
Pudding theatre into the arms of an utterly indifferent Broad-
way — without even a pause for any such nonsense as divisional
exams — has given way to what I hope is a quieter sense of life’s
dramatic values. Much of what I intended to do then is still un-
done. Most of it now seems quite unimportant. What still appears
to be good is good enough to wait its proper turn. Every calendar
and every letter from your busy committee tells me daily that I
have less and less time at my disposal, yet ironically the immediate
need for hurry seems constantly to recede. The sometimes twisted
road that has led me from the vicarious excitement of a backstage
world of make-believe in show business to a comparatively com-
fortable aisle seat in the auditorium of magazine journalism has
been an education far more exacting and far more real to me
than the one I pursued in our pleasantly escapist years at Harvard.
It has offered no neatly timed commencements or reunions, Its
report cards have been issued in the form of occasional dark dis-
couragements and constant deep satisfactions in lessons learned

[ 508 |

and prizes reaped. But its most distinctive quality is that it goes
on and on in one long, rewarding semester. Caught here in mid-
term, I find it difficult to make any comment more valid than that
I find it all thoroughly interesting and enjoyable. Maybe if you
are able to reach me again twenty-five years after my final gradua-
tion, I shall be able to do better.

For the moment, I prefer to take my last twenty-five years for
granted and look ahead into a future which refuses to seem as
black as many of those around me would have me believe. Re-
membering the supposed hopelessness of the world into which
1933 was graduated, I have little time for those who look today
for the same dark presentiments in the world that will belong to
my children. Just as they are patently better than we, so I think
their world can and probably will be better than ours. I am
frankly bored and tired with those of our generation who use
their expensively acquired education only as an excuse to wag a
minatory forefinger at the young and rumble that all is lost. I
don’t believe that every new discovery of science will necessarily
be put to evil use. I strongly doubt that today’s youth will accept
every challenge as an ineluctable defeat. I don’t imagine that the
world’s present problems will be solved for good and all over-
night, nor do I think that there will not be many more problems
waiting when these are solved, but what impatience I have left
is reserved almost exclusively for those whose own impatience
leads them to the desperate belief that no solution is good unless
it be quick, pat and easy. It is more than likely that these words
leave me wide open to the charge, so fashionable in these restless
days, of complacency. I would gladly plead guilty if the charge
were reduced to one of relative contentment, compounded by
confidence and a decent concern.

JUST before graduation in 1933 I nailed down a summer job with
a travel company and went abroad for them as a business assistant.
There was no pay but that was par for the course in 1933, and the
summer was rich in experience. The future of the travel business
was a bit obscure at that time, and upon my return to this country
in the fall a job opened up with Messrs. Benton and Bowles of
advertising fame, who later became elected a senator and governor
respectively, Working in the firm of these two Yale gentlemen
surprisingly enough proved an invaluable experience, doing every-
thing from running off script on the old mimeograph machine for
Cap’n Henry’s “Show Boat” with Lanny Ross (more Yale talent),
to proofreading, mechanical production, and traffic work.

However, in the fall of 1935 another opportunity arose in the
transportation field, which has always been my great interest, and
for two dollars a week less I decided to leave the realm of Sal
Hepatica and Hellman’s Mayonnaise and go into the business of
marine shipping in Philadelphia. I have been with my present firm
since that time, have seen the many ups and downs of this interest-
ing business before, during, and after the war years, and have
watched the Port of Philadelphia grow. As soon as Britain was
at war in 1939 we were in it too and went to work as agents for
the War Shipping Administration in the handling of strategic
materials.

Very fortunately I found t time to marry, and there was no
problem at all in having our first child, a beautiful blonde daughter,
nine months later.

The years have rolled by all too quickly and our business has
become more and more diversified. I was able to make several
trips abroad before the war, and then more recently, with my

[ 510 ]

travel-loving wife, have visited Panama and South America by
freighter and had one very exciting trip to Spain and Italy. Busi-
ness occasionally takes me away from home, and I have had to go
as far as Turkey in one instance.

At home we are active in the Episcopal Church, and enjoy ice
skating at our new club rink nearby. I am also old enough now to
take up golf and still enjoy swimming, hiking, and occasionally
tennis. My son John (13) loves riflery, and target practice is an-
other pleasant pastime, although our range in the cellar is not
always appreciated by other members of the household. Daughter
Charlotte (16) would rather figure skate than eat and that’s saying
something because she loves to eat. As a family group we have
enjoyed trips to Maine and Florida.

Frankly, business takes most of my time, and my family has
always put up with late meal hours, but they are all almost used
to it now. My vote has always been Republican, and I would
never enjoy the fellowship of the Union League of Philadelphia
if I had other tendencies.

We are presently at a loss to know how to work out Charlotte’s
graduation from school with the Twenty-fifth Reunion, as both
come during the same week. It appears I shall have to get special
commuter tickets on Eastern Air Lines, or do a great deal of
driving on the turnpikes.

It seems to me it would be best to leave room for the next
autobiography. I’ve said enough, but add just one more thought.
I believe every Harvard man should be proud to back the program
that has been proposed by President Pusey to attract the best
possible talent to the educational field for instruction and research
to retain our country’s leadership in the continued search for
knowledge and the truth.

ON January 1, 1957, I resigned as chief of the General Litigation

partner in a Chicago law firm. With the exception of the war
years, when I was in the Navy as an air combat intelligence officer
(1943-1945), I had been with the Department of Justice since
1938. During those years, defending and prosecuting civil cases
on behalf of the United States provided an active and exciting pro-
fessional life, Washington an attractive and comfortable setting.
To leave was not easy for my family or for me.

However, with each month that passes, I find that the decision,
hard as it was to make, couldn’t have been a better one. The
change of scene and role provided stimulus and challenge. I find
that private practice, handling cases for individual clients, has even
more excitement than government practice and provides con-
tinuing satisfaction.

With less than a year on the shores of Lake Michigan, our
family is adjusting to its new life with surprising enthusiasm.
Whatever Potomac fever remained in my system has rapidly dis-
appeared with the new invigorating and satisfying life of Chicago.
Between Sputniks, I look to the future with hope and interest.

ALTHOUGH, at Harvard, while cubbing for the Crimson, I
thought I might go into the publishing business, I am still in the
engineering career I entered into right after graduation, which is
working in a small enterprise in what is now known as the elec-
tronics industry, although when I graduated, it was simply called
electrical. I joined my father in his business shortly after gradua-
tion and found myself in a rather old-fashioned, one-man cor-
poration having about fifty employees and making electrical ap-
paratus, in which there was and still is a large percentage of handi-
craft work. I have had a multitude of jobs and duties which you
have to have in a small business, and I started at the bottom, in the
machine shop, then draftsman, time-study man, cost accountant,
catalog and advertising writer, and on up to factory manager. -
Now, although I carry the title of “President,” I am more of a
chief design engineering supervisor and a sales engineer. The
ramifications of the electronics industry during the past few
decades are well-known, and my career has had its share of turbu-
lence and excitement.

I have often had occasion to recall the advice given us at Com-
mencement that graduation does not necessarily mean that you
know anything, because your education has only just begun.
Many times, when trying to develop a new idea in the wildly
gyrating field of electronics, and finding my designs almost
“scooped” by others, I have thought that perhaps my scientific
diploma should be regarded as only a hunting license; you try to
develop brand new ideas, and so many become duds! In spite of
some frustration, I have managed to get a few successful ideas into
production and to try out on the public some new electronic
devices. Chances are your car battery, or television, might have
been tested using one of these gadgets.

A RESUME of one’s life to include one’s convictions, points of
view and basic beliefs is impossible. Writers have been trying to
tcll such a story for years; few come close. Our college generation
has lived through national and world events not experienced by
others; we continue on in a world unstable and unpredictable.
Harvard has helped us: a desire for truth, a respect for integrity,
a faith in the future and a joy in living — these things remain.

My personal, factual report is simple enough. From the Grad-
uate School of Education, I quickly passed through teaching in
high schools, directing a summer camp, administrating schools and
thence to serving the U.S. Navy. World War II I was fortunate
to survive with both myself and family intact. I served as com-
manding officer of U.S.S. PC-1077, U.S.S. Price (DE-332), and
U.S.S. Rogers Blood (APD-115) in the various theatres of war.
After the war, I became a “regular” officer in the Navy and sub-
sequently commanded the U.S.S. Joseph E. Campbell (APD-49)
and the destroyer, U.S.S. Perry (DD-844). During the Korean
mess I spent a year away from home in Japan — Japan is pictur-
esque and fine, but that year was nine!

I returned to the States and to Washington, D.C., to a challeng-
ing and stimulating position working for the chief of Navy per-
sonnel, Vice Admiral J. L. Holloway, Jr., as liaison officer with
Congress. I am now commander, destroyer Division TWO
FORTY TWO, and we are at present moving about with the

Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean doing our bit to keep the world
more stable.

My family! From the time of my marriage to Doris Elizabeth
Larcom (sister of Classmate Cliff Larcom) in the Memorial Chapel
in 1936, my wife and children have been my joy and pride. For
my wife, there are no words to describe our rapport and the sup-
port she’s given an ordinary guy. The oldest child, Joyce, is a
student at William and Mary, a good looking red-head. The
second, Carolee, is a heart-breaker and finishes high school in
Newport’s ultra modern school this year. The youngest (eleven),
Paul Worthen, is the red-headed, freckled face boy that everyone
wants.

Hobbies? For physical ‘exercise I play golf a few times a year
and watch TV. I occasionally am bitten by the camera bug but
the fever soon passes. The beach, swimming and barbecues are
tops!

nN As the years go by, I find it difficult to accept Ivy League foot-
ball and Harvard’s, in particular. I can rationalize the situation
and almost quite convince myself, but sometimes I find the defeats
hard to stomach. Fortunately, I had a tour of duty at the Naval
Academy, and I find myself a strong rooter for the Navy team. |
I like to think that rooting for this team which always has a
chance to win keeps me young in spirit. But, Navy vs. Harvard —
of course, I pick HARVARD!

NOT long ago the Twenty-fifth Anniversary was a topic for the
distant future and now that it is here I can see no reason for
writing it especially as I] was such a late comer to Harvard. Sick-
ness in: my youth caused me to have a highly irregular education
and it is a wonder I graduated at all. In order to comply with
the request fora report, [ read the Twentieth Anniversary Report
and I must admit that I found it quite interesting and revealing.
Since my last report I have established by own architectural de-
signing office with my better half as my right-hand man and to-
gether we have had a most successful three years creating an
enjoyable business, Most of my work is here in Marin County,
thereby solving the commute problem, and I am becoming a
renovation expert and do any kind of work from dog-houses to
palaces.

My greatest happiness and chief reason for existing is my family
which consists of a long-suffering and charming wife and three
children — two sons and a daughter. To raise these children is a
full-time job; often I have remarked to their Mother that the
young have changed since my day. Her retort usually is that I
have a phenomenally short memory. I am fortunate in that the
entire family love sports which vary from hiking, swimming,
skating and tennis; the last is our chief recreation with my wife
and daughter earning top honors, though I try to assert myself.

Since I came to California eleven years ago, my travels have
been restricted. However, in my youth, I was able to go to
Europe several times. Now my trips are confined to the West
Coast. The Olympic Peninsula, the Cascade Range, the Sierra
and the Redwoods in Humboldt County are most spectacular to
behold. My hopes are to travel once again when the children are
estal, lished: with my wife I shall set forth to conquer the world

before retiring to an enchanting seacoast town called Bolinas
where the hills meet the sea.

As far hobbies, my real one is music, the love of which I have
inherited from my composer Father. Tam a typical shoemaker’s
son, whe in this case can’t read a note, yet [am familiar with all

[518]

2§TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

kinds of music thanks to FM radio and a growing collection of
records. I indulge also in collecting stamps with the result that
one corner of my drafting room is in a perpetual mess.

I should like to be a social genius but other members of my
family are more endowed. Nevertheless, I am a strong Republican
in an area dominated by strong Democrats who have little effect
on me. I am a devout Episcopalian, with my elder son confirmed,
my daughter going to be in the spring and the third I hope will
be; they are all baptized in the church of my faith where I have
taught the fifth grade of Sunday School for four years. I have
been a member of the Harvard Scholarship Committee for the last
two years, and have spent several most profitable Saturdays inter-
viewing the prospective freshmen. I am very much impressed

how talented and gifted these young men are.

Now that I present my literary pain, there is more of it than I
realized but the Class Committee may add, edit or omit any of it
with my blessing. If I live to write the Fiftieth, I shall be more
brief, but good luck to our Class of 1933.

Naval Reserve — first as communications officer and later as a
navigator. The entire time I had sea duty. The first year I was
on Atlantic and Mediterranean convoys aboard various cargo
ships and tankers. The summer of 1943 brought me to the in-

AFTER graduation from law school I started the practice of law
and participated in various civic activities. I served as police
judge in River Hills, a suburb of Milwaukee, for four years, which
required some evening court sessions each month. I served as an
officer and a director of various groups such as the Milwaukee
Junior Chamber of Commerce, Town Hall of Milwaukee, Re-
publican Club of Wisconsin, and on various speakers’ bureaus
for Community Fund, Red Cross, etc. In 1941 I went on active
duty as a reserve officer. I had been active in Reserve Officer
activities and associations and attended several summer training
sessions. In the Army I was transferred to the Judge Advocate
General’s Department in which I served until the end of 1945
when I was relieved from active duty as a lieutenant colonel. |
practised law for a year and then entered government service.

Since the war, my outside activities have been confined to
church work and participating in activities with my elder son. I
was president of the Lake Park Lutheran Church a couple of years
ago. My elder son and I have been active in Indian Guides, a
Y.M.C.A. activity. My wife and I have also been active in

HARVARDY’S stubborn insistence that I am an alumnus might
merit an otherwise presumptive autobiography for the Report.
At the time of Harvard entry, the only purpose known to me was
to participate in athletics. I wasn’t a demon at anything, but
rowing seemed like a body-builder, No previous experience
helped me to seven quick crabs on my maiden voyage in the 150-
pound freshman shell but I felt my little muscles grow and
tenaciously clung to an oar — on oath to coach that I would stick
exclusively. A few days later the freshman basketball coach
jerked me from a game which I was surely starring and introduced
me to a spectator who looked a lot like a crew coach. I was
forthwith retired from both activities. This unbiased suggestion
of expendability thoroughly shattered an already touchy ego.
The dean and I understood each other like real gentlemen when
I departed at the end of my first and last year.

Then I decided to be a famous writer and took off for a some-
what less rigorous climate —the University of North Carolina.
Badly in need of enrollment, Chapel Hill enthusiastically pocketed
Dad’s non-resident remittance and let me wend a merry way.
Being a future famous writer, I joined a creative writing class with
a half-dozen others under the reason for my having chosen Chapel
Hill —a truly masterful articulate named Phillips Russell. We
had “classes” every once in a while — deep into nights — at his
home — leaving the days and lots of nights free. Maybe I took a
couple of other classes. Again, once in a while, I was an editor of
the school literary magazine. That way I could get stuff in print.
My creations were so deep that even Mr. Russell thought they
must be pretty wonderful, but they hit the real low when even I
couldn’t get the drift.

This harsh preparation for the full life continued a couple of
years, until the summer of 1932, when one day I whined piteously
about the dough Dad gave me to entertain the girl Tloved. Mother
told me a few facts — especially of life in 1932. I quit college to

[ 522]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

launch my writing career. My stuff was so creative that even the
leading publishers couldn’t get with it. That fall I sold some soap
on commission — to my mother’s friends. It had wood splinters
in it. One of Dad’s very closest friends gave me a job in his
stationery outfit, over paid me sixteen dollars a week, fired me in
a little while.

I told my old prep school in Milwaukee how badly I was needed
as publicity manager — got cosy with the local society editors —
wrote what I wanted to in monthly Parent-Faculty and Alumni
Bulletins — overcharged the school fifty dollars a month.

My future-father-in-law, three future brothers-in-law, an uncle
and a cousin were all architects of stature in Milwaukee, so in
1933 I started publishing a monthly magazine called The Wisconsin
Architect. 1 rewrote knowing stuff borrowed from Architectural
Forum, American Architect etc., and blackmailed the starving
construction industry into advertising in this gospel, so that I
could marry the girl I loved. My masterpiece was a convention
issue with about eighty pages of advertising, a couple of pages of
convention schedule and one and a half pages sort of blank.

In 1935 I married the girl I loved — an otherwise well-balanced
person. To supplement the yield from the school hoax and The
Wisconsin Architect swindle, I joined the sales staff of a real
estate firm owned by another of Dad's very close friends, From
1935 to 1938, I rented two or three little apartments and one
small house to very close friends.

In 1938, the Travelers Insurance Company of Hartford, Con-
necticut, was so desperate for staff man-power in the Milwaukee
branch office that I felt impelled to accept an offer to work for
practically nothing in their Life, Accident and Group Department.
Without much reluctance, I dumped the three other “activities.”

I guess it was in 1942 I first tried to get a commission in the
Navy. Patriotism came second after a life-long yearning to wear
a uniform. I still love Jead soldiers. The Navy was stuffy about
my not owning a college degree and made some pretty nasty
suggestions about the Army. In 1943, Uncle greeted me. Be-
cause of a managerial position and three children, somebody with
vast wisdom recommended that I apply for one of those extremely
dubious occupational deferments. But knowing that an irrespon-
sible girl could handle my high position at least as efficiently —

[ 523 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

and mentally admiring myself in any old uniform — I forsook my
loved ones and steamed off to a desolation called “Camp Crowder.”

In an amazingly long time for just a few weeks, that loathsome
sergeant had scaled me down 44 pounds and about eight waist
inches, some in the field, much on the mess-hall floor, more in the
latrine. About the end of Basic, someone in Washington flew off
his swivel and the C.O. at Crowder got a letter requesting my
discharge from the Army so that I could accept a commission as
Lt. (j.g.) U.S.N.R. Though somewhat disappointed at losing an
opportunity to shoot the sergeant in the back, I accepted the
promise of better eating for the girl I loved and the children.

After a rest-cure, Navy Indoctrination School at Tucson, where
what I learned was that I was a “gentleman,” I talked the place-
ment people into Armed Guard by insisting that I was poor at
taking orders and a helluva fine shot. Then I sculled around the
Pacific in a couple of Liberty ships and a Victory for approxi-
mately 78 years. Only real troubles were with S.P.’s and merchant
skippers.

Back in Milwaukee with the girl I loved and kids, Christmas
1945, I started my own insurance agency in January, 1946. By
this time — even without a college degree—I have learned so
much that it comes easy to say, “I’m the best damn insurance man.”
And yet, the big reason I’m interested in sharing this knowledge
that I’m the best damn insurance man is so that I can get for the
children the education they deserve because they want it — for the
girl I love what she wants because she deserves it — for myself a
glut of hunting and fishing because it’s what I’m best at.

2§TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

HARVARD BROTHERS: Robert Crossett Holcombe, ’37; Richard Maynard Hol-
combe, "43.

occupaTion: Engineer; development engineering for electromagnetic devices,

OFFICES HELD: Science master, Brooks School, North Andover, Massachu-
Setts, 1933-41, 1947-51; member, Town Finance Committee, North An-
dover, 1948-51.

MEMBER OF: American Alpine Club; Milton-Hoosic Club; American As-
sociation of Electrical Engineers, Duxbury Yacht Club.

MY first effort after graduation was to return to summer school
for a little belated preparation for teaching, and by September I
considered myself one of the lucky few who were gainfully em-
ployed. Supervising meals and a dormitory, teaching classes and
coaching sports from September to June is arduous, but has the
compensation of leaving the summer free, and in June I was off to
Alaska with Brad Washburn, a summer, a land and friends never
to be forgotten.

By 1936 I had acquired a slight degree of confidence in being
able to keep ahead of the boys, and I found a girl who was willing
to share my lot. Furthermore she liked skiing and cruising as
well as I did and we have been enjoying them ever since except for
the obvious interruptions. In 1939 came the long awaited sab-
batical year which was spent in California soaking up a judicious
mixture of astrophysics and flying. Two wars and four children
later we still spend every free moment on the water in the summer
and in the mountains in the winter.

By the spring of 1942, I was much too restless to teach, and
proceeded to blunder into a branch of engineering for which I
was obviously unqualified (sensitive relays and control circuits),
but I finally concluded that nearly everyone else was too. Until
1946 the family grew and I was active in the State Guard and the
Civil Air Patrol. It is hard to express the feeling that comes from
trying to help a hundred eager boys try to get better prepared
for the Air Force. Likewise, three years spent on the Town Ad-
visory Board really give one a faith in democratic government
and one realizes that most people are truly sincere most of the
time and that the system will fumble through to preserve a way
of life that is very wonderful.

Then the war and all company business terminated, and so back
to the teaching. However, a family in a boys’ boarding school

[ 525 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

presents problems which are aggravated by the realization that in
many schools the janitor seems to be judged more valuable than
most of the teachers, In 1951, I seized the opportunity to go back
to the engineering.

After the war, short vacations permitted a number of trips com-
bining flying to and climbing in the Canadian Rockies, the Tetons

. and the Wind River Range in Wyoming. More recently, cruising
with the family has become practical to such places as the Bras
d’Or Lakes of Cape Breton Island and up the St. John River of
New Brunswick.

As for the engineering, it has surprisingly much in common
with teaching science; both are more dependent on understanding
the people involved than merely knowing the rules or the book.
If the pressure to train scientists increases it behooves us all to see
that the emphasis is on the breadth and thoroughness of education
rather than on the intense concentrated technical training.

NINETEEN THIRTY-THREE turned out to be one of the
best years of my life up to that date, since first, I had managed by
guess or by God, to graduate in the field I liked, engineering
sciences; second, although I was accepted to the Graduate School
of Architecture, it was fairly obvious I could not attend, already
owing Harvard some $2500.00 in loans, with no visible means of

[ 526 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

support, and I got a job! Concluding a long, non-stop sentence I
shall outline my life in more concise phrases.

The job was as clerk in the Boston sales office of Jones &
Laughlin Steel Corporation; the salary $12.50 a week; the future,
a promise of sales work in structural and reinforced concrete
buildings as yet not even in blueprint form. The future turned
out to be in the sale of pipe and tubular products, which even-
tually led to my advancement to the oil fields of Wyoming and
Montana.

However, I am getting ahead of myself. On August 20, 1938,
I was married to Constance Wigglesworth in Harvard, Massachu-
setts. We lived in Cambridge, where she taught art at the Cam-
bridge, now Lesley-Ellis School. Business called us to Denver,
Colorado, and at Christmas time of 1939, having arrived in Denver
on a Friday, we rented a nice house for $62.50 a month on Satur-
day. We went skiing on the Continental Divide on Sunday and
practically every available weekend thereafter for the next four
years.

These were wonderful years, We built a beautiful modern
house at the foot of the Rockies, had two children and made
many friends. Work was steel, but Denver and the Rocky
Mountain West didn’t know there was a war on. What little con-
tribution I may have made to the war effort can be catalogued in
the part that the steel fabricators in that area played in producing
war goods. I worked hard persuading them to convert and I have
a modest pride in the fact that at least I was a contributing factor
to the planning and effort that produced 289 LCT’s in Denver,
Colorado, in 1943, one mile above sea level!

The West ended abruptly with an offer from the company to
manage a new office to be opened in New Haven, Connecticut.
Having moved the family lock stock and spent a year in New
York City waiting for the company to proceéd as planned, my
patience with “BIG” business blew, and when an opportunity to
go into the manufacture of specialty tubing presented itself, I
took the bull by the horns and went.

For the past eleven years I have been a principal in a small] tube
mill making items of size and quality that no integrated steel mill
will or can make. For example, steel tubes into which a human
hair would just enter, made to tolerances measured in tenths of a

[ 527]

thousandth of an inch. I have been very happy notwithstanding
the vicissitudes that every small businessman finds haunting his
every move. I have learned much about production, finance, cost-
accounting, the hard way, because in a small operation there is no
other.

My younger son, Jock, was born here in Cambridge and my
good wife has picked up where she left off in her career of teach-
ing art. She is now head of the Art Department at Browne and
Nichols School.

We have converted an old barn in Manchester, Massachusetts,
for our summer quarters and the harbor houses our pride and joy,
Toccata, an ancient but honorable yawl which nobly bears us to
Maine and back for our two-week vacation each summer.

Presently, Mike is seventeen, Isabella, fifteen, Jock, ten, and
education is our most important product, and I suppose ours too
goes on. May we all benefit.

MY medical career started when we opened the office for general
practice in Amherst, Massachusetts, August 1, 1938. My wife,
being a registered nurse, has worked in the office with me except
for a few weks when the children were born. When Mary Louise
was six weeks old I was called into active duty and stationed first

[ 528 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

with the Air Force at Grenier Field, New Hampshire, then Drew

Field, Florida, My family went with me after closing the office

and our home in Amherst. In April, 1944, I was transferred to the

Army and sent to Fort Benning, Georgia. In April, 1945, as a

captain, I went with a Hospital Unit to Saipan, getting my dis-

charge in February, 1946. I opened my office again for general

practice and also worked part-time for two years at the V.A.

Hospital in Northampton. I have been very interested in allergy

and devote a part of my time to that specialty.

Our family life has been very happy. Our four children are all

wonderful. Berta and I took our first “two weeks alone” vacation
to Mexico City in 1952. One of our happiest times was the sum-
mer of 1954 when we all toured the National Parks with our
tent and camping equipment. The other item that has changed
our way of living a bit was our eldest daughter’s intense interest
in horses. Due to this, we found one day in April, 1954, that we
were suddenly the owners of two Morgan horses, hers and mine.
Mine was a nine-month-old colt we called “Cocoa” and with the
help of my wife (I’m allergic to hay) we have raised him, I have
done most of his training and was amply rewarded at the National
Morgan Horse Show in July, 1957, when we took nine ribbons
out of the twelve classes entered. Over the next two years we
became a four-horse family. Berta and I have always found our
best times together so she had to have a horse to share the trail
Tiding, etc., and so we got “Buzzy.” Within the year “Buzzy” had
done so much for our Mary Louise that Berta turned him over to
her and then we got Berta a nice bay mare called “Amanda.” We
certainly have wonderful times with these horses. Through them
we have met some of the nicest people, as well as gained in other
Nays.

Barbara entered the Pennsylvania Hospital Training School in
\ugust, 1957, and took “Medallion,” her gelding, to Philadelphia
vith her. Our two boys are interested in horses and help in their
are but are much more interested in automobiles. Merrill got his
cense in 1957 and works hard to keep his car on the road.
fonty is still too young but is looking forward to the time when
e can drive.

We have been busy and interested in many things over the
ears as any family man knows. First it was Cub Scouts, Brownies

[ 529 ]

and Sunday School, then Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts and the Pilgrim
Fellowship. Berta has been on the schoo] committee for years
and I am a Town Meeting Member. We talk of the time when we .
shall have the time and money to travel.

MY work since graduation has, to my constant frustration, put a
number of thousands of miles and usually also an ocean between
me and every special Class Reunion. I hope to be sending all sorts
of chits in early 1958 into the State Department in Washington to
fix things somehow so as to get to Cambridge for the Twenty-fifth
Anniversary in June of 1958. For the Twentieth Anniversary, I
was in Austria; for the Fifteenth, Vladivostok on detail from the
Embassy in Moscow; for the Tenth, in Suez, Egypt; for the Fifth
and Third, I was in the lumber business in New Orleans and
Eureka, California, respectively. |

It would have taken a particularly good soothsayer with a
particularly good crystal ball in that last June of college to foretell
these various journeys and others, too, each rich with its own
particular life (it crawled pretty actively sometimes). I know

[ 530 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

that some of my fellow members of 1933 have cruised even more
widely for the last twenty-five years; I hope they have enjoyed
equally the privilege of some extra familiarity with other people
and other places. And most particularly, I would call them, too,
lucky if they have been working in some particular aspect of our
country’s activity overseas, And it’s not only the statutory
Foreign Service to which I refer; in places abroad where there has
been an American community I have come to know and enjoy
being a member of the total overseas American group, the business
men, the press, the armed services, as well as my own colleagues.

Although this is a thumbnail biography and not a promotional
effort for any type of career, I should like to say a few words that
may sound like the latter. I know of no higher priority occupa-
tion for this time than government service, particularly the
Foreign Service. Our own future lies in the massive tides of
human adjustment now occurring all over the world. The reward
for me, and I am sure I speak also for other foreign service officers,
is in large measure the privilege of participation and some contri-
bution in the highly complex field of representing and serving our
country and our courtymen, abroad. It is no glamorous highway,
it is rather a question of steady plugging interspersed with fre-
quent bursts of high pressure activity. But the vitality of the
work always remains.

There’s a most especial word to say about the basis given by
Harvard for this life. There was not a single course in a diversified
undergraduate study which I have not drawn upon. Equally im-
portant, Harvard furnished me guidelines and habits for develop-
ment of disciplined abilities and thinking. And I have only lately
begun to have an understanding of how Harvard represents
American idealism and tradition. I hope that Harvard will con-
tinue for long into the future to furnish mental and spiritual tools
to as many as possible of our professional Foreign Service.

On the practical side of an existence in the Foreign Service,
there are the usual quotas of successes and frustrations, joys and
irks which are part of any living. And it is still a rewarding life
even if the government salary is in an uncomfortably large part
financed by the recipient’s own income tax.

This is written in the first person singular, the meaning is plural.
It is we — my wife and I together ~ who have been doing this

[530]

job and leading this life since 1945. Sharing equally the work with
the foreigners in whose country we may be, making a home and
looking out for the small fry, as well as being active in our own
community — neither the responsibility nor “the effort required
of her is light. And, we have lots of fun in the process.

If my father, Dan Holder, of the Class of 1888 were living, my
Twenty-fifth Anniversary in 1958 would be his Seventieth An-
niversary. That is a spread of forty-five years. My son Bill’s
class should be 1970, which is thirty-seven years after his father
and eighty-two years after his grandfather. Sounds like the
march of the centuries. I hope young Bill will keep the succession
business moving a little bit faster than his progenitors; he'll pre-
sumably see more of his descendants if he does, in more senses
than one.

Having spent considerable time developing large muscles in
school and college years of vigorous sports and in manual labor
in the lumber business, the inevitable has happened since said
large muscles have been parked relatively unused behind a desk
most of the time. It isn’t the muscles which are now large. How-
ever, I have been able to whittle down the accumulation periodi-
cally by assaulting on skis the Alpine slopes of Vorarlberg on
winter vacations. When puffing uphill at eight or nine thousand
feet in the bright glare of the snow fields, I wonder how I ever
got into such a thing, anyhow. And it is fun to tramp through the |
farmers’ fields after the local game birds.

What sport will be next depends entirely on where “next” will be.
If it’s Washington, then it will probably be the pursuit of the weed
and the insect in the garden of our place in Chevy Chase. Or it
may be brushing up on the boomerang in Australia. Who knows?
We don’t — as of this writing.

What I aspired to be,

Perhaps it is true that the essence of life is not to be found by
all in the materialism that we assume to be the goal of all, perhaps
for an occasional one there is an equal gratification in a momentary
glimpse of light, of reality, of truth. For that occasional one, then,
shall life succeed in that it seems to fail.

THE first years after college found me working for a public
accounting firm by day and studying business administration at
the University of Pennsylvania at night. Three years of this
routine seemed more than adequate so I ceased the schooling and
switched jobs several times, attracted by what appeared to be
greener fields. A few years before the war started, I found myself
in the industrial engineering department of a large food processing
company. The work was interesting and permitted the exercise of
one’s imagination. The war years were spent attempting to im-
prove manufacturing methods in a plant producing thermal insu-
Jation for the Navy and the war industries. Shortly after the war
I joined the company which publishes the Saturday Evening Post
and have remained there since. No longer engaged in engineering
(although still interested in it), my primary activity is in the area
of financial planning and control. Collaterally, I am interested in
the extension of operations research techniques into the business
field. I am hopeful that, with the aid of an IBM 705 electronic
computor which we are about to acquire, it will be possible to
arrive at more nearly optimum solutions to business problems
than has been possible heretofore using empirical methods.

For some time I have been aware that I should be taking a more
active part in community affairs, particularly in trying to secure
better local government. Recently I have been campaigning for
the election of competent officials to our township offices. The
experience has been worth the effort involved. .

Like most of our classmates, I have had at one time or another

a variety of hobbies. A relatively new one which both my wife
and I enjoy is bird-watching. Well adapted for people who
aren't getting any younger, it has given us a reason for visiting
many interesting parts of the country which we would never have
seen otherwise. Most important perhaps is the interest which it
engenders in the conservation of wildlife and of our natural re-

sources generally.

college training group at Wanamaker’s (never a happy associa-
tion for me, but economically useful at the time), I turned to
banking in 1937 and joined the U.S. Trust Company of New
York, where I am still employed as supervisor of investment
research records.

My family is comprised of my wife and two daughters. I first
met my wife, Louise, in the summer of 1932, and after she
graduated from Oberlin College in 1937, we both worked in
New York until our marriage in 1938. We lived in New York
City until 1944, when we moved to Chappaqua in Westchester.
My oldest daughter, Louise, is now a freshman at the University
of Connecticut, and my young daughter, Mary, a sophomore in
high school. We live the usual commuter’s life in Chappaqua
with all the extra activities scheduled nightly. In the moments
between our daughters’ busy social life, my wife and I manage
to slip out for a Pizza, a movie, or an evening with friends.

My main hobby, I guess, is to keep one step ahead of the lawn
mower, the snow shovels or any other tool needed to keep a
house in order. I have even got to like the numerous tots my
wife supervises in her nursery school. Being exposed to three
ballet enthusiasts in the family, I have developed a liking and
even a mild understanding of that art.

We attend the local Episcopal Church where I usher on sched-
uled Sundays and assist at all functions such as the annual straw-
berry festival, (We ran a successful toy booth for five or six
years.) Politically, 1 have always been a Democrat. Locally,
I serve as an election inspector.

As a loyal class member, I have been a bit remiss. Having seen
very few of my classmates since graduation, I am looking for-
ward to our Twenty-fifth Reunion in June to renew my friend-
ship with the “Class of 1933.”

A QUARTER of a century of my progress will obviously have
less interest for the reader than for the writer. Here it goes any-.
way, in easily digestible form.

Though not colorful, my business career has been a satisfying
one. After leaving the shelter of the Business School, where I
was an assistant dean for two years, it took quite a while to find
that advertising was the best spot for me, Starting with a stint at
American Radiator, then York Corporation, I finally settled down
with General Electric — permanently, I hope.

Four and a half war years were spent in the War Production

[ 537]

Board and as a lieutenant in the Navy, securely anchored in Boston
for most of the time.

My work with G.E. in the last two years, Jaunching an industry-
wide campaign called “Live Better Electrically,” has been par-
ticularly rewarding. It is gratifying to play a part in stimulating
the entire electrical industry to join forces in order to gain a fair
share of the consumer dollar.

My family life has been as close to ideal as anyone could ask for.
Happily married for twenty-two years, with three fine children in
various stages of development. Carol has just entered Smith, and
I hope she is headed for a literary career, Charlie, sixteen, con-
centrates on sports with some degree of success in high school
basketball and baseball. Steve, eleven, is interested in many things,
with emphasis on planes and military equipment.

Mary and I have found the perfect hobby for a middle-aged
couple —a twenty-seven-foot cabin cruiser. We spend every
spare moment (and dollar) aboard our “yacht” on Barnegat Bay.
After a long period of trial and error — mostly running aground
— we seem to have mastered the fundamentals of seamanship.
Another hobby I enjoy without much skill is bridge, which shows
little improvement over the years,

During the spring, I also spend time with Little League base-
ball. It’s fun working with the younger boys before they realize
how little I know about the game.

My political convictions are still basically unchanged over the
years —a good, middle-of-the road Republican — and I believe
my faith in the party during the lean years of the New Deal has
at last been vindicated.

THE recent pattern of my life has undergone no major changes.
My interest ranges actively from business to boats and to rare
books. Sailing is, to me, the ideal outdoor hobby, proved by my
annual cruise “down east.”

As to book collecting, it can be stated accurately (tho’ im-
modestly) that mine is one of the finest collections on the His-
tory of Science of Navigation in private hands. It encom-
passes manuscripts dating from the ycar 811 A.D. to printed
books from 1468 A.D. A few examples, chosen from the many
score, of the books which I have given to Elarvard are: the first
dated geography, Milan, 1471; the first Spanish geography, Va-
lencia, 1482; the first printed arithmetic, Traviso, 1478; the first
navigation book, Venice, 1490; the first English arithmetic, Lon-
don, 1522; the first English Alarco Polo, London, 1578.

All this has led me to a close contact with the College, as a
member of the Overseers Committee to Visit the University
Library. Through its eager and capable staff, Harvard con-
tinues to inspire me to greater efforts— by convincing me that
I am a most fortunate intermediary for guiding books to their
rightful, necessary, glorious, nay inevitable, resting place in
Cambridge.

As a result of these rewarding interests, including “work,” I
am in a state of active semi-retirement — which will not, I hope,
change as the years pass. .

LIKE most of my classmates I found the world in ’33 to be not
exactly my oyster. An academic career having been (perhaps
fortunately) abandoned due to dat ole debbil money, I grabbed a
job in the Freight Trafic Department of the Santa Fe Railroad.
This carried me along till things began to ease up a bit, and in
1937, tiring of the slow march of railroad seniority, I jumped
over to a spot with the General Trafic Department of Sears,
Roebuck. While toiling days, I began the study of law nights at
Chicago-Kent College of Law. In June of 1942, I graduated
from that worthy institution and took and passed the bar ex-
aminations a week later. After kicking around a law office for
a few months, I was fortunate in having the opportunity to work
as law clerk with Judge Major of the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.

At this point, Uncle Sam pointed his finger at me and I went
into the Air Force. After kicking around various hot spots —
in temperature only, including Trinidad and Jamaica, B.W.L, I
arrived home a civilian, late in '45, While gathering up the
threads, I spent a few months as an assistant editor with Com-
merce Clearing House. In the spring of 1946 I moved over to
an association with the law firm of McCulloch & McCulloch,
and, almost at the same time, made an even better move in ac-
quiring a truly wonderful helpmeet, my wife Rose. These were
the days of the housing shortage, so that it was a real relief when
we acquired our home in Bellwood in 1947.

Several pleasant years followed, during which our first two
children were born. Then, in 1952, I struck out for myself.
Besides practising law, I also own a real estate business, the
All Realty Service. All this, plus our family, keeps me on the
go. “The law is a jealous mistress” says the old saw. At any
rate, I have to squeeze time to do any serious reading. My one
outside activity, at the present, is serving as trustee on our local
school board. This has been an interesting and pleasant ex-
perience,

ITS a far cry from the chem lab at Mallinckrodt to international
legal studies. Elarvard can be thankful it isn’t held accountable
for the shapes our careers have taken during the past twenty-
five years. Yet Hlarvard had more than the usual influence on
mine, perhaps because I spent more than the usual time at Har-
vard.

A Ph.D. at Harvard in chemical physics followed a one-year
“interval” at Cal Tech immediately after graduation. Then came
a Junior Fellowship. And then came my decision, much as I
enjoyed my work in chemical physics, to work instead with
people in pursuits which need to catch up with the physical

[ 542 ]

sciences and from which accordingly the world has more to
gain in our times—so it seemed to me and still seems. This
career change wasn’t exactly easy and took at least two steps.
The first, for which I was permitted to complete my Junior
Fellowship, was a combination of sociological studies at Harvard
and a community study in the Italian North End of Boston, with
another Fellow. The second, for which I had reluctantly to re-
turn again to formal studies, at the University of Chicago Law
School, made me a lawyer. I continue to regard myself as a
lawyer, a view, however, I must admit my “real lawyer” friends
in private practice don’t share.

By this time, the war was on, I had three children and Wash-
ington was my destination. Nine years in government service
more than rewarded me for my long-in-the-winning law de-
gree in the richness of the experiences and responsibilities the
brought. They also left in me an indelible respect for the public
service and the caliber and qualities of those in it. The Lend-
Lease program, under which I became associate general counsel
of the Foreign Economic Administration; the Paris Conference
on Reparations from Germany; the United Nations, on which
I worked as assistant legal adviser in the Department of State;
the Truman Doctrine, under which I served in Greece as Deputy
Chief of Mission; and finally postwar problems of foreign policy
as Special Assistant to the Secretary of State and as Planning
Adviser for the Near East, South Asia and Africa — these were
seven-days-a-week activities which turned my wife from a law
widow to a war widow, yet far luckier in this respect than
wives of men overseas in the services. My eyes being such as to
keep me out of active combat duty, I tried twice to volunteer my
services and learned that the two things I was, a lawyer and a
chemist, “were a dime a dozen in the armed services and the
sources of the most frequent complaints for lack of suitable as-
signments.”

I joined the Ford Foundation in 1951, attracted by its bold
objectives and its president, Paul Hoffman, whose leadership I
so admired in the Marshall Plan program. In the past six years
I have traveled over a quarter of a million airplane miles, most
of them in the under-developed countries of the Near East, Asia

[ 543 ]

and Africa. The task of helping to inaugurate and shape the
Foundation’s world-wide educational activities has been most
challenging. My present concern is with American universities
and colleges, Harvard among them, in international studies and
overseas activitics in such fields as foreign area studies, develop-
ment, forcign policy, law and education.

My family — wife and four children — are my most cherished
assets. The two oldest children — girl and boy — have entered
college, Manhattanville and Harvard, which means two of the
assets have become liabilities. The two youngest — boy and
girl —are of high school and elementary school vintage. We are
a nomadic family, the children never having been two years in
a row in the same school until three years ago. Cambridge,
Chicago, Washington, Pittsburgh, Washington, Greece, Wash-
ington, Scarsdale, Pasadena, Scarsdale is the family’s itinerary.
Evidence that the children have thrived, at least not suffered
unduly, is the older girl’s life goal “to get married and travel.”
We fecl very settled having now lived in Scarsdale four years in
succession. Full credit for management under these varied cir-
cumstances goes to my wife, who likes to run things. Having
had a fling at activities at Pitt, some teaching and relief work,
and then the children and me, now that two are at college, she
has taken on the P.T.A., at the youngest’s local elementary
school.

Challenge, etc.; completed and edited Fletcher Pratt’s posthumously
published Compact History of the United States Navy, 1957.

AFTER leaving Harvard, I devoted seven or eight years to
various journalistic activities, including reporting and rewrite
for a press association, a brief spell on a picture magazine and
a highly educational stretch as a free-lance writer. During the
war I spent four and a half years as a Navy P.R.O., of which
the high point was covering the preparation and installation of
the top-secret Mulberry harbors off the Normandy beachheads.
During this period I also managed to get married and start a
family. I returned to civilian life as a magazine writer and editor
and have since been busy in magazine journalism, advertising
and public relations.

I am now director of public relations for the English-Speaking
Union of the United States, a vigorous organization of some
27,000 Americans who believe that if the people of the Common-
wealth and the United States don’t hang together we are bound
to hang—or to be atomized — separately. The E-SU has a
very practical and far-flung program to do something about
this, with the result that my job not only presents stimulating
professional problems to be solved but also gives me a chance
to work for objectives that I consider vitally important.

For several years my magazine writing has been concentrated
in the interpretation of science and technology to the general
reader, an area that seems to grow in importance every day. I
now write the Atlantic Reports on Science and Industry for
the Atlantic Monthly and last fall I served as contributing editor
to the AZlantic’s special Centennial Issue on Science and Industry.

As I continue to write an occasional full-size magazine article
and also to serve as a special consultant to industry in the field
(all in my spare time), I find my days reasonably well taken
up. My family, which now includes three boys and a girl in
addition to my wife, is ever more interesting and absorbing. I
find it difficult to give as much time as I would like to political
activities, despite unflagging enthusiasm in my private life for
the liberal traditions of the Democratic Party. It is an unfortunate

[ 545]

aspect of the American political system that it is extremely diffi-
cult for anyone to take part on an amateur basis unless he is
cither a lawyer or the possessor of private means.

Ac the moment our lives seem likely to grow more busy
rather than less so, since we have acquired a salt-water farm
in southeastern Massachusetts where we plan to combine sailing
with quahog-treading and bee-keeping, The only solution seems
to be the thirty-hour day and I wish somebody would hurry
and invent it.

Stroking my long gray beard in hopes of coming up with
concentrated wisdom doubly distilled over twenty-five years, I
find only conclusions that are neither novel nor unique. The
quarter-century has come and gone with the speed of light (ap-
proximately 186,000 miles per second). I have found in my own
life that human beings can be remarkably happy in a period
of history crammed with wars, depressions, massacres, threats
of mass annihilation, gross tyrannies and man-eating inflation.
I can’t say I’ve enjoyed every minute of it, but on the whole

I’ve been lucky enough to have a remarkably fine time and I
can scarcely wait to see what happens next.

TWENTY-FIVE years have gone by very quickly. Upon
leaving college, I entered the insurance business and I am still in
the same office fighting harder than ever. At first, during every
spare moment, I did considerable traveling, thoroughly covering
most of the land between here and Jerusalem, then South
America, the South Seas and Australia where I was happy to get
on a national broadcast to talk on Boston. Now I stay closer to
home base and receive much pleasure from activities with the
Harvard Travelers Club working with and trying to help others
who want to go to some far corner of the globe. World War II
turned my thoughts in a different direction for four years. As
airborne radar officer in the 418th Night Fighter Squadron, 5th
Airforce, I followed the front lines from Australia right into
Tokyo. Now I enjoy life on a farm. Two years ago a new state
highway cut my farm in two, very much against my will, but
I still have 70 choice acres left. Last June one of our purebred
Corridale ewes cut 20 pounds of wool and as yet we have not
heard of any sheep of any breed in this country that has shorn
20 pounds of wool.

I am now a strong supporter of the Protestant Episcopal
Church, and I give much time and effort in this direction, for I
am convinced that religion is one of the strongest forces in the
world today that will hold thinking people together. From now
on our days are limited. I have many plans, and I hope I will
have time to see most of them completed.

A CHANGE of address in itself is not necessarily a major event,
but in the case of this postcard-prodded correspondent, it con-
stitutes the important occurrence since our Vicennial Report.

After passing these too many years in the environs of Cam-
bridge and Watertown, Massachusetts (excepting those spent
in service), we set up last year in Westchester County, New
York, and for commuting and socializing substituted the New
York Central for the Harvard Square rapid transit, and the
Bronx River and the Major Deegan Parkways for Soldiers Field
and Storrow Drive.

Following graduation, I took my A.B. into battle with the

business began to be assigned a priority number from the U.S.
Navy.

J spent six months in the Naval Communications School at
our Fair Harvard —living in the Yard, and cutting far fewer
classes than during my earlier matriculation. The Naval Air
Station at Quonset Point, Rhode Island, was my first billet, fol-
lowed by an assignment to a Fleet Air Wing in Cuba, and thence
as Air Group Secretary in Key West, Florida. In 1944, I received
orders to attend the joint military government school at Prince-
ton (please pardon), and after a stopover at Monterey, Califor-
nia, went on to Tinian Island in the Marianas.

The year 1946 brought me back to Watertown, and the first
visit with a son approaching eleven months. That year I joined
‘Universal Atlas Cement Company as their Boston representative.
New Year’s of 1956 was celebrated as a resident of the State of
New York, resulting necessarily after a transfer to our com-
pany headquarters in New York City as assistant sales manager.

We miss, at times, the trackless trolleys, the Charles River,
Boylston Street and Harvard Square, and particularly many
friends enjoyed over half a lifetime. On the other hand, we
have found New York rewarding and stimulating with sub-
urban living very pleasant and city-visiting very entertaining.

the word. But, as an advertising man, I rejoice in the current
activities of the Publicity Committce for the Harvard College
Program. The almost complete lack of appreciation for mighty
Harvard here in the West has too long been a source of dis-
comfort to me.

My move to the West Coast was the result of a happy decision
by the Bureau of Personnel, U.S. Navy, As a j.g. in 1942, I
suggested that I could best help to win the war by taking over
responsibilities i in the Philadelphia Shipyards . . . instead, I was
sent to Pearl Harbor and was given the opportunity of seeing
the Hawaiian Islands for the first time. My preparation for my
naval career, which extended into late 1945 (staff secretary,
Lighter Than Air Command, Moffett Field California) was
usual and, I hope, normal.

Even in 1933 Wall Street beckoned and my first position was
with DeCopper & Doremus, odd-lot brokers, on lower Broad-
way, New York City. I sold casualty insurance for the Liberty
Mutual Insurance Company in middle Manhattan. I sold asphalt
roofing for Certain-teed Products Company in the Middle West
and Southwest. Then, back to New York and Philadelphia with
the Barber Asphalt Company and the position of advertising
manager.

I joined the Advertising Division, San Francisco office, of the
Curtis Publishing Company, late in 1945. We publish fine
magazines and it is a gratifying job to sell the advertising that
goes into them. In spite of the many and varied arguments to
the contrary, I can definitely state here and now the * ‘print is
here to stay.”

Both daughters are California-born and Mrs. Hunter and I
like living in the West. There are handicaps, of course — and
one of them is my inability to attend all of my reunions. I am
not going to miss my Twenty-fifth.

1T does not seem possible that twenty-five years have gone by
since I was preparing to take my degree at Harvard. Perhaps
the fact that I went on to take a law degree and spent five years
in the Infantry has shortened the span of years in my mind’s eye.
The years at College are well remembered and in day dreams I
feel I could readily return to the same courses and friends, but
such thoughts should be shelved very definitely if one is to
enjoy the present fully.

After the Army released me in good physical condition, I
returned to the practice of law and in my spare time I had some
pleasant sails along the coast of New England. This sport has
been almost forgotten now that I have a wife and children. We
first bought a small new home and indulged in the usual pur-
suits of raising grass and evergreens. Then we acquired an older
number and did some remodeling, so now we try to keep it up,
the children down, and the grass in respectable condition. ‘The
summer's project was to paint the exterior of our home, and it
was a pleasant pastime, even with a six and one-half-year-old and
a five-year-old to help. Their sights are not set on such work
however, as Polly intends to be a ballet dancer and Peter plans

to outdistance Ted Williams in home runs. My wife has a fixa-
tion on the Red Sox and roots long and loud through all the
team’s ups and downs whether away or at home, but with her
responsibilities she is generally limited to television and radio
to follow the games. She will be Peter’s loudest booster. To-
gether the family enjoys the shore in summer, and skating in the

winter, and Eleanor and I see a play once in a while, like to
dance, and play bridge whenever we can.

The practice of law has been wonderful as a chosen field, and
my practice has centered principally on estates, wills, trusts and
other Probate Court matters, with much tax and corporation law

to keep things interesting. I am in court regularly and I relish
that stumulation.

I have been connected with a fair quota of charitable drives,

L552]

church affairs, Sunday School classes, Boy Scouts, Cub Scouts,
Civilian Defense, P.T.A., and been active in organizing im-

rovement associations, but today I prefer to beg off from some
of that effort and to concentrate on the practice of law and the
enjoyment of family and home.

FROM Law School to 1946, I served the customary apprentice-
ship with a large New York City law firm. This was interrupted
by several years spent as the assistant to a Judge of the U.S. Tax
Court. Asa result, I am now sometimes known, in polite circles
at least, as a tax specialist. In 1946, my partners (all Elis) and I
formed our present law firm. This has been a very pleasant as-
sociation despite the temporary strain which develops each year
at about the time of the Yale game.

While still in Law School, I convinced Helen McMahan, the
sister of our classmate, Knight, that marriage was a fate better
than Radcliffe. The results speak for themselves. After moving
around for ten years, we finally settled in Peekskill. Our chil-
dren have all attended the Peekskill public schools, which have
been able to maintain high standards in spite of my term on the
School Board. Like many of our classmates, while at home, I am

expected to be an authority on all the subjects now taught in
the public schools of this Srate. Frankly, I sometimes feel I

should get higher grades on the papers which my kids turn in.

It has been our good fortune to spend many of our vacations

and to take a number of trips together as a family. Last sum-
mer, for example, the nine of us drove out to Colorado and New
Mexico; for the benefit of the cynics, if there be any in our
midst after twenty-five years, I report that it was a lot of fun.

In politics, I am a conservative and an independent. As such,

I have no present party affiliation, and from the looks of things
no change seems imminent in the foreseeable future.

One final constructive item — which may prove heartening to
some of our classmates — is that much of my time (when I am
not doing my own work or my kids’ homework) is spent in

church activities—as an elder and church school teacher in
our local Presbyterian Church.

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

PUBLICATIONS: Some seventy-five plus papers on experimental and clinical
surgical problems, mostly in the fields of cardiovascular and pediatric

surgery.
THE four years at the Medical School were followed by | an in-
ternship and surgical training in New York City. Little did I
realize how profoundly this decision to leave Boston was to re-
direct the entire course of my development. Born and educated
a Bostonian, little-traveled, and living at home through the eight
years of academic training at Harvard, the move to this foreign
city signified the cutting of the umbilical cord —and embodied
for me many of the features already experienced by most of my
classmates who had left home to go to school. What a shock
it was to learn that things could be done differently from the
way which we had been taught, and still be at least as correct,
if not more so! The period of training included two return en-
gagements in Boston, one at the Boston Lying-In Hospital in
1940, and the second at the Children’s Medical Center from the
middle of 1946 to the middle of 1947, where Drs. Sidney Far-
ber and Robert Gross attempted to teach me something about
children. Fourteen years after graduation from college I ven-
tured into the practice of pediatric surgery in New York City
and persevered in this for three years. Since July 1, 1950, I have
enjoyed my present full-time occupation in charge of the Surgi-
cal Division at the Montefiore Hospital, with the academic rank
of clinical professor of surgery in Columbia University. This is
a fascinating occupational situation, allowing as much time as
one would like for the care of patients and research, with ad-
ministrative responsibilities that can be managed in a minimum
of time. My own interests have been particularly in the fields
of cardiovascular and pediatric surgery. Currently we are ac-
tively working on the repair of congenital and acquired defects
within the. heart, using an artificial heart lung apparatus, and
arresting the heart while the actual repair work is going on.
How primitive our present efforts will seem in a few years must
be woefully apparent, when we consider how little of this was
possible just two or three years ago!

The hospital is located about twenty minutes from head-
quarters, in the form of a wife and four children on an acre of

ground in Scarsdale. How Micky manages this menage is a
mystery to me. Robert, at sixteen, a junior in the Scarsdale High
School, is pointing for a career in mammology and would like
to go to Harvard. He represents our prewar quota. Mark, Sam
and Jan are in varying phases of school and pre-school. They are
all a considerable source of joy, each with his own strong in-
dependent personality. The fourth child and only girl is having
no difficulty in meeting the challenge of holding her own with
so many males to plague her. The dog and cat, of course, plus

usually a turtle or so, frogs, and the other friends that children

acquire and live with in a large old house. Out back there is a

remodeled barn, a swimming pool, fruit trees, a vegetable garden

and a well. Just trying to keep up with the grounds and the

work on the house represents my golf, tennis, skiing and setting-

up exercises, and has managed pretty well to stay the forty-

three-year-old spread around the middle.

Much of my traveling was done as a doctor with the USS.
Department of the Navy, including the invasions ‘of New
Georgia, Vella Lavella, Treasury, Bougainville, Emirau, Saipan
and Guam —all as medical officer for an amphibious task force,
working on LST’s. More of the same in the invasions of Peleliu,
Iwo Jima and Okinawa, although under the improved circum-
stances of operating aboard the hospital ship, Solace. This latter
tour of duty represents one of the outstanding experiences of my
life, working with a first-class group of doctors, nurses and
corpsmen. There is little point in reemphasizing the utter
senselessness of the situations that called forth this effort. But
these were fine people, doing a messy job, and doing it extra-
ordinarily well. And Auckland and Wellington and Oahu —
these I should like to revisit in peacetime. Then there was a trip
to Europe with Robert in 1953, centering around the showing of
a motion picture on the working of a heart valve at the Univer-

sity of Edinburgh and the University of Lisbon. We can speak

with authority about the zoos in Dublin, Glasgow, Edinburgh,

London (and Whipsnade) and Lisbon. A lecture tour in 1955

enabled me to enjoy the finer side of life in Jamaica and Trini-

dad, where the Carnival has to be scen to be believed. Partici-
pation in surgical meetings has taken us to most parts of this

[556]

country, and the fascination of San Francisco is still strong
upon us.

It would be wonderful, and far too much to hope for, if the
next twenty years could be invested in consolidation of and de-
velopment from this background. I hope that college will be a
different type of experience for my children than it was for me,
particularly from the point of view of attitude. While I believe
it is extremely important for everyone in college to have some
idea of his ultimate work, college can and should represent more
than just a period of preparation for the particular work. Or
at least, in preparation for that work, more attention should be
paid to and advantage taken of the other features of college life,
which I now realize I could have developed more fully. I sup-
pose few people at college actually realize and grasp the magni-
tude of their opportunity, and I was certainly one of the many
who failed to see the forest for the trees. The importance of a
background at Harvard becomes increasingly clear to me each
year, as we interview candidates for various hospital appoint-
ments.

AFTER graduation I went to Europe for a few months and upon
my return worked for the Chase National Bank in New York
City for two years. I then returned to Philadelphia and entered
the investment banking business. In 1937 I was married, and on
May 11, 1941, I reported for active duty with the Army as a
second lieutenant. After seeing this country at the Army’s ex-
pense, I was sent to the ETO where I stayed about seventeen
months. I was discharged as a full colonel on January 20, 1947.
I spent a little while getting to know my family, and then became
a partner in a small investment banking underwriting firm, Asp-
den, Robinson & Company. We merged on November 1, 1956;

investment firm. This firm is much larger and more diversified
with many more outlets. I am co-manager of the bond depart-
ment and shuttle back and forth between New York and Phila-
delphia attending underwriting syndicate meetings.

I have been married for over twenty-one years to a most ideal,
patient, understanding wife. We have two sons and a small
daughter, almost a grandchild, who have brought us great joy
and happiness and kept us young and active. Our mutual love
for horses has been followed in the fox hunting field, even to the
point of flying to England to follow the hounds. Breeding and
racing horses on a very small scale is our latest venture. In ad-
dition, Beagling with the family on Sunday afternoons; book
collecting (only sporting ones relating to horses); working for
the Red Cross, the United Fund and all the usual community
and church drives, take up some of my spare time. We live
about twenty-two miles from Philadelphia in the country, and
when I cannot get my wife or children to do some work around
our fifteen acres, I do.

All in all I probably have not accomplished too much, but I
do a lot, see a lot, have a host of friends all over this country
and England, and am happy and contented.

the comments on the false material values in American life

banal, ineffective and, in most cases, entirely just.

MY life as a Washington lawyer may be extending, intense,
nerve-wracking, and at times frustrating. It may lead to a bit of
cynicism. But it is rarely, if ever, dull. Ours is the desperate
case (otherwise we are not called upon — it’s too easy). Ours
is the case that the Congress and the regulations writers never
thought of. In short, the Washington lawyer is making law
every day in application to individual and unique situations.

My practice has also involved a good deal of travel. I’ve been
all through the Midwest, to the West Coast, Texas, Puerto Rico,
Cuba and Mexico. Unfortunately, while ’'ve worked on fasci-
nating problems in world trade, I haven’t yet discovered a client
who felt it necessary for me to go to Europe or North Africa
or the Orient. Clients want to be coached on how to handle their
transaction and then take the trips themselves.

My work in charitable organizations has been most rewarding.
Barney Neighborhood House in Southwest Washington does its
best to keep the children off the streets and to give the teen-age
gangs a healthy outlet for youthful energies. We are also work-
ing on school lunches on the theory that children cannot learn
on empty stomachs. We were integrated three years ago and,
while not devoid of problems, we think it can work. St. John’s
Orphanage has embarked on a new program for mentally re-
tarded children. The finance chairman’s duties are not contined
to investing our limited funds. He is on emergency call daily.

In April, 1947, at the hoary old age of thirty-six, I married the
most wonderful and understanding woman in the world and I
recommend late marriage to everyone. Having a boy of eight
and a girl of six is enough to keep anyone young (or tired!).
Their friends’ parents are all at least ten years younger than we
and our friends’ children are either in college or getting mar-
ried. It’s all very broadening. Summers we spend at the Cape
and get a lot of good sailing, swimming and tennis. I play tennis,
sometimes even singles, in Washington, spring, summer and fall;
badminton during the winter.

Washington offers everything that can be desired in a city,
except a dry climate. It is where one has an opportunity to
meet or see every famous, or infamous, personality in the world.
I'm glad I came here and settled and I look forward to man
more years of interesting practice. I hope that my son will have
the abiliry and the inclination to become a Harvard son. At
present, I find it necessary to pull him away from cowboy pis-
tols and football to do his homework for Beauvoir School in
preparation for St. Alban’s—a far cry from those of you who
married during the 1930’s.

Wre've heard so much about the Twenty-fifth Reunion from
our predecessors that we can hardly wait to get there. Mean-
while, great activities for the Program for Harvard College!

MATRICULATION at the University of Pennsylvania School
of Veterinary Medicine, commencing September, 1938, was
interrupted in December, 1940, by my being called into the
Army, in the grade of first lieutenant, Coast Artillery. War
service in World War II included service in England, Africa,
Italy, France and Germany, with release from active ¢ duty in
1946 in the grade of lieutenant colonel.

Returned to the University of Pennsylvania School of Veter-
inary Medicine and graduated in 1948. Established a private
-practice in New Hampshire, my interests centered in large
animal practice, but dependent on pets for bread and butter.
Again my enjoyable civilian pursuits were interrupted by a call
to the Army for Korean service. Upon return to the United
States in July, 1954, I determined to stay in the Army in an
attempt to complete twenty-years active duty. An assignment
at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, entailed “volunteering” for air-

borne status.
After a European tour in the Army I intended to retire from

the Army, settle on a farm in North Carolina, carry on a limited
practice, experiment in breeding Aberdeen Angus cattle, and
raise my two boys to be farmers.

I am still in a peculiar niche —a grandfather with an abiding
interest in veterinary medicine and farming , jumping out of open
doors of speeding airplanes as a vocation, My life must change
shortly.

war industries in New York and Brooklyn; I learned something
about ward-politics and draft-boards, also learned who our real
enemies were; passed as a good guy, not too quick. In 1945 I
began teaching at Washington Square College, one of the liberal
arts divisions of New York University, where I am still em-
ployed. In the summer of 1938 my wife and I took a bicycle
tour of northern France and England, returning just on the eve
of the Sudeten crisis. Our first child was learning to walk during
the fall of France.

I shouldn’t be surprised if my total experience has not been
much like that of my classmates—a quarter-century process
of trying to discover my identity, alone and with the help of
signs and signals from the other masks around me. “All flows”:
it is impossible to say what, for a given psyche in a given carcass,
the process has “been like.” All one can do is cite the various
reasons for wonder: that physically the world contains so much
beauty, that people take leave of it on such short notice and
often for such trifling reasons, that the children we produce
look so like us and yet are not us, that our precious enmities and
hostilities are mostly absurd, that despite the boast (at least in
the American economy) that each one looks out for number
one, we manage tenuously to support one another. This last is
particularly wondrous for a teacher, suspecting as he does the
little store that the rest of you set by the service he performs.
Yet he continues to eat.

My wife and I have three musical and quite literate children.
We get along without a television set, though we go to some
pains to see movies. On our vacation this summer we took a
sleeping-bag-station-wagon trip into Canada, Michigan, Wiscon-
sin, etc., leaking books onto the road every time we stopped at a
Howard Johnson’s. Discreet recourse to the bottle took care of
the worst discomforts of such a trip, philosophy the rest. We
are a God-fearing family but apt to be absent-minded or lost in.
thought.

Assuming that hobbies ; are something by nature unconstruc-
tive and obsessive, that mending things or “exercise” don’t count,
I offer as my hobbies the roaming I do by foot or bicycle on the
beautiful roads of upper Westchester — with my son when he
is not in baseball fever— and the studying of mathematics on

my hour-and-a-half train ride into the city. Philosophically, I am
an uncertain Platonist in that I believe that the mind is not some-
thing coextensive with the brain or nervous system, and yet I
am not very anxious to have the two separated quite yet. If we
are entering upon the greatest of intellectual revolutions since
the Neolithic, it is not because our minds are going to be “freed”
by automation for more horseracing and bingo but because they
will be forced to keep up with the tools they have devised —
the same as with Stone Age man.

On the whole I do not face the future with unmixed glee.
For one thing my finite mind balks at thought of uncontrolled
population growth, for I am sure that I shall never relish my
plankton eaten at a quarter-mile-long feeding station, nor shall |
enjoy my small allotment of sitting space. One thing our class
could do, though it may not be very much, we could pass the
word along to our children to go slow; I mean in the matter of
grandchildren.

MY engineering career started in 1939 when I entered the em-
ploy of the Baltimore Gas & Electric Company. The interven-
ing six years after graduation had been taken up by various ex-
periences, both agreeable and disagreeable. In retrospect, these
latter years of the Depression form a convenient zero reference
point for my subsequent scale of living and progress. In Balti-

[571]

more, I found the employment I was seeking, the opportunity
that I wanted, and the girl I was to marry.

My undergraduate education prepared me to be a mechanical
engineer. In order to temper this specialization, I continued my
formal education for another year beyond 1933 across the
Charles at the Business School. In spite of this exposure to the
profit motive, my primary preoccupation for years was with the
inorganic things of Nature, her forces and materials. During re-
cent years, I have undergone a gradual transition from a techni-
cal to an administrative engineer. This transition has brought
with it a large change in outlook, a shifting of preoccupation
from the things of Nature to an interest in getting people to do
things.

This shift in outlook has produced a corresponding change in
my interests and activities. Before, I found my evenings filled
with family sociability, bridge, chess and reading. Now, my
evenings are becoming more and more tightly scheduled with
committee meetings, mostly professional and to a large degree
directed at the multitudinous problems that arise from our ef-
forts to live together in communities.

Some, if not all, of these professional involvements are stimu-
lating fare. For example, for several years I was chairman of a
state Committee set up to encourage high school students in
Maryland to obtain an adequate preparation in mathematics and
science and to counsel the qualified to consider a career in en-
gineering. In an effort made last year to bring home to the
students the importance of mathematics in industry, we arranged
for seventy-eight practising engineers to take over for a day the
mathematics classes in all the junior and senior high schools in
the Ciry of Baltimore. On this day we reached 12,000 students.
Such programs carry their own rewards.

My three girls, Eleanor, Betsy and Christine, are growing up
rapidly. Hforseback riding is their interest of the day to be
succeeded by I know not what. Through conscientious atten-
tion, | have been able to capture on film many of their fleeting
interests, violent enthusiasms and myriad activities.

As to the future, Hester and I look to the education of our
children, to the continued pursuit of our interests, and to the

[572]

fulfillment of our long-held dream of a summer place on the
eastern shore of Maryland. Over the years, we have established
a satisfactory pattern of interests and activities which enables us
to look ahead with confidence and anticipation.

sired. Consequently, the expanding family and the new work
dominate my activities with gardening (major in raspberries) and
golf as outdoor sidelines.

IN college days my interests centered on writing but I have
managed to become a writer only by association. Back in the
thirties, I was sure that to write a man had first to have lived.
Dean Cary considerately permitted me a year’s leave from Har-
vard to test this theory. Between jobs on ships I spent some in-
teresting wecks getting to know the New York waterfront. I
returned to Harvard wiser, but still not a writer. Soon I switched
to Rollins College where a student, then at least, was permitted
to devote himself to the pursuit of a single subject. This was
concentration without the distribution that made the whole
thing make sense in the Harvard of President Lowell’s day.

I arrived at Rollins in time to be caught up in what Time
magazine dubbed the “Rumpus at Rollins.” This was a bitter
quarrel over teaching method and tenure. One result was the
resivnation of several teachers and students. Another was the
formation, by this group of renegades, of a new college at Black
Mountain, North Carolina. The aim of the new college was to
apply some of the educational theories we had discussed at

[574]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

length before and during the Rumpus. Black Mountain caused
a mild stir in the educational world with its theories of student
participation in administration, emphasis on creative arts, and
its requirement that a student, to be graduated, pass stiff oral
and written examinations given by a group of outside examiners,
none of whom had taught the student and each of whom was an
expert in the student’s special field. Eventually the college
foundered on the “Progressive” ideas on which it had been
founded. Times changed and so did theories. And the college,
always short on capital, was unable either to finance its plane or
to attract and hold capable educators.

Emerging as the college’s first graduate, I went to work in
New York as a printer’s devil. After a year of errand-running,
slip-sheeting, and proof-reading, I quit. In the four-month in-
terim until the next job, I ran something called the Alphabet
Press. This was a second-hand job press.1 set up in a borrowed
corner of a Sixth Avenue drugstore cellar. The aim of the press
was to print, in attractive format, the work of young and un-
known writers and to illustrate it with the work of young and
unknown artists. After two slim publications had appeared, the
druggist requisitioned the space occupied by the press. By print-
ing quantities of his bottle labels I bribed the druggist to let me
continue a little longer, but eventually the press was carted off
to a scrap dealer. The Alphabet Press faded from the scene
without having rocketed one artist or author to fame.

My next job brought me into the newspaper fold where many
a black sheep has strayed and stayed. This was interesting
work from the beginning. The first assignment was to assist
a distinguished printer-typographer, Elmer Adler, in the or-
ganization of a company museum. His aim was to tell the story
— mainly with original material — of man’s fifty-thousand-year
struggle to learn how to communicate with his fellow man by
means of visual symbols. The show, now a permanent feature
of the tenth floor of the The Times Annex, is well worth an
hour’s visit.

A variety of assignments followed: I ran the newspaper's
library and information bureau, did some book reviewing,
worked as a city reporter and radio news writer. In 1942 I be-
came editor of The New York Times Index and a year later en-

[575]

tered the armed forces. I was sent to the Lakehurst Naval Air
Station to be trained as a weather forecaster, stayed on as in-
structor. Late in 1944 I was transferred to the Pacific as one
of the Navy’s first group of enlisted “combat” correspondents.
I joined the battleship New Afexico at Pearl Harbor and was
with her throughout the Okinawa campaign and until the first
landings on Japan. With the coming of peace, and after more
than a million words of combat reporting, I returned to The
Times to manage the sale of its Index and microfilm edition. In
i951 I was sent to Paris as European manager for the New
York Times international edition, then printed in Paris for dis-
tribution throughout Europe and eastward to Hong Kong.

The year 1951 was a rough one for France. Runaway infla-
tion and intense labor unrest forced an appraisal of other print-
ing centers and it was decided to move to Holland. I then
formed a Dutch subsidiary and trained its all-Dutch staff. One
day we quietly stopped printing in Paris, and the next day
quietly resumed publication in Amsterdam. The move was not
entirely uneventful. One indignant subscriber, a crusty ex-
newspaper publisher from the mid-west, wrote us from Switzer-
land about this time asking us to readdress his papers to his new
address in Stockholm. Unfortunately this subscriber’s dossier
had become hopelessly merged with others in a file that arrived
upside down from Paris. Too embarrassed to admit this and
unable to locate the subscriber’s original address plate, we simply
began service on a new subscription. Months later we received
an acid note from Stockholm enclosing a substantial bill in pese-
tas. It seems that a former servant had forwarded a large ac-
cumulation of newspapers from the subscriber’s old address in
the Azores to his new address in Stockholm and had thought-
fully included a bill for postage and service. Several such mix-
ups, caused by the move, haunted us for months, but subscribers,
by and large, are a tolerant lot.

After five years in Europe I was reassigned to New York and
from there I now keep a watchful eye on Times international
editions printed in Amsterdam, Lima, Manila, Melbourne, and
Tokyo—a varied and interesting occupation.

NEVER look behind, something may be gaining on you. That’s
what the man said. But a quick glance backward once every
twenty-five years shouldn’t turn you into a pile of salt, just con-
geal you with horror. My progress hasn’t been so much ON
and UP as ALONE and SIDEWAYS. James Maddern Waller
could never say of me (as he has of Elbrecht Drausler): “This
man is a giant; the brilliance of his marketing ideas crystallizes
in the air like bird song; he is the mouthpiece of the business
world calling it on to victory.”

I have never been the champion of a cause (though I watched
several perform at a distance). And until this fall when school
opened, I have never had any strangely powerful race obsessions
against members of my own. All I’ve tried to do is not spit
against the wind too often, keep enough of that American green
stuff syphoning my way to straighten teeth and give a family of
three the basic advantages. What these are is still a mystery.
I was also going to mention “and keep out of debt,” but why
even bring it up with Ivan ahead in the space race. And besides,
grandfather simply had too many healthy children.

To keep both ends meeting (it’s getting more Herculean each

[577]

month), I’ve been trying for years (in Boston, now Chicago) to
help manufacturers increase their product sales, first on the in-
dustry side of the track, now the ad agency side. New products
have been most interesting: Is there a market for it? How big?
Who? The best way to introduce it? And the old cliché “give
it flying speed”? Not much to it, except trying to boil a plan
down into sixty or eighty lucid, meaningful, logical selling pages.
Merchandising, research, marketing, that’s the job description.
And for more factual details, don’t go to Wakeman’s Hucksters,
just join an agency for ten months or talk to Thayer Cummings.
Better still, ignore it entirely and stick to your own rat race.

For the rest, ’'ve managed painfully to learn a little more
about who I am. Socrates at least would approve. And eventu-
ally, when the interminable material needs (?}) of two superior
progeny terminate, I hope to step off the merry-go-round suf-
ficiently alive to take up some form of teaching. My long-
suffering good wife will appreciate the regular hours. But who
can look beyond dinner tonight? Not even a Chicago scavenger,
I see by the local papers. The stone I’ve skipped across the river
hasn’t reached the other side yet. Maybe it will during the next
twenty-five years. I hope I'll be able to submit a more interest-
ing report to the happy few at that time. On second thought,
I hope there’ll be a 1983 meeting and I can just attend.

MEMBER OF: Rocky Fork Hunt & Country Club, Columbus, Ohio; Columbus
Country Club; Princess Anne Country Club, Virginia Beach, Va.;
Bridgehampton Club, Bridgehampton, Long Island, N.Y.; Cape Fear
Club, Wilmington, N.C.; Shenandoah Club, Roanoke, Va.

AFTER a trip to Europe in the summer of 1933, I went to
Middletown, Ohio, on the labor reserve of the Armco Steel Cor-
poration, eventually working up to second helper on the open
hearth at the old Central Works. In the summer of 1934, I re-
turned to Columbus as a trainee in the local I.B.M. sales office.
There was a two months’ school session in Endicott in the fall,
whence I was assigned to the Birmingham, Alabama, office. In
August of 1935, I was transferred to Memphis for two months,
then back to the sales school in Endicott. Upon completion of
that course, I was assigned a sales territory, again in Columbus,
making the 100% Club in 1936. In December, 1938, I left 1.B.M.
to supervise the J.B.M. system installed at the Anchor Hocking
Glass Corporation in Lancaster, Ohio. Then war came along
and I went into the Navy, having six months’ duty in Washing-
ton (1943) and in Philadelphia for the remaining three years.
In January, 1946, I went to work for the Buckeye Steel Castings
Company, where I now have the position of southeastern repre-
sentative, calling on the railroads in that part of the country.

From the above it might appear to be a sort of “hit or miss”
career but I like to believe that the wide variety of friends and
contacts we have so made constitute an invaluable resource.
Because of the great amount of time spent on the road, about
my only extra-curricular activities have consisted of some Junior
Achievement work, a term on the vestry and, when we thought
it the only out, some hard work to reelect Senator Taft. Colum-
bus and my territory seem to be out of the mainstream of Har-
vard traffic and I do miss not having been able to keep in closer
contact with all my good friends of twenty-five years ago.

Gretchen and I, of course, have had our hands full with the
children —no more nor less than others, and would not ex-
change the experience for anything. We spend a lot of time
gardening with moderate success and working around the place.
If I could ever get my golf game in shape, I would play more
than I do. And we have all had several wonderful summer va-
cations at Bridgehampton.

MOST of my work since graduation has been in the field of
mental health, particularly in statistical research about the in-
cidence and outcome of new cases of mental disease. Such basic
facts have long been needed but have been postponed because
of the drudgery involved in searching thousands of records.
Our studies now include over 25,000 consecutive patients. The
papers we have published on our findings have stimulated sim-
ilar research through the country. If only that ancient thief,
Time, will slow up the flight of the years, we shall produce
publications which will be even more useful.

My family is marvelous. I’m sure I don’t know how Mary
Helen, my wife, has put up with me all these years, or how my
children have developed into the paragons they obviously are.
Betsy, Elsa and Lisa, all charming females, perplex me as daugh-
ters have always perplexed fathers. Their individual talents will
shortly startle the entire world, I’m sure. My son, Nelson, Jr.,
is destined to be the Lou Gehrig of 1963; at this writing he is
the dream-boat here of teenage girls for miles around.

My favorite relaxation—for which there is never enough
time —is fishing. The superb trout streams of northwestern
Pennsylvania’s wilderness are pleasure enough; add magnificent
October bass fishing in the upper Allegheny and you have true
Paradise. My wife and children are fishing addicts too — so it’s
a family avocation.

AFTER law school (which was interrupted for several years by
such things as running a boys’ camp in Maine and coaching the
Harvard wrestling teams) and several delightful years in Cam-
bridge, we moved to Tulsa again. I spent three years in the
Lease-Records Department of Barnsdall Oil Company, and three
years as attorney for Case Pomeroy. I then started to practise
law for myself, but could not find office space immediately, and
wound up in Oklahoma City as assistant to the general counsel
of Kerr-McGee. I have been general attorney for that company
for several years. Between drilling rigs in the Gulf, airplanes
and uranium, I have had to get into several different fields of
law in addition to the usual oil and gas Jaw, and it has been
very interesting.

Most of my traveling has been done for the company, to Wash-
ington, D.C., to Louisiana and to New Mexico. However, we
have had several enjoyable trips in Oklahoma, two to Colorado
and one wonderful long one Jast summer. After our second
Colorado trip we bought a stereo camera, and found its full value
this past summer when we went to Yellowstone, Montana (for
the Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Institute), Canada (Banff,
Lake Louise and Kootenay), down through Idaho and Washing-
tun to follow the Columbia River west to Portland, Oregon,
down the West Coast to San Francisco, across through Yosem-
ite, past the Grand Canyon and home again.

We find four teen-agers hard to keep up with. Mary is the
third generation (all Marys) to attend Wellesley; so, at the
moment, she is not under foot. The other three, in the tenth,
ninth and seventh grades respectively at Classen High School,
more than make up for her absence, however.

MY family has been my life career —and a most enjoyable one.
My wife and I have just been blessed with the birth of our
ninth son and thirteenth child. To the initiated this may seem

[ 583 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

like a stupendous, colossal and impossible situation. As a matter
of fact it is! The first question always asked of me (and by
some of my Harvard classmates, too!) is how I can afford
them all—TI really can’t. That is, if I tried in a systematic
way to budget my income over all the necessary expenses it is
just impossible, but some kind genie seems to make up the deficit
each month and we go on and on. The question never asked of
me is how my wife is able to carry on the daily routine and still
keep her sanity. I really don’t know the answer to that — except
that she is the most wonderful person in all God’s creation.

We have little spare time and our hobby is following the ac-
complishments of our children. Mom and I talk of the day
when the pressure of daily life will not be so great and we can
plan such things as trips, vacations and maybe one of those new-
fangled automobiles. But to make that day seem more remote,
Mom’s first thought after the birth of our ninth son was, “We'll
be going to Little League games until we're sixty!”

However, I have had time (it seems impossible) to have been
consistently in various phases of engineering construction. Re-
cently I was associated with an engineering firm on the construc-
tion of the Distant Early Warning System in Labrador. At
present, I am with Stone & Webster Corporation as a construction
cost engineer. All I can say now is I hope the next twenty-five
years don’t bring me as many “blessings” as the last twenty-five.

LOOKING at the Twentieth Report, I see that over the past
five years the essential nature of my activities has not changed,
but I seem to have more to do and somewhat less energy with
which to do it. I am still practising law as a partner in Nutter,
McClennen & Fish in Boston. After many years of planning, a
new Jewish Community Center was constructed here to serve all
age groups, and I am now the president of this agency. Sitting
on the other side of the table, I have been serving on the Budget
Committee of our United Community Services in Boston.

‘Due to advanced age or wisdom, my squash and tennis games
are now of the doubles variety. The string quartet in which I
have played cello for many years is still meeting regularly, and
Tam taking lessons so that I can keep up with it. This year each
of my children made the “big switch” in school— my younger
boy went from elementary to junior high school; his elder
brother from junior high to high school and my daughter from
high schoo] to Wellesley College. At least 1 have one less PTA
meeting to attend!

AFTER three years with B, Altman & Company in New York,
two years with a soybean flour mill there, and a trip to the
West Coast for the fun of it, I came south and engaged in cotton-
seed crushing. I managed to be active in many of the community
organizations. The biggest outside job was heading a bond
election campaign for a new county hospital and then heading
the hospital itself.

Since the Korean War the cotton acreage has steadily declined
in North Carolina, and the crushing business along with it. What
was classified as an essential industry during the war rapidly
became over capacity. Two years ago I stopped operating the
mill but still run a cotton gin, a bonded warehouse, coal, seed
and fertilizer business.

1 married a school teacher in 1945 and my education con-
tinues apace. I don’t know whether my wife, my two daughters

or my favorite pastime of reading is doing the most to further
it.

THERE has been very little time during the past twenty-five
years when I haven’t had something to do with law in one way or
another. First, Harvard Law School, then practice in the law
office of Robert W. Upton of Concord, New Hampshire. After
a year of worthwhile experience in Senator Upton’s office, I
hung out my own shingle in Laconia, New Hampshire, back in
my home town, and continued my practice there until recently,
when I was appointed Associate Justice of the New Hampshire
Superior Court. Even while I served in the Naval Reserve during
the Second World War, I was legal officer on a destroyer tender
in the Pacific, It has always been absorbing and challenging.

I have practised marriage five years less than I have law, having
married Eunice Whittemore in 1938. We have two boys, Dan,
ten, and Tom, eight, who are well on their way to Harvard
College, both presently attending Harvard Street Grammar
School. We are not sure what Dan will become, as he collects
rocks, has a paper route, builds radios, edits “newspapers” and
spends many hours in his boat, but we are sure that Tom will

[591]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933.

become either a crooner, as he sings in his sleep, or a channel
swimmer, as he may be found in, under or around the water at
our community beach any time of day in the summer. Eunice is
apt to become an artist unless antique hunting gets the best of her.
We all like to spend much of our time at our combination winter-
summer home on the shore of Lake Winnisquam where different
projects have kept us busy since 1940.

My appointment as Associate Justice of the New Hampshire
Superior Court was just last March (1957), and a few changes
came over the Keller household at that time. For a few short
days the boys bowed low as I entered the house; however, they
soon returned to their normal rough house. There are seven
Superior Court Judges in New Hampshire who serve ten counties
on different circuits around the State. Each Judge sits in three
or four different counties each year, retirement age is seventy.
The work is hard but very stimulating and interesting.

For outdoor activities, Eunice and I do a little skiing in the
winter and a little golfing in the summer, and excel at neither.

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

MaRRIED: Emily W. Sproule, April 10, 1939.

occuPATION: Editorial group head, advertising agency.

AFTER graduation I started looking for a job in an advertising
agency. But the agencies I talked to weren’t listening. There was
a Depression, all right.

Back home in Rochester, New York, I volunteered my services
on an early-morning radio program and also manned the station’s
switchboard until the regular operator came on. This developed
into a full-time job as announcer and commercial writer.

I finally got an agency job in March, 1934, as a radio com-
mercial writer with the J. Walter Thompson Company in New
York. In time I was writing the commercials for the Rudy
Vallee hour, the Edgar Bergen-Charlie McCarthy show, the
Major Bowes Amateur Hour and other network programs. After
five years of radio, I switched to writing advertising to appear in
magazines and newspapers. I am still with Thompson, to our
mutual surprise, and am now an editorial group head. During
these busy years, I have promoted a wild variety of products
and services. Automobiles, cold cream, coffee. Airliners, cough
syrup, yeast for dogs. Phonograph records. Beer, life insurance.

Farm machines, gasoline, paper towels, The girdle that made a
girl look “‘callipygian.” And many others.

Our apartment is a seven-minute walk from the office, and I.
usually go home for lunch (my wife is a Cordon Bleu cook).
Friday nights, we take off by train and jeep for Putnam Valley,
sixty miles north. There we have a house, thirty-odd acres of
wooded hills with a brook, located on a one-lane dirt road. It’s
a great change from the rush-rush of advertising and Manhattan.
We have been improving the country place, little by little, over
the years. So, from choice and necessity, my weekend activities
are amateur carpentry, house painting, plumbing, forestry and the
like. When there is time, I like to read or play records — mostly
short-hair and low-fi.

My fuzzy vision kept me out of military service during the war.

ACQUIRED an A.M. at Boston College Graduate School to pre-
pare for role as high school teacher of mathematics. The market
being surfeited, some time was devoted to social service work
with various federal agencies and then a spell with the Federal
Treasury Procurement Department. Rebitten by the educational
bug, I accepted (to put it euphemistically ) an appointment as
a junior high school teacher of mathematics in the Boston Public
School system in 1939.

In February of 1946, my four-year stint with the Air Force
ended and the role of sergeant was replaced with that of the
educator. The following April, I was appointed submaster (alias
acting principal) in our system and am currently engaged in the
task of rising above that level. For the past four summers I
have been a guest lecturer in education for the summer sessions
of the Catholic University of America at Washington, D.C.

Mrs. John P. Rattigan of Hyde Park, became my very lovely
bride. Our pride and joy, Mary Margaret, was born on Decem-
ber 1st of the same year. Perhaps what we lack in quantity is
being made up in quality (IQ 168). At any rate, the boundless
interest in and knowledge of astronomy, entomology, etc., make
the teacher of the family feel singularly uneducated.

Following a hernia operation five years ago, I was inoculated
with an antitoxin whose Latin name the surgeon called go-lf.

In 1947 we returned to Cambridge and soon bought the place in
Pepperell so that the children could enjoy country living. Eliza-
beth graduated from Concord Academy and is now married to a

WHAT would normally have been my senior year at Harvard
was spent instead in academic luxury at Trinity College, Cam-
bridge, England. In retrospect, it was a real loss to miss the fourth
year at Harvard, even though the year in England was a rewarding
experience. After Cambridge, England, the Law School seemed
a real salt mine, and an unnecessarily grim preparation for a fas-
cinating profession. From law school I went to Messrs. Shearman
& Sterling in New York City, where, except for the war years, I
have remained ever since.

In the course of work in Texas, while still a bachelor, I took
up flying. Competent navigators were few and far between.
However, back in Cambridge I found Sally Morrison, who not
only took on the navigating but me as well. We have three
children, highly satisfactory to us: our daughter, Tucky, now
fifteen, at Putney School in Vermont; and two sons, Gilbert,
thirteen, and Jonathan, eight, who are still at home with us at
Riverdale.

During the war years I was first in Florida with a Pan American

[ 596 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

unit which was ferrying bombers across the South Atlantic. We
were militarized, and I was taken into the Air Transport Com-
mand, doing special missions and inspection. The closing years of
the war were spent in General Arnold’s office doing Joint and
Combined Chief of Staff work on the Advisory Council.

In 1951, after returning to New York and the law, I became a
member of the firm, now Shearman & Sterling & Wright, 124
lawyers strong (we need more!). We have a good many foreign
clients with interests large and small here and abroad. Acting as
director and officer of a number of our clients’ corporations, I am
intimately involved in their affairs and, consequently, am in the
happy position of being able to apply the law constructively in
their interests. I am also involved with various mining, oil and
gas exploration ventures both here and in Canada,’ All this pro-
duces ups and downs, accompanied by interesting travel, varied
contacts and the charm of the unforeseen.

As a family we have been shuttling from Riverdale in the winter
to Cape Cod in the summer. We continue to find Riverdale a
beautiful country oasis within the limits of the city of New York.
Helping to keep it so has been my principal community activity.
Although this is a satisfying project, its importance recedes in the
post-Sputnik world when larger and imaginative efforts on
worldwide fronts are so urgently needed. We look forward to
the enjoyment of a full and interesting life in New York, inter-
spersed with family cruising and travel (including the June, 1958,
visit to Cambridge), the return of constructive world leadership
under the Democrats in 1960, and to whatever develops down-
town, uptown, around the world and in outer space!

REFLECTION over the years reveals that the course of life for
me since Harvard days was altered by three main “turning points.”
The World War II fracas was the first. The Korean fiasco was
the second. While still engaged in helping the Air Force fran-
tically obligate many billions of its funds during each fiscal period
I was suddenly confronted by the third. This was a serious heart
attack with several extensions and resulted in forced retirement
from the Air Force at the prime age of forty-one.

Thanks to the marvel of modern heart surgery, I am sufficiently
repaired to be able to travel through Europe, South America and
Africa in connection with my small travel business located on the
sunny beach of the Gulf of Mexico.

Unfortunately, I was never blessed with the joy of my own
children. I did, however, acquire a lovely stepdaughter, who 1s
now eighteen, through my second marriage. As to Bette, my
wife and the daughter of Oren Hutchinson Persons, ’16, well —
she is a jewel who insists that living with me these many years
will be well compensated by the opportunity to attend her second
twenty-fifth reunion.

I HAVE never stopped to consider it before; but starting as a
messenger for a brokerage house in 1933 I seem to have followed
an odd and circuitous route through a variety of jobs'to arrive at
my present job on the Bench. There has certainly been a lot of
waste time and motion in the process — but 1 in terms of activity,
excitement, friendships gained and extensive ‘experience among
many kinds of people, looking back — it all seems worthwhile. (I
also served three years in the Navy in World War II in the
Pacific.)

My family absorb most of my time and interest apart from my
work. I love the out of doors and have never lost my great interest
in all forms of athletics and I still play a little tennis (the middle-
age variety), golf and I go fishing as often as my wife gives me
permission.

After a pretty fair exposure to the problem, I harbor an in-
creasing fear that so many of our more able citizens are so absorbed
in making a buck that the direction of public affairs is being left,
for the most part, to second and third raters. Taking ten seconds
to draw a check for a campaign contribution is a poor substitute
for active citizenship. To keep healthy a republic like ours re-
quires more effort and applied idealism than most of us are willing
to give to it. I just hope that the roof doesn’t fall in before we
wake up. ,

DURING the summer and fall of 1933 I became a farm hand at
ten cents per hour plus board and room in the desert of south-
eastern Utah. Money was worth something then, my wants were
few, and I enjoyed life. I even had a few dollars in my pocket
that fall when I returned home and got a job in a warehouse
handling sugar. This was so lucrative that after a couple of
months I took a trip to Memphis purely for pleasure.

Upon my return I came with our present company as a real
estate salesman. Now when I look at the real estate we sold in
those days, I wonder why we weren't buying instead of selling,

[ 600 |

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

but that brings up the matter of money again . . . Our insurance
salesman left us and I moved into his job until I decided civilian
life was not for me and joined the Army in the spring of 1943.
The Army took me on a conducted tour of Ireland, England and
western Europe and I’m certain I had a much softer life than
civilians did during that period, My only regret is that our
congressmen didn’t seem to realize this, and were outdoing each
other in an effort to make a favored class of the veteran. In due
course I was discharged and returned to our company as secretary-
treasurer and advanced to vice-president and manager a few years
ago.

There are those who would say that I have become much more
proficient at fishing, hunting and skiing. during my business
career, but then when you live in Salt Lake City where these
things are so near, what else would a fellow do? I have done
some work for the Episcopal Church as finance chairman of a
drive to raise enough money to build a small building for our new
parish. Politically I have been in the minority for these many
years and still seem to be in that group, since I had hoped for more
changes in thinking than have taken place. I can’t become re-
signed to big government and am fearful of it.

puBiications: “Preliminary Report on the Smithsonian Institution — Har-
vard University Archaeological Expedition to Northwestern Honduras,
1936.” with W. D. Strong and A, J. D. Paul, 1938; “Some Early Sites in
the Northern Lake Titicaca Basin,” 1943; “Archaeology of North-
western Venezuela,” 1944.

I HAVE written in a previous report about my early field trips
to Venezuela, Honduras, Peru and Bolivia. Lately, in 1955, my
wife and I made a long study in Bolivia and a short one across
Lake Titicaca, in southern Peru. It was the first real field trip,
complete with excavation, that we have had together since
1939, and was most productive of information on pre-Tia-
huanaco life on the south shore of Titicaca. Such trips are the
heart and soul of archeology, but we have, for various reasons,
been able to make so few of them. Perhaps this is just as well,
for I still have a large backlog of writing to finish before I allow
myself another one.

Since leaving Cambridge for Philadelphia, to help run a large
and very active museum, my three dreary years of incarceration
in the Pentagon have paid off in more than a few foreign dec-
orations bestowed because I happened to have a hand in training
programs for foreign governments. Having never administered
anything, I found that I could, and so gained a lot of confidence
in that line which I find very valuable. After the war, I spent
four years in intensive teaching, including tutorial. Now, I de-
vote a great deal of time to museum administration teaching only
about a half-course a year. In both situations, field research
and writing have suffered, but I am not alone in this squeeze,
so characteristic of academic life in this and other countries.

I have also been involved in TV — “What in the World?”,
an anthropological quiz show that was on the CBS Network for
four years and has been revived locally. This takes a minimum
of time. Not so my connection with the International Congress
of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences, on which, as
scerctary general and chairman of local arrangements, I spent

the better part of 1956. But, we did have a fine Congress in
Philadelphia.

Looking backward, I don’t regret the possibly excessive time
I spent on students in Cambridge. They have been great credits

to me and to Harvard. Our happiest times have been on field
trips and fishing trips. The latter sport is my only real hobby
(an archeologist doesn’t need, or have time for others). We are
hopefully remodelling a medium-sized stable in Devon, Pennsyl-
vania, and expect to be living there for a long time. When in-
stalled, the 1810 door from old Wister house in Germantown
will be kept oiled to swing wide for all Classmates.

SINCE I can’t imagine the story of my life being of interest to
any but the members of my immediate family, I should prefer
to let the foregoing statistics speak for themselves. However,
presuming that at least a minimum amount of space has been
allotted to each class member I will make a stab at factual report-
ing without attempting to match the lyrical quality reflected in
the reports of so many of our classmates.

Shortly after graduation, I joined my father in the steel fab-
ricating business in Indiana. His untimely death resulted even-
tually in the sale of the company and I embarked upon a career
of advertising and sales promotion which took me from Indiana
to Toledo, Ohio, Tulsa, Oklahoma, Chicago and finally to Chat-
tanooga. Virginia, another native Hoosier, and I were married
in 1937 and despite our rather nomadic life, we were successful
in establishing a fine family of three children, two sons and a
daughter.

At this writing, Dick, the elder son, is a sophomore at the
University of Illinois, majoring in Architectural Engineering;
John is in the Air Force, based at Keesler A.F.B. at Biloxi, Mis-
sissippi, determined to make the Air Force his career; and Sue
is enjoying the eighth grade at Girls Preparatory School here
in Chattanooga.

Although we moved to Chattanooga only eighteen months
ago, the family is already well established and unusually happy;
despite the fact that we are still considered “damn yankees.” In
fact, we are convinced, should any further moves be necessary,
they will be still farther south. We live atop Lookout Mountain,
looking out over the valley, 1200 feet below. We are entranced
with the country and the people, but the economic and cul-
tural opportunities still leave something to be desired and the
term “Civil War” is still taboo.

Throughout these twenty-five years we have enjoyed par-
ticularly good health and have been fortunate to have shared

in the economic growth of the country, despite the inauspicious
beginnings characteristic of the mid-thirties. Also, I have been
able to engage almost continuously in my favorite pastime —
golf — and am still blessed with sufficient youth to shoot in the
70's, although we are finding it becoming more like work almost
month by month, Although we haven’t had the pleasure of
returning to Cambridge as often as we should have liked, we
have many pleasant memories of the four years at Harvard and
we are looking forward to reviving those memories at the Twen-
ty-fifth Reunion.

TWENTY-FIVE years have passed, some good, some bad, but
all have left their memories. I was turned loose onto the Amer-
ican industrial scene; my head stuffed to the bursting with as-
sorted knowledge; my ego puffed to the limit; I, the callow
young man, would soon be working miracles on the industrial
front. But, alas, the dreams disappeared in a puff of smoke;
none would hire me. Despair was rampant and the tomorrow
bleak. Since that day, I have watched our country become its
natural buoyant self until now. The cycle once again repeats
itself. Gloom again stalks the land. “Sputnik” and the Russian
threat of scientific and technological superiority has the public
and most of my friends in a defeatist mood.

Having received my degree in civil engineering, I worked at
many odd jobs in this field until I went into the textile business

[ 605 ]

with my father in 1935. Shortly after my marriage I went into
business for myself. This did not last long, because, along came
the war and I was drafted into the ranks of the engineers. I
became a practising mechanical engineer. I have remained in
this field, specializing in the design of automatic machinery,
and have returned to school from time to time for special
courses.

In the meantime, my two sons were born. The elder con-
tracted rheumatic fever at the age of nine and lost out on many
boyish activities. But he has compensated for a minor heart
murmur with an avid interest in Scouting and sailing. But it was
the health of my younger son that gave us the most trouble and
worry. He needed constant care and attention because of
asthma. Finally, in October, 1955, after a particularly bad attack,
I swore that a change of climate was what he needed. So we
moved from a comfortable niche in Newton to California. It’s
the best thing we ever have done. We love it here and his asthma
has practically disappeared. I am still at it, designing machinery,
amazed that I didn’t discover my special talent until I was almost
thirty years of age. I love my work so much that it has become
my avocation. With the exception of the local social life and
a bit of teaching at Orange Coast Junior College, I do little be-
side study and read technical journals relating to my profession.

HOME AND OFFICE ADDRESS: Spruce Pond Inn and Motel, R.F.D. 2, Stowe, Vt.

BORN: Oct. 20, 1910, Johannesburg, South Africa. parents: John Wilkinson
Kirkland, Elena Hellmann.

PREPARED AT: Mill Hill School, London, England.

MARRIED: Elsbeth A. Ruppe, Jan. 7, 1943, New York, N.Y. cHiLpren: Elsie
Lois, Nov. 12, 1943; John Wilkinson, Jr., June 11, 1945.

OCCUPATION: Owner-Manager, resort motel and inn.

BEFORE I went to Harvard in 1929, I had already traveled ex-
tensively. My schooling sounded like a Cook’s tour — or a little
boy’s nightmare: Johannesburg, South Africa; West Newton,
Massachusetts; Johannesburg again; Switzerland; a couple of
schools in England and, finally, Harvard. Something of it seems
to have stayed with me, for up to just recently, I still had not
settled.

Just two years ago, Elsbeth, Lisa, John, Jr., and myself decided
on a change. We had just returned from Ethiopia where I had
been stationed as Economics Attaché in the U.S. Embassy. Look-
ing into the future, we could see little ahead but more travel. I
remembered only too well my own reactions when young to the
constant changing of schools and countries — and had seen what
it did to some of the few friends I had kept up with who had
gone through the same experiences. I didn’t want to submit my
own two children to it. Despite being a citizen of the world, one
gets the sad feeling of fitting nowhere.

For better or worse, we decided to make a big break and to
manage our own lives in the future. Elsbeth had spent most of her
childhood vacations in southern Vermont and loved its people
and the country. We decided to buy a resort hotel, or ski lodge.
On investigation, we discovered that if it was the ski business we
were interested in in the East, then Stowe was the place because
its snow is the most reliable. Searching still further, we were
strongly advised against going into anything which depended on
just one season, The next startling nugget unearthed was that to
have a two-season business, it would be necessary to own a motel,
for in the summer (and increasingly so in the winter) the con-
veniences of a motel attract not only those “over-nighters” but
also those who wish to stay a while.

[ 607 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933
«

We soon found out that our old-fashioned notions of motels
were considerably outmoded; that the good ones are more fastidi-
ously furnished and equipped than many of the better hotels,
that. they attract the very nicest people, that there is nothing inex-
pensive about them, and that to succeed, fantastically high
standards must be maintained.

In Stowe, we found just what we were looking for; a beautifully
landscaped motel on one side of the road (complete with a
swimming and skating pond) and a huge old rambling Vermont
farmhouse on the other side. We bought them both immediately
and converted the old farm buildings into a lovely inn. So now we
are the proud and overworked owners of a resort-type motel
and inn. The idea of just renting rooms (a typical motel opera-
tion) had no appeal, so we added a restaurant of which Elsbeth
is the mistress — though no longer the cook. It may be too soon
to say that our fame is established — but certainly it is growing.
We have made some wonderful friends, entertained and fed a vast
number of people. Our various crises, mechanical and otherwise,
could fill a book. Maybe they will one day.

Vermont is still unspoiled, uncommercialized, beautiful, rugged
and cold. Stowe is the best of all these things. We sometimes
miss the activity of Washington, but never the weather. The
children are growing up in a healthy community, are expert
skiers, skaters, riders, hikers, walkers, scouts and swimmers, And
we have found decided advantages in running a family enterprise.
It makes for a family “oneness” difficult otherwise to achieve.

As I look back on the last twenty-five years I don’t regret my
varied activities — prospector in Tanganyika and Swaziland, im-
porter in South Africa, newspaper reporter in Boston (Tans-
cript), oil company representative in the Belgian Congo and Ivory
Coast, school teacher at Mount Hermon, Massachusetts, govern-
ment work, and finally, two years of “diplomacy” in Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia. But I am the living proof of the old adage that
the rolling stone gathers no moss.

Arteriosclerotic Heart Disease, Pericarditis, Cardiac Arrhythmias and
several interesting case reports.

FOLLOWING my graduation from Harvard, I was fortunate
enough to get into a Grade A medical school at Boston University.
The next four years were full of hard work but still plenty of fun
in spite of it all, Then came an internship at the Massachusetts
Memorial Hospitals, a residency at the Haynes Memorial Hospital,
finally capped by a rewarding research fellowship from Harvard
Medical School, in internal medicine. This was spent in the
Medical Research Department at the Beth Israel Hospital in
Boston. There finally came a glorious, anxious day in January,
1940, when I opened my office in Stoneham, Massachusetts. This
was followed by the inevitable long wait for my first patient —
I won’t mention how long. Just as I was getting rolling in 1942,
Uncle Sam came along with his compelling, beckoning finger and
I must say that I looked resplendent in the uniform of a first
lieutenant, M.C., A.U.S. Then came thirty-nine months of relative
insecurity, considerable travel, a stroke of good fortune with ad-
ditional training at the Mayo Foundation and wonder of wonders

[ 609 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

— good medical assignments. I came out a major, no medals, no
combat experiences and thrilled to get back home to resume an in-
terrupted career. My period of army service enabled me to
qualify for the practice of internal medicine and in 1945 I passed
the Board of Internal Medicine. Setting up in practice again as a
specialist had its anxious moments, but the ball soon was rolling
and now, twelve years later, I am an accepted internist and
cardiologist. In 1948 I was elected a fellow of the American
College of Physicians, and in 1955 I was honored with a fellow-
ship in the American College of Cardiology.

However, life wasn’t and isn’t all medicine. In 1939 I married
Berenice Gelfand after a whirlwind courtship of some ten years.
I must say that it was the smartest thing I did as she has been a
wonderful and patient helpmate during our trials and tribulations.
We have a well-balanced family of two boys and two girls and
suffered the tragedy of losing a little girl, Our oldest, Sheila, will
graduate from high school in 1958 and hopes to enter college in
the fall of that year. Our second child and elder son, Jeremy, is
now a junior in high school, a husky football player, who hopes
to enter Harvard in 1959. Paul and Amy, our younger family, are
in the grade school but manage to make themselves heard.

Being a gregarious animal, medicine and a wonderful wife and
family were not enough to round out my life. I have, therefore,
become quite involved in communal affairs. Immediately after
the war, my wife and I organized the local Jewish families into a
community center unit and founded a religious school for our
children to supplement their public school education, This has
grown into a Temple with its own building and classrooms, and
I had the privilege and honor of leading and heading our Com-
munity Center from 1947 to 1953. I also found myself enmeshed
in the drive for better schools, aided in our citizens’ drive for a
new high school and ended up by being a member of the high
school building committee. This led me into the problem of

youth activities and recreation and I find myself now at the head
of the Stoneham Community Council with the responsibility of
welding the efforts of all our civic and religious groups into a
productive whole.
What else is there to say? Who has had time for hobbies?
Golf and I are strangers. I bow] once in a while, but I still carry

on an avid interest in baseball, professional of course, and college
football. I try to stay abreast of current affairs and I feel that if
we can only keep our heads, no amount of Russian technological
achievements can bring us to our knees, I subscribe to the late
Franklin D. Roosevelt’s thesis that “all we have to fear is fear
itself.” If only we can recapture our faith in ourselves, we can
reach any heights. Regardless of our present anxieties and in-
securities, Harvard Reunions will go on.

QUITE frankly, I entered Harvard after two years at the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin because at the time there seemed to be
enough money in the family till — and I left Harvard a year later
because there wasn’t. I was there just barely long enough to
learn a few bars of “Fair Harvard,” say “Hello” to President
Lowell as he was walking his dog in the Yard, smoke a few
packages of Cake Box and find my way to the Old Howard where
I was a night student. Still, the place has had a lasting magic —
the sunlight streaming over the Yard lawns on autumn afternoons;
the snow piled against the lamp posts on wintry nights; Professor
Merriman bringing the clang and color of the Armada into
Harvard Hall, “Copey” (though emeritus) talking with crackling
wit with the windows wide open in weather that must have been
below zero. All of these are unforgettable.

Like hundreds of others, I went from Harvard into as tough a
time as ex-collegians have ever faced. Did I have a job? I had
fifty jobs, one right after the other. And none were heroic, or
ennobling, or particularly educational. I had a head start at it,
but I met the Class of ’33 stacking books in public libraries, work-

Harvard ’33 is haunted.

MEMBER OF: College English Association; New England Association for
American Studies; American Studies Association.

PUBLICATIONS: Various articles in M.1.T. Review, 1938-42; some reviews in

IN 1933 I accepted a position in the English Department at
Oglethorpe University, Georgia, leaving after three years, the
last as acting head of the department. I then joined the Depart-
ment of English and History at M.I.T., spent one year as an ex-
change professor at the Case School of Applied Science in Cleve-
land, and in 1943 left M.I-T. to teach in the English A Department
at Harvard, and simultaneously to work on my doctorate in the
history of American civilization, a long-delayed project. After
completing my residence requirements I moved on to Boston Uni-
versity, where I now am.

Previous to our marriage, my fiancée spent a year abroad on a
musical scholarship. We were married on her return in 1939 and
now have two daughters, who have certainly added greatly to our
lives. My wife, besides raising a family, has taught at the New
England Conservatory of Music since our marriage and is now
director of the Preparatory Department there, a congenial career,
since one of my hobbies has been music.

A couple of trips to Europe between wars, various sports as
well as music for hobbies, now mostly golf, and summers in
Maine, except for one in the West, constitute the pattern of our
lives. Both my wife and I have really devoted our lives to teach-

ing.

BACK in 1933, I was bound and determined I was going to
earn my way by writing, this despite the fact that Bernard
DeVoto, in one of the best courses I had in college, had said: “If
you are going to write, get another kind of job to earn your
living.” I apprenticed for a while on the Christian Science Mon-
itor, then left that paper and began pounding out stories and
getting nowhere fast except for a few magazine articles and some
Space-rate material. In desperation, with the advice of a friendly
linotype operator, I printed a little brochure about myself and
sent it out to a number of newspapers. It produced results and

[ 618 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

I became the low man on the Hartford (Connecticut) Courant

totem pole, editing letters to the editor, a humorous (?) column,

a poet's column (now and then penning a piece of doggerel to

my wife-to-be), and eventually worked into editorials on local

government. It was about that time that I co-authored a book,

The Complete Swimmer, with Hal Ulen, Harvard swimming

coach. It was the first of a series of swimming books that coaches

have brought out, and we still think it was the best.

Hartford was a rewarding experience in terms of personal
association, expanding political, economic and social thinking,
and independent bachelorhood. By some law of counter-reac-
tion, I, a conservative New England Republican, became due
to my job on a most conservative New England newspaper, a
liberal in thought, word and deed. This has worn down through
the years into a kind of independent neutralism in politics, and
a far less dogmatic and argumentative approach to everything.
In 1937, I married the Hartford Courant society editor, an intel-
ligent, attractive girl named Helen Stafford who had no use
for highbrow editorial writers, and who turned out to have
a passion for baseball and boxing.

In Hartford, while covering City Hall and local government,
I had the feeling that I would rather be doing than writing.
An outstanding businessman-administrator turned me to public
administration and more than anything else, sold me on the field
of government. I thus branched out in 1939 into a field of activity
I never knew existed when I was in college. Meeting up with
some of the hardworking, trained, young career administrators
working in the housing agencies in Washington, I moved along
in several jobs of increasing responsibility, all interesting if some-
times frustrating. The ivory tower man had to become a down-
to-earth operator in the field of negotiations, budgets and de-

cisions. This is probably where I should have started when I
left Harvard.

We lived in Washington in 1940, and I still remember saving
money on $3,800 a year. Our first daughter, Linda, was born
there. From 1942 to 1944, as a sort of general manager of hous-
ing at Willow Run, Michigan, I guess I ran the gamut of every
conceivable situation ten or twelve thousand transients in tem-
porary wartime living conditions can create: disputes, food

,

[ 619 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

strikes, sex and violence — in spite of which the job was accom-
plished. In contrast, my stint in the Navy was relaxed except
for a brief, solid period of service as executive officer of a mil-
itary government unit in the Pacific.

Government was a different thing after the war — more polit-
ical, less dedicated, and old triumphs were dead ones. In 1947,
I took my family, two daughters now, from Lexington, Massa-
chusetts, to Cleveland, to tackle a wholly new experience as
director of the Citizens League and Bureau of Governmental
Research. In terms of friends, good times and successes, this
city has been a second home to us. The League was a Cleveland
institution, a citizens’ reform organization of many years stand-
ing, and it was the director’s job to channel business and civic
leadership into improved local and county government. I can
fairly say that it was one of those happy unions of job and man,
and this civic-minded city pushed me and my family prominently
into public life. I still cherish Resolution No. 191-53 of the
Cleveland City Council stating that “the role of a professional
provocator precludes popularity, but it is admitted by this Coun-
cil that the chastisements from Guy C. Larcom, Jr., were in the
light of constructive advice rather than destructive castigations.”

Man is never content, so I left this rewarding job for a couple
of years as executive vice-president of a firm of architects and
engineers to get a taste of private enterprise and big money. I
got the former but not the latter.

In April, 1956, I came to Ann Arbor, where I am now man-
ager of this fine city of about 60,000 people. Problems of traffic,
public works, water and sewer expansion and the like keep me
going night and day and Sundays— there seems to be no such
thing as routine in this work — and when the big issues are not
bulking large, then the phone rings daily on small matters of
infinite concern to each individual taxpayer. An interesting
feature of this job is the task of working cooperatively with the
University of Michigan.

I would say the best thing in my life has been my marriage
which has given me a wife whose personality and intelligence
have more than anything else made my life a balanced, happy
one and who in turn has given me two charming, attractive
daughters. At this late date we find another child close to being

[ 620 ] ‘

born. As I look back on them, all of my jobs have been interest-
ing, and I feel worthwhile, some may have even contributed to
the better life; I am reconciled to working hard for a living
with no rest and little leisure and no big bonuses or surplus prof-
its. I can’t say too much for the pleasures of working and living
in a college community such as Ann Arbor.

I LEFT Harvard early (and the grandstands at Fenway Park and
Braves Field with it) because of an impulse to write for a living,
which soon afterward became a need and later a positive scourge.
Nothing has deflected me from this course since then, even when
I pined for deflection.

I worked very briefly for the Paris Herald, then for three years
as a general reporter for the New York Herald Tribune. In 1933
I became a syndicated daily sports columnist, and in 1939 (and
ever after) a kind of half-sober pundit and columnist for News-
week magazine. I covered the Second World War as a correspon-
dent for newspapers, Newsweek and the New Yorker, in every
theatre they could prod me into, including Australia, New Guinea,
North Africa, Sicily, Italy, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Subsequently,
and at present, I am working mainly for Newsweek and for the
New Yorker (as a drama critic and left-handed trick-shot artist).
I have collected, that is, gathered together, a book now and then,

I have a wife, one daughter in the class of 1960 at Swarthmore

who is going stubbornly forward.

consuming task, but with our Twenty-fifth Reunion approaching
we are all looking forward to reading those of our classmates, so
here goes.

During depression years my most successful accomplishment
was to be married and have two sons. Meanwhile, several occupa-
tions were attempted without much success. In 1938 I became
associated with the paper manufacturing business at the Crocker
Burbank Mills in Fitchburg. Have remained in the paper industry
since that time, with four years out for service as a non-flying
officer during World War IT. Recently a long standing desire to
acquire an interest in my present company has been accomplished.

We have settled in the delightful Connecticut Valley village of
South Hadley to be near the paper business in Holyoke. Our
elder boy has completed his service with the Marine Corps and
plans to return to Trinity College. Our younger son is presently
a junior at Harvard where by coincidence he is living in my old
House — Eliot.

The quiet country life is for us, we like to sail and ski as much

as possible, and someday hope to travel a little when our sons
have graduated.

A WINTER or so ago, at an unlikely hour, I dashed on a train
about to leave Grand Central, scrambled for a seat, and settled
into it without giving much thought to my seatmate. He smiled

[ 624]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

genially, however, and I applied myself diligently to pencil and
paper work at hand. Shortly, my seat companion volunteered, “]
know you . . . Were you in the Navy?” I wasn’t, but it finally
came out we were at Harvard together. Harvard, °33!

1933 —- that was a year to come out into the world! I thought
I knew what I wanted to do for a living — social work .. . But
at least I didn’t become a client of one of the agencies. Had quite
a bit of fun, in fact. And I had learned during the previous couple
of years in Cambridge to turn my hand to many kinds of work.

Married, after three long years of waiting to afford it, while
on a temporary job — and count it as one of my achievements —
our achievements — to have made a happy “go” of it for some
twenty years now.

Vocationally, the “new era” came with World War II, when
I entered war work as a lathe operator and later became an in-
structor in foreman training — followed by almost ten years
with Ford Motor Company in industrial relations, a year in hotel
personnel work, and now back in industry — employment,
training, and salary administration.

I joined the First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, the
month of our graduation, and church work has always been a
central focus of interest and activity for both my wife and my-
self, helping to enrich our experience with purposeful off-the-
job activity and many fun-filled and lasting friendships. In fact,
church work is for practical purposes our hobby — other than
home-making.

What was once almost a hobby in the more usual sense was a
little résumé-writing service I had back in 1939— until doing
two jobs was too much. Today, however, I have the satisfac-
tion of seeing that this kind of vocational counseling and job-
getting assistance is offered professionally in many of our major
Cities.

Our Twenty-fifth Reunion is certainly an appropriate inven-
tory-taking time, and I guess we are all asking ourselves: What
are my objectives in life and how successful am I in reaching
or approaching them?

In thinking it over as I write this, I realize that I have been
pretty much of an opportunist, at least career-wise, but that I

[ 625 ]

have endcavored somewhat to heed Paul’s admonition to think
on those things which are true, honest, just, pure, lovely and of
good report. “To so think consistently 1 is doubtless an unreacha-
ble goal, but to endeavor to do so more consistently, expressed
in constructive, intelligent activity, is not—and promises to
provide a lifetime challenge!

IN September, 1929, I started an engineering degree which I

about to put to test for the first time. Draw your own conclu-
sions.

Life has been very happy and normal, in my interpretation,
for the Lees family. The twenty-five-year interval may appear
somewhat prosaic in retrospect, but it has included a lot of fun!

My first job, as salesman for the Armstrong Cork Company,
was in New York and lasted until 1 donned the blue uniform
as a licutcnant (j.g.). The next two and one-half years, spent
mainly as a “landlocked sailor,” weren't very gratifying or stimu-
lating, and the long separations from wife, children and home
were discouraging, to say the Icast. Travel was interesting and
1 probably set a new record for rail travel for naval personnel

[ 626 ]

as I spent forty-five nights of my first year’s service in Pullmans,
coaches and “‘boxcars.”

So much for the naval “career.” About two weeks after V-J
Day, I was sitting on the bridge of LST 392 in Pearl Harbor,
when I received a letter which resulted in my entry into the
carpet business, for my second business association since 1934.
Now I travel again, and while it’s the Beverly-Hilton instead of
the pre-Civil War hotel in Ottawa, Illinois, “Red Carpet Serv-
ice” instead of the troop train from Norfolk to Port Hueneme,
occasional trips such as the Americana in Bal Harbour and the
Capri in Havana to “dedicate” our carpet installations, —I still
prefer home!

Weekends in Princeton are active, particularly during the fall
and winter sports seasons. We love our community — have lived
here with the mixture of “eggheads,” hot jazz enthusiasts, com-
muters, opinion researchers, educational testers, the Scotch and
bourbon set (may be some duplication here!) since 1947. Un-
fortunately for my Harvard background, I find myself pretty
fond of the local “old school tie,” and even root enthusiastically
for the Tiger teams (except when they play the Crimson!).

Re-reading the above, it doesn’t sound like much action for
twenty-five years, but it has included and still contains a lot of
happiness. Anne and I have three wonderful, lovely, little ladies.
The oldest is now at Shipley and may be headed for Radcliffe.
My job is a good one, — interesting and stimulating. Note my
birth-date and see why I call myself “Lucky.”

Next stop is “Age sixty-five” when I plan to head for a warmer
climate — better plan the Fiftieth in the South Seas!

AFTER graduation I went on to Columbia Law School and
received my law degree there in 1936. Since then, I’ve been in
partnership with my father— except during the years 1942-45,
when I had jobs with the Army Signal Corps and Air Corps.

I couldn't in any sense of the word be called a “success.”
Either by the standard of the amount of money I’ve made, or
the recognition gained for achievement in any particular field,
I can’t claim even a passing grade.

[ have no doubr that the time is out of joint— much more
badly out of joint than most other times — but I don’t have the
notion that I was born to set it right. By this I don’t mean that
I regard the world’s troubles with the indifference that was once
supposed to be the hallmark of the Harvard man. I just don’t
see anything effective that I can do to help straighten the world
out, and so I do nothing. This makes me indistinguishable from
the people who either don’t care or don’t realize that mankind
has gotten too big for its breeches, and that the world we know
is liable to blow up in our faces any day.

All of which sounds very much out of place in a Twenty-fifth
Anniversary Class Report. The fact is that we can only live
from day to day —and daily living has been rewarding to me.
The small, simple pleasures of home and family add up, over the
years, to an impressive total. To sum it up, life has been a lot
berter for me than I ever expected back in 1933.

INITIALLY, I looked forward to preparing a brief autobio-

this as a pleasant chore. While so engrossed 1 came upon a bit

The century’s no longer new;

The years to come seem very few.

Twenties and thirties, forties gone,

And now the fifties rumble on...

No use to grumble or repine,

The century’s in its decline.
This unsettled me because I am so intimately involved in this
decline. Thus, I am barely making the deadline.

Following graduation, I attended Law School and enjoyed
Cambridge for an additional three years. My choice of law was
dictated primarily by the futile economic trend of the times.
Following another graduation I specialized in bankruptcy law
with a large firm in New York City. After a short period of
inadequate compensation, I enthusiastically gave up the practice
of law and began the task of becoming a self-made business man.

In 1940, I visited San Francisco in order to see the Fair on
Treasure Island. This visit was to have a two-fold significance
on my life. First, I met the girl who is now my wife; secondly,
by registering for the draft in San Francisco, I unduly prolonged
my military career in that I received a quick call to active duty
shortly after Pearl Harbor. My military service represented a
pleasant interlude of idleness of almost four years while stationed
in San Francisco and assigned to Recruiting and Induction of
WACS. The only noteworthy military accomplishment was a

[ 629 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

letter of commendation pertaining to an idea as to X-ray holders
which would have resulted in the saving of millions of dollars
but unfortunately could not be used because it infringed upon
a patent of Westinghouse.

It was during this period of time that I became accustomed to
a slower tempo of living. I also found a greater appreciation
for leisure time. It was inevitable that following my discharge
I would return to law as a career. I was admitted to practice in
California.

From 1946 to 1952, I was a referee with the California Un-
employment Insurance Appeals Board. In addition thereto |
had my own law practice and also harvested walnuts from a
seventy-acre grove. In 1953, I was appointed secretary to the
Appeals Board in Sacramento, California. After a few months,
I resigned in order to pursue graduate study of law at the Univer-
sity of Southern California. I completed approximately two-
thirds of the requirements for an LL.M. degree when the infla-
tionary spiral caused still another change in plans. In 1954, I
was appointed Referee of the California Industrial Accident
Commission and am presently performing the judicial functions
of this position. I am engaged in private practice.

My family and I thoroughly enjoy living in Southern Califor-
nia. Garden Grove, the city in which we live, was three years
ago an unincorporated area of a few thousand. Today, it is an
established city of fifty thousand. Living in such a fast-growing
area affords unique opportunities for community service.

My wife and I have been active in everything from PTA to
the Community Symphony. My greatest satisfaction has come
from the work done in helping to organize a Jewish Community
Center and serving as its president. It may be of interest to those
in this wide, wide world to know that a Harvard Club of Orange
County is being formed and that there are approximately eighty

Harvard men living in this area.

Our three children, Gail, Ronald and Robin, with their varied
and hectic activities have driven me out into the garden and it
is not surprising that gardening has become my chief hobby. A
begonia in full bloom gives me as much pleasure as a golf score

in close proximity to par. Our children are ambitious students
and call upon me to help them with science and mathematics.

THE direction of a man’s life is changed by many things, large
and small. In the summer of 1931 my youngest brother became
critically ill and passed away. Dad’s business was at its lowest
ebb. I had returned to Cambridge after a summer spent partly
on the Continent of Europe, playing piano with a dance band.
I had a lot of time on the voyage home to do some deep thinking
and self analysis.

Hence, in September, I enrolled at Middlesex University Col-
lege of Medicine and Surgery and in due course was granted the
degree of Doctor of Podiatry. Since 1933 I have practised Podia-
try in Rockland, Massachusetts. In 1946 I did postgraduate

remember running into a single classmate during the whole war.

My spare time and vacations are spent skiing en famille, some

golf and tennis.

I feel quite fortunate in the way life has treated me so far, and
if the world would simmer down to a peaceful existence, I could
look forward to a happy future.

OccuPATION: General sales manager, Mosaic Tile Company.

MEMBER OF: Harvard Varsity Club; Sigma Alpha Epsilon; Zanesville Country

AFTER graduation I lost no time in looking for a job. The
going was rough and the changes frequent. The first three
years were really Commencement. They included a stint in a
brokerage, selling insurance, and a year of teaching history and
economics at the Manhus Military Academy in up-state New
York, I finally became a cost accountant for American Home
Products Corporation, and, while so employed, met Joanne, later
to become my wife. I seemed to take to this work and a year
later became branch manager at Windsor, Ontario. A year later,
after returning to the U.S., I found it advantageous to go to
work for Bemis Brothers Bag Company, as a salesman. Mar-
riage followed soon after and it has been a very happy one.
When Harris arrived in 1941, we little dreamed that war was
to follow thereafter. My birthday that year was memorable
since it fell as usual on December seventh. The need for new
types of packaging to meet our war needs led me into the re-
search end of our business, I traveled widely throughout the
country and was home very little. After the war, I became in-
volved in quality control work, and left the East to take up the
duties involved in St. Louis. Two years later I was called back
to Massachusetts, to fill sales management responsibilities, This
lasted five years from 1950 on. Highlight of this period was
a second son, Curtis, who arrived in 1953. In January, 1955, I
was named manager of the Bemis Tekmold Products Plant in
Minneapolis. This was a diversification effort in the molded pulp
field. Like many efforts of this kind, it pursued a wobbly course.

[ 635 ]

It was necessary to return it to Research for further development
work in the current year. About this time, I had an opportunity
to join the Mosaic Tile Company which I felt I should accept.
Accordingly, after nineteen very pleasant and very educational
years, I tendered my resignation and started anew on September
3, 1957. Lam thoroughly absorbed and happy in the new venture.

Currently, our elder boy is a junior at the Lawrence Academy
in Groton, Massachusetts. Secundus is finishing nursery school
and is looking forward to “big school.” We have just com-
pleted our sixth major move in the last nineteen years, so Joanne
is busy with all of the problems involved in the change. Since
graduation, I have made twelve major moves, six before mar-
riage. We expect the next one to be toward the Sputnik area.
During the years I have been fortunate in being able to get to
various class functions and reunions. I am looking forward to
our Twenty-fifth. The spare time, what little there is, seems
to be easily and quickly occupied by a host of activities, most
of which seem to fall in the “do-it-yourself” category or that
of driving the kids to their never-dwindling list of “must” ap-
pointments. Believe it or not, I enjoy it.

After twenty-five years it is fair to evaluate what Harvard
means to me. Was it worth it? My answer is: “Sure it was,
every bit of it.” I gained from Harvard far more than my hard-
working and sacrificing parents ever paid out in cost. The benefits
are beyond price. I hope my own boys can make it. If they do, I
hope they can take from it as much as I did, and a little bit more.

IT is somewhat shocking to realize that twenty-five years have
elapsed since graduation from college. Life seems to be just be-
ginning, Perhaps this feeling is due to the nature of my work.
Surgeons seem to get started so late in life.

Graduation from college was really just the beginning of a
long period of preparation. First, four more years at Harvard,
but now across the river on Longfellow Avenue at the Medical
School. It’s difficult to decide which makes the greater impres-
sion, the College with its introduction to learning, scholarship
and knowledge, or the Medical School, where training in one
discipline is brought to as near perfection as the limits of time
and human frailties will permit. Medical school was followed
by an internship at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. It
was here that I became acutely aware that the sum of man’s
learning, although finite, is prodigious. Again graduation was
but the beginning of another period of learning and training.
Emphasis was now on techniques and applications; the art of
medicine. Hospital work continued until interrupted by the
war.

July, 1943, saw me on my way to Camp Lee, Virginia, and
then to Camp Rucker in Alabama. Again training, learning and
teaching; more mundane arts related to immediate personal and
group survival. We lectured to ourselves, marched, taught coal
miners and farmers the rudiments of first aid, nursing and
laboratory techniques. After nine months some doctors, some
nurses, and a motley group of civilians became the Third General
Hospital and off we went to win the war with our syringes and
bandages. First stop Mateur in Tunisia for the Sicilian invasion.
Then, as the war moved, we followed; first to Italy, near Naples,
then to Aix-en-Provence in France. Here we lived like kings in
the Hotel Du Roi Renée. The end of the war in Europe sent me

[ 637 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

on my way to Okinawa and Japan. It was a sad tumble from the
luxury of the Roi Renée, but c’est la guerre. Hiroshima found
me en route. The hospital started unpacking several times but
never did function,

In April, 1946, I was a civilian again. I took a job as assistant
to an older surgeon, started working in hospital clinics, helped
organize a medical group, and opened an office of my own.
Practice started, slowly at first, then more rapidly. A series of
appointments and promotions on the staffs of several of the hos-
pitals in the city culminated in my present position as associate
attending surgeon at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.
Two sons, David, aged ten, and Richard, aged six, and a house
in the very near suburbs, aged two, completed my postwar de-
velopment. Professional life is now quite active with too little
time for the other things I would like to do: photography, sail-
ing, listening to the Hi-Fi, fixing the house and a little gardening.

direction — although I suffered a major setback at this year’s
Harvard-Yale game!

CONVERSATION with fellow-classmates reveal that the writ-
ing of this Report has been for all of us one of the most difficult
assignments of the last twenty-five years. Most of us have not
attempted to review our lives thoroughly until now. For me, a
reference to what I wrote at the end of fifteen years and again
at the end of twenty has prompted a new approach in the light

[ 639 J

ae emtancaenane eee aH AesR ea ANE TASTES tia tania teleateesete i pmmuaedeeumasannnnbnmntnitl Ads.

of present-day thoughts. Up to now we have been able to think
and talk about what we hoped to accomplish in the future. By
now it is time to have arrived. By now it is time to take stock
of what we have done and where we are; the future can only
be a refinement of the present.

For nineteen years I have occupied myself with the hardware
business, Two years ago the founder and treasurer of our con-
cern passed away after forty-one years in the business and I suc-
ceeded him in his responsibility and in his title. Previously |
had been purchasing agent, general manager and vice-president.
The Haymarket Hardware Company has been a retail store and
an industrial, mill supply, contractors’ supply and wholesale
operation. We continue to try to be “all things to all people.”
We claim to have the most complete hardware store in our
area and life is very full trying to maintain this reputation.

Although this business life has been almost completely absorb-
ing I have still managed to include some community activity,
even though on an ever more restricted basis. Born the son of
a well-known Rabbi, Harry Levi, I have become increasingly
absorbed in the affairs of Temple Israel of Boston, the com-
munity’s principal Reform Jewish synagogue. After ten years
as a trustee I have just been elected a vice-president. During
this time I have served the organization in many ways, for the
last three years as chairman of its Building Committee. In 1954,
I was the president of its Brotherhood (or Men’s Club) and I
have just been elected a national board member of the National
Federation of Temple Brotherhoods.

Although Temple has become my major community interest,
I have managed to maintain my contact with the Boy Scouts
of America, that organization which wields such splendid in-
fluence on the young men of our nation. I have been scouting
for thirty-five years in many capacities. After graduating from
the Harvard Business School, I was a professional Scout Exec-
utive for three years before entering the hardware business.
Although time has become limited and energy has waned I have
remained sufficiently active to have aroused the interest of my
number one son, Jim. Scouting has become a wonderful ex-
perience and a great inspiration to him. Through scouting he

has also had several fine travel opportunities, both at home and

[ 640 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

abroad. A few years ago I was quite active in the fund-raising
campaigns of the Combined Jewish Appeal and the Red Feather.
Today I continue to help as much as I can (no individual of
good will ever escapes).

I can proudly report that my oldest son, Jim, was this year
accepted for admission by four top-flight universities from which
he selected Harvard, where he is now one of several Harvard
sons of the Class of 33. My number two son, Charlie, is in the
second grade. We don’t have to worry about college for him
for the present, but I think I may be forgiven for believing that
we have little need to worry about him anyway.

-My wife has continued to make me proud of her. I grow older
but she doesn’t. (Ask my little one; he thinks she is still nineteen
years old.) She is also interested in the community in her work
with several organizations and has many friends and admirers
(of both sexes).

Golf and bridge are my favorite methods of relaxing. Unfor-
turnately I relax very seldom and I am therefore inexcusably poor
at both. Reading is something I hope to do someday.

As I indicated in my first paragraph, I have not reached the
balance of life and of living for which I have been searching;
a review of what I have been doing indicates that man still can
say that he “never is, but always is to be, blessed,” while actually
he is blessed all the time and doesn’t know it.

in Dermatology and Mycology, edited by Frederick R. Schmidt, M.D.

SOME people get appendicitis from sour apples or cancer from
a stray blow here or there. I got to be a dermatologist from
our Twentieth Class Reunion. For several years previously, the
idea of taking up a specialty had been intermittently insinuating
itself into my general practitioner’s consciousness. On the basis
of experience in general practice, assisted by “intricate ratio-
cinations,” no doubt influenced by emotional overlays, and not
knowing anything about it, I chose dermatology. But the prac-
tical problems of getting three years of training at age forty-one
seemed insurmountable. I was convinced they were. So, I betook
myself off to Boston in June of 1953, with a clear mind and con-
science, looking forward with great pleasure to the three days
of fellowship which exceeded my fondest expectations, The last
day at the Dunster House luncheon, I inadvertently raised the
question of my getting specialty training. Everyone agreed with
me. It would be silly to give up a bird in the hand for two or
one or maybe a half one in the bush. It would not be impossible,
but in my situation it would be difficult to make all necessary
arrangements; and no one in his right mind should give it further
consideration. These fine and rational objections helped me de-
cide to become a dermatologist. I matriculated in Chicago at the
medical school of Northwestern University from Mondays
through Fridays from October, 1953, through September, 1956,
spending weckends at home. I was certified by the American
Board of Dermatologists, Inc., in April of 1957, and am now en-
gaged in practice in the specialty in Delavan, Wisconsin, some
§,000 strong.

The first twenty years slipped away almost as quickly as the
last five. Four years of medical school at the University of

[ 642 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

Chicago. Three years of internship and residency at the Mil-
waukee County General Hospital. Then three years of practice
as the only physician in Darien, Wisconsin, a metropolis of 500
Republicans which was made aware of my wife and me by two
Democratic votes in the 1940 presidential election. Here I learned
a few things not in the Harvard curriculum, among them not
to sell the farmer short when it comes to shrewdness. Three
years in the Medical Corps of the A.U.S., assigned to the Air
Force in New Guinea and the Philippines for two years, con-
stituted my military service. From 1946 to 1953, in Delavan,
Wisconsin, I organized, developed and then reorganized (dis-
mantled) a very active medical clinic, which was built on and
then suffered from human frailties. Did this suffering precipitate
the switch to the itch? No. It was the Twentieth Reunion.

Our family is a group of individualities who like to do some
things together and some separately. Helena and I play bridge
together. Helen and Mike play golf. Mike and I play tennis.
Jerry spends a good deal of his time in trees; and I shouldn’t
be surprised to see him bounding from one to another in Harvard
Yard at some time. We all like skating and skiing, although I re-
quire some urging. Two summers ago, Mike and I went on a fif-
teen-day canoe trip into the wilds of Canada as part of a group
of ten Boy Scouts and men. This was the kind of trip one dreams
about and hopes for at least once in a life-time. All of us join to-
gether in making a ninny out of our black dachshund, Chloe,
the successor to our super-human black dachshund, Schatzie
(1940-1951).

Like many others, I was pretty well fed up with the Armed
Forces after separation in 1946, although I did maintain Reserve
activity for several years. After a lapse of about six years,
through a strange sequence of events, I became active again in
March, 1957, and was appointed the commanding officer of the
309th Medical Battalion of the 84th Infantry Division and shortly
thereafter, was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. I
have become very enthusiastic about the organization of the
Reserve and about its importance to this country, now and in
the future. It is a bulwark that we can ill afford to neglect or
reduce for some time to come. Following a very successful sum-

mer training period with the Medical Battalion, I was made the

[ 643 ]

division surgeon for the 84th, my present Army Reserve position.

Twenty-five years later! Would I do them over again if I
had the chance? You bet I would. I wouldn’t have missed any
of the time, although, like everyone, I would probably in retro-
spect change a few episodes here and there. How about the
next twenty-five? I'd like my boys to go to Harvard because |
think the future of our country lies in the type of training which
is and will be available there. Other than that, chain reactions,
intercontinental ballistics missiles, and Sputniks to the contrary
notwithstanding, I am not too worried. I hold with Osler’s personal
ideals “to do the day’s work well and not to bother about tomor-
row ... to act the Golden rule . . . toward my professional
brethren and toward the patients committed to my care . . . and
to cultivate . . . a measure of equanimity. .” Having spent
twenty-six of my forty-six years in schools and in training for
my profession, I anticipate a fair amount of productivity from
here in. The last twenty-five years have been interesting, excit-
ing, enjoyable. I am an optimist. I look for the next twenty-five

A CLASSMATE who has gone far in the wider world, whenever
he returns to Harvard, asks me “What are you going to do when
you grow up?” That is a question I have never faced. In Paris,
the spring after graduation, I was just starting to make up my
mind when a cablegram from Cambridge invited me back to
join President Lowell’s newly established Society of Fellows.
Five years afterward I found a use for the backlog of reading
and reflection that I had meanwhile accumulated, when a pro-
fessor of English suddenly retired and I was asked to take over
some of his teaching.

Since then the annual round of courses has s set the continuous
rhythm of my existence, interspersed with occasional projects
of research and writing and with increasing bouts of administra-
tion. Even my French sabbatical, in 1952-53, included a term as
Harvard exchange professor at the Sorbonne. Never quite hav-
ing cut the umbilical cord that binds one to Alma Mater, I have
welcomed such brief opportunities to get a glimpse of other in-
stitutions. One of those was the inauguration of a new profes-

[ 645 |

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

sorship at Berkeley last year: another, I fear, will be taking me
to Europe at the very time of our Class Reunion.

Freed by Harvard from the anxieties of choosing a career or
sceking a post, I have enjoyed a maximum of freedom in pur-
suing my professional interests. These had their earliest center
in Elizabethan drama, and Shakespeare is still the subject of my
main undergraduate course. However, a developing concern
for the social and psychological aspects of literature has been
leading me toward the modern period and into the European
field. More and more of my effort has become involved with
the graduate program in Comparative Literature. But the Col-
lege has also exerted a natural claim, through its twelve-year
experiment in General Education. And now that the hope for a
Harvard Theatre seems to be on the verge of realization, it is a
privilege to take part in the planning.

Sometimes I almost feel guilty because so much of my life is
spent doing just what I have always liked to do most — reading,
writing, and talking about books and ideas with brilliant stu-
dents and congenial colleagues. Yet Cambridge, though it may
be a sort of oasis, is not a fool’s paradise. Overcrowded as it is
today, pressured on all sides by advancing conformity, it must
struggle to maintain its traditional sense of individuality. To
preserve, against statistical odds and technological distortions,
the human dimension — this is the commitment for those of us
who study and teach the humanities.

ALTHOUGH trained in industrial chemistry, 1 have spent the

last fourteen years in public health chemistry, the first three in

industrial hygiene, and the last eleven in immunology. I am in-

volved in the development and production of vaccines, toxoids,

serums and antitoxins at the State Biologic Laboratory. For the

most part, these products find their way into the arms or but-
tocks of the defenseless children of the Commonwealth. We
have evidence that this procedure redounds to the eventual bene-
fit of the life insurance companies, although no whisper of
gratitude reaches us from their direction. The increasing variety
of vaccines with which childhood has been and is in the future
destined to be beset, has driven us to recourse to cocktails
which, like the nostrums of the itinerant medicine man, will pre-
vent (not cure) a growing list of notorious plagues with a single
shock! This economy of puncture is appreciated by parents
and physicians, but not, alas, by the noisy minor who has caught

a glimpse of the syringe. The compatibility of some of these

mixtures has been occupying my attention the last couple of

years and some of the work has found its way into the appropri-

ate journals. ,

In retrospect, I would consider the fact that ours was a de-
pression class to have been the most far-reaching influence of
my life, for to it I attribute such circumstances as the suicide of
my father in 1934, seven years of unemployment (except for a
WPA interlude and several “escape” occupations outside my
field), followed by three years in the sanatorium where I left
seven good ribs as tribute. These scars, literal and figurative,
perhaps in part conditioned my iconoclastic outlook in the social-
political realm. Came the war, and at last I could be used, at
any rate in civilian life. Thus the first job in my field came in
1943, a military substitute in State Civil Service. Sometimes I
wonder why I have clung to this rut fourteen years. For one
thing, the above grim picture made me quite security-conscious.
One observes a good deal of that among our contemporaries.

[ 647 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

And each postwar year I (and many others) expected a resump-
tion of the depression of the thirties. Civil service and teaching
posts were highly valued during the depression but, alas, quite
the contrary in these happier days! I have had all of two promo-
tions in these fourteen years, and such occasional general salary
increases as the Great and General Court could be persuaded
would restore a portion of inflation’s loot.

Married in ’46, babies in °47 and ’51. Purchased a small home
in *51 and discovered that some home-improving chores were an
enjoyable diversion. My pride and joy is a new, large living-
room and fireplace which I planned and built myself. All visi-
tors are required to look at the progress snapshots.

Satisfactory vacations had always been a budget problem un-
til we discovered camping. Last summer we purchased a small
camping trailer which sleeps the four of us and traveled all
over New Hampshire the first trip and Cape Cod the second,
using the State Park camp grounds, blithely cheating the vora-
cious motels and restaurants. The mobility, friendly sociability,
and all around delightfulness of this kind of vacation impressed
us greatly. We all look forward to next summer’s excursions,

How do I look at the more or less immediate future of our
generation? The great issue, as many times before, but never
with nearly the cogency, is war or peace. I prophesy peace with
absolute confidence, for should I prove wrong, few will be around
to call me on it. What, then, will be the nature of the peace?
Some people, when they hear the word “co-existence,” reach
for their guided missile. Perhaps the word does not explain
enough. It seems to me that if war is to be averted between to-
day’s Giant Dichotomy, the two Systems must evolve in the
direction of common ground by abandoning the worst and
adopting the best in each. To be more specific, I would say that
the Soviet World needs, more than anything else, to listen to
Thomas Jefferson and his amazing faith in majority rule in a
day when mass education was but a dream. The Western World
needs not only to acknowledge, but to act upon the fact that
laissez-faire is dead beyond resuscitation. There have been hope-
ful indications in the past decade that both Systems have been
moving along these converging paths,

AS I look back over the years since 1933, it is hard to believe
that twenty-five years have passed. Although much has hap-
pened in the world, what with depression, inflation, war and
Sputniks, little has transpired in my personal life. It is true, I
added a few gray hairs, a few pounds and a duodenal ulcer.

My father’s ill health resulted in my entering the family busi-
ness. I managed the Northampton Hardware Company, a labor
of necessity rather than love. Upon my father’s death in 1944,
I became owner of the business. Retail hardware occupied all
of my time and energy.

During a vacation in Newark, New Jersey, I met a blonde (and
who hasn’t) who became my wife. The result of the marriage
was two children, Harriet was brought into the world by Dr.
Benjamin Bacon of the Class of 1933; Fred entered this world
with an assist from Dr. L. Gillespie of the Class of 1933. My busi-
ness finances are in the hands of Samuel Wolcott of the Class of
1933. So you see, I am indebted to our Class for much of my
happiness.

My idle time (?) is spent in helping my son with his military
models and my daughter with her scientific projects. I also en-
joy gardening and making minor repairs and improvements on
our home.

HAVING swept through my four years at Cambridge in the
field of French literature, and after minor difficulties with various
probations and with (of all things) Bible, Shakespeare, Homer,
and Sophocles, I plunged headlong into the bookkeeping divi-
sion of the foreign department of the Manufacturers Trust Com-
pany, 55 Broad Street, New York. After this thrilling experi-
ence, I sped through various other phases of money-lending in
this institution, mostly credit and real estate. Just before rigor
mortis set in (it took seven years), in 1940 we moved to Wil-
liamsburg, Virginia, where for four months I was engaged in
the vital war industry of selling reproductions of eighteenth
century furniture and furnishings at the Craft House of Colonial
Williamsburg, Inc. .

February, 1941, found me called to active duty as ensign in
the U.S.N.R. After three months in Boston at the local defense
school, I was ordered to Norfolk, Virginia, for duty with Com-
mander Inshore Patrol of Fifth Naval District. My first com-
mand was duty as skipper of a decked-over fifty-foot motor
launch which made several hazardous trips up Chesapeake Bay.
Just before this craft fell to picces I was made C.O. of USS
PCs10, a converted yacht, which was also deemed sufficiently
unscaworthy to prevent its being ordered outside of the same
body of water, thank fortune! By this time I knew these waters

[ 650 }

so well that I commanded a small tug operating out of Cape
Charles. December 7, 1941, found me completely confused in
a course at the Gyro Compass School at Brooklyn Navy Yard.
I returned to Norfolk and was ordered to Fort Story, Virginia,
as officer in charge of a Navy detachment to be trained to
operate harbor entrance control posts. This lasted for two years,
and life at Virginia Beach was most pleasant.

The prospect of spending the entire war on shore in Virginia,
however, became too awful to contemplate, and I was therefore
sent to Miami to the Sub-Chaser Training School where my
work was so brilliant that I was ordered to Solomons, Maryland,
to command a flotilla (36) of Landing Craft Tanks. By this time
our hero was lieutenant commander, his rapid rise from ensign
deriving solely from the fact that his date of rank was June 21,
1933. From Solomons I was awarded duty as commander LCT
Flotilla 16 which sent me to New Orleans, San Francisco, Pear]
Harbor, Saipan, Guam, Leyte, Okinawa, and finally Tokyo. In
November, 1945, I returned to Pearl Harbor enroute to the
States, where I was awarded the Bronze Star for the Okinawa
and Tokyo business. An Alnav promoted me to commander
during my terminal leave.

The readjustment period, so-called, decided me to abandon
further activity in Williamsburg, and we moved to my family’s
farm in Falls Village, Connecticut, where I became happily in-
volved in animal husbandry, dairy farming to you. A herd of
registered Brown Swiss cattle were all-absorbing, though not
very lucrative. Our children attended the excellent Salisbury
public schools, and learned to take care of themselves, their
parents, and a horde of dogs, pigs, chickens, cows, tractors, and
gardens. I was revoltingly healthy, rotten financially, but get-
ting ahead spiritually, and in March, 1951, I had made up my
mind to enter the ministry. This, I am sure, would never have
happened without my farming experience, since I found that
the purely mechanical business of driving tractors up and down
rows of crops afforded time for the mind to occupy itself with
something other than the job immediately at hand. This you
cannot do while manning a typewriter or other office machinery.

I entered the Berkeley Divinity School at New Haven, Connect-

icut, immediately after Easter, 1951, as the oldest living under-
graduate, and in 1953 I passed the canonical examinations for
the diaconate and priesthood. It proved very difficult to return
to the academic world after my fleeting experience in Cambridge
almost twenty years earlier, but by 1957 I managed to earn the
degree of Bachelor of Sacred Theology. My first and only parish
to date has been Saint John’s Church, Warehouse Point, Connect-
icut.

Our family is deeply engrossed in schools, with my wife, Mab-
sie, secretary of the Ethel Walker School Alumnae Association;
my daughter, Muff, a senior there; Chip, a fourth former at St.
Mark’ s, Southboro, following in his father’s and grandfather’s
footsteps; and Georgie, my younger daughter, attending the
Junior School in West Hartford. In summer we all manage to
collect at Nantucket.

MY life since graduation has been to work at any job which
interests me and affords me a decent salary. 1 omit details. Same
would hardly interest the Class. Ditto my convictions and view-
points. I have deliberately avoided responsibilities and entangle-
ments. I am foot-loose and fancy free and not what may be
described as a community pillar.

My job, which is still that of purser, enables me to combine my
hobbies of fishing and sight-seeing. Since writing last, I have
been to London, England and Southampton; Amuay Bay, Vene-
zucla,; on a trip around the world via the Panama and Suez
Canals; bathing in Gatun Lake; visited the ports of Yokohama

and Kure, Japan; Kaohsiung, Formosa; Singapore; Ras-at-
Tenura, Saudi Arabia; Mena-al-Ahmadi, Kuwait; Port Said.
Coastwise, I have traveled from San Pedro, California, to Mont-
real and entered all of the in-between ports. These peregrinations
were made on the S.S. Amoco Delaware.

Late in 1956, American Oil Company dropped the purser
rating; I rejected a chance to work shoreside in the New York
office and terminated November 2d. Four days later 1 was em-
ployed, sight unseen, by Mathiasen’s and flew from Boston to
Tampa where I boarded the Buenaventura. Since then I have
been making the rounds in Florida, Texas and the West Indies
and Mediterranean areas, calling at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
Cristobal, C.Z., San Nicolaas, Aruba, Barcelona, Spain and Poz-
zuoli on the Bay of Naples, Italy. One Saturday at Pozzuoli,
the radio officer and myself hired a Fiat and two chauffeurs and
drove to Rome, over the Appian Way, toured the city on Sun-
day, saw the statuary and architecture I’d studied in Fine Arts
courses at Fogg and returned to Naples late Sunday afternoon.
Pozzuoli is a paradise for “rubberneckers” — just a few miles from
the island of Ischia, with Capri around the next cove and Pom-
peii just over the hills. That trip from the Netherlands Antilles
to Gibraltar through Guadeloupe Channel is a very pleasant
one at any time of the year.

Recently, I have been to Reykjavik and Hvalfordjur, Iceland,
where I was kept awake by twenty-four hours of daylight and
got in some flounder and salmon fishing, and to Argentia, New-
foundland. As I write now (September, 1957), I have come up
to Hampton Roads from Key West and Houston. We now
await either a trip to Thule, Greenland, inside the Arctic Circle

or annual inspection at Newport News.

I travel about 100,000 miles per annum by sea; the life aboard
ship is both interesting and confining , depending on the run and
the climate. Next time when I’m in New York, “Mickey” alias
Mrs, and my old pal, Dr. Elliott Hurwitt, °33, have promised
that if I can find my way to Scarsdale they will put me up for

the night on a raft in the swimming pool, just to make me feel

myself, I have undergone quite an adventure. Without advance

warning I became suddenly very sick, and on October 15, 1957,

I had emergency abdominal surgery. I am convalescing nicely
snd values are resuming normal relationships rapidly.

From the time of graduation my business life has been spent
in Corinth, connected with The Security Bank. I became presi-

of the Wurlitzer Company, for over a century manufacturers
of musical instruments. The Wurlitzer Company has a growing
plant in Corinth.

As our area and state are growing industrially I have been in-

an important role in the transition from a predominantly agri-
cultural state to one better balanced with industry.

bridge and reading good books. Margaret, my wife, and I enjoy

to the fullest playing bridge with our friends and I enjoy im-

MY recollective apparatus is faulty —something I discovered
trying to span a quarter of a century with memory. Looking
backward with the help of letters, and bills, and automobile
logs, I relived many moments I couldn’t possibly chronicle here.
But two things stand out; I’m still with the same family I started
about twenty-five years ago and still with the same firm I
joined right after graduation. I am happy with both and I think
both are happy with me.

A district sales office of the International Harvester Company
in Sale Lake City hired me in 1933 and I started in the credits
and collections office. Bills receivable were pretty high in those
days you may remember. Later I was shifted over to the ac-
counting end of the district office business. I was learning what
commencement really meant,

Meanwhile, a high school romance with the only girl I ever
dated blossomed into marriage in 1934. Our daughter and first
child was born in Sale Lake. This trio was transferred to Har-
vester’s general offices in Chicago in 1940. I took up residence
in the advertising department as a research economist. My family
settled in nearby Evanston and here our second child and only
son was born.

Harvester had been in the defense business long before it was
in the war business. After hostilities starred almost all hands

three-man public relations group. This group has since grown

My formal public relations portfolios are relations with trade

back to the Yard three times in the last ten years. The third is

In addition, as the job spec says, I “perform related duties as
assigned.” ‘This is an amazing and interesting variety of things,

THE past quarter-century has given our Class a variety of dis-
orderly economic and political backgrounds for our presuma-
bly well-regulated private lives. To account briefly for my time,
I went to work after college in a typical New Engl, and textile

mill for four years. This gave me a close view of the north end
of an industry running south. For any future historian of the
Depression, I think that the low point then came in 1937 when I
had to take a civil service examination with some 63,000 fellow-
citizens to get a job. After a few months in civil service, I en-
joved some ten years with Price, Waterhouse in public account-
ing in Boston. Then down to Connecticut and Bridgeport Brass
in 1946.

I find accounting a very interesting combination of figures
and people, theory and practice. It has supported and still sup-
ports a family, and I hope will continue to do so through several
imminent college educations. This leads me to reflect that a family
picture substituted above might summarize the past twenty-five
years for most of us as well as a proverbial thousand words.

branches in New York City, Detroit and Florida.

This career was interrupted for five years by military service
in Africa, Italy and France, with rank from private to major.

We now live in a rather picturesque old farm in northern West-
chester, where my time is devoted to some dilettante golf, con-
siderable small boating and some gardening, mostly under duress.

AFTER college I went to work as a reporter on a morning
paper in my home city. My father soon concluded he would
never be able to retire on my earnings from a journalistic career
and persuaded me to go to law school. I regret that he was not
able to retire on my earnings as a lawyer either, but his persua-
sion did result in my meeting my wife (a lovely girl but with no
taste in men) and my admission to the Bar.

It was also pleasant to return to Cambridge; and the rigors of
Harvard Law School were no obstacle to the romantic foray
which has had such a happy issue (see vital statistics).

After touring law offices in New York City during Christmas
vacation my last year in law school, I secured employment with

[ 659 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

the Brooklyn law firm of Cullen & Dykman, which had been in
existence since before the Civil War and which still survives not-
withstanding my continuous association with it since September,
1936. The tempo of practice in Brooklyn has been to my taste
and, although our firm has a branch office in the Wall Street Dis-
trict of New York City, it has avoided the unhappy pressures
which so often attend a New York City practice.

For eight years I have been a commuter on the Long Island
Railroad which, contrary to popular reputation, is quite a good
railroad. I am able to play cards for about two hours each day
on the train, a pastime which might otherwise lead to serious
domestic complications.

Gardening takes up most of the leisure left me by my family.
Teen-agers, before they get senior licenses, require their parents
to spend considerable time on the road and the mother of our
teen-agers invited me to attend her seminar on teen-age problems
(meets seven days a week or at the pleasure of the instructor).
This is not an elective course, but thus far I have been happy
to take it and we are pleased at the results.

I have a Sunday School class of sixth graders and devote some
hours of work each week during the school year preparing to
tcach them what they should learn for their souls’ health. This
has been an experience which, I fear, has been far more reward-
ing for me than for them.

As for social-political and religious convictions, which it is
suggested “the Class wants to know all about,” as the days pass
I think I have less of the former and, perhaps, more of the latter.
Before attempting to communicate such convictions, however,
I would require more than the general assurance that “the Class
wants to know all about” them.

MEMBER OF: Oneida (New York) County Medical Society; Yahnundasis

AFTER my internship at Rochester, New York, General Hos-
pital, we moved to New Hartford, New York, scene of my
boyhood days, to enter private practice in the field of general
medicine. In July, 1942, I entered the Army as a first lieutenant
at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, with the Eighth Infantry Divi-
sion; thence to Camp Forrest and the 68th Medical Regiment.
I was given a medical discharge in November, 1943, and re-
turned to New Hartford, where I have practised since.

Because the practice was restricted considerably for reasons
of health, I found time at last to watch my boys grow up and to
grow with them, and at the same time take up boating, fishing,
golfing and further study of the organ, as well as singing lessons.
Many pleasant days were spent on the beautiful St. Lawrence
River cruising with the family aboard a forty-foot Chris-Craft
cruiser. I have had two trips to Florida and one to the Midwest,
but the most fascinating travel has been on the boat — across
Lake Ontario and Lake Erie beyond Detroit, into Canada, and
into Long Island Sound to Montauk, via the historic and beau-
tiful Mohawk Valley and the Hudson River.

Politically I am a Republican; religiously, a member of West-
minster Church, Presbyterian, of Utica, New York, where I am
an elder, a member of the choir and assistant organist.

As for the family, there could be none finer. Two fine,
healthy, Christian boys, one ready for college. As for Eleanor,
no one could fill better the role of a physician’s wife; since she
has an excess of the two necessary virtues, patience and under-
standing. She, too, is fond of golfing and boating, but her first
love is flowers and the creating of floral arrangements, at which
she is an expert. And above all, I know that she must have some
quality about which I know nothing, to be able to live quite

happily with a Harvard man for twenty years. For it seems
that I have always heard that you can tell a Harvard man, but
you can't tcll him anything.

At any rate, life has been wonderful and our blessings many
since 1933. The only regret that I have is that reunions with the
close friends I made in college have to be so very infrequent, for
the years seem to be passing quickly.

IN college I lasted through five days of the Crimson's sopho-

paperman, I don’t know what this proves about heredity, en-
vironment or both, but I'm sure it pounds home a point about

[ 662 J

2§TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

nepotism. My father, a newspaper editor, persuaded his pub-
lisher to take a chance on me.

My first job, happily, was in Miami, southern extremity of
the James M. Cox newspaper axis. (My father worked for the
headquarters paper in Dayton.) Miami, even in Depression Days,
was a glamorous locale for the debut of a police reporter. After
two years, however, I was jerked off the “street” and herded
into the Ivory Tower. For the last twenty-two years I have
been writing editorials. It’s obvious how effective I have been
at this trade; just take note of how much world conditions have
changed for the better!

After five years of saving souls in Sodom I ran into heavy
policy weather and scuttled into a temporary haven on the edi-
torial page of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. This was more than
a refuge. It was an experience — something like playing half a
season with the New York Yankees. But events soon dissolved
the policy clouds in Miami and we picked up our St. Louis-born
firstborn and tiptoed back to the subtropics, intellectual integrity
‘intact and editorial horizons considerably broadened. During
the next five years I translated some spare time into sporadic
extracurricular writing. The results were modest. In 1943 I
reached the peak of fulfillment when the now defunct Free
World dropped an obscure name into a front-cover assemblage
of Sigrid Undset, Hans Habe, the police commissioner of New
York City and the vice-president of Uruguay. This was better
for the ego than for the esophagus: the check was $30!

Three years thereafter, more “prestige” that I couldn’t eat
came in the form of the 1946 Sigma Delta Chi award for editorial
writing. This was followed by a more nourishing bit of good
news — award of a Nieman fellowship for the academic year
1946-47. I wish space permitted me to say more about the value
of a Nieman year to a working newspaperman and of the par-
ticular impressions that go with a second round at Harvard
after thirteen years of exile. Suffice it to say the experience was
an intellectual challenge and a sentimental bonanza.

Obviously, there were differences between 1933 and 1947.
Radcliffe had made good the great invasion—or was it in-
filtration? Veterans were out in force and with high-powered
academic orientation. I wasn’t a veteran, but my orientation had

[ 663 ]

by history and by preponderance of present leadership, the
Democratic party comes closer to expressing my philosophy
than does the strain which I still suspect is regnant in the G.O.P. |
I watch with interest the trend to “modern Republicanism.”
My approval is tempered by periods of discouragement and oc-
casional moments of skepticism.

When I fall to wondering whether history will stay the course
with me, I often am confirmed in my faith by reference to that
most sadly undersung stanza of Fair Harvard:

Let not moss-covered error moor thee by its side
As the world on truth’s current glides by.
Be the herald of light and the bearer of love
_ Till the stock of the Puritans die.

3ut Harvard stands for so much more than any man’s inter-
pretation of the events of a fearfully complex age that I make
no attempt to chain its anthem to service of any party, platform
or political personality. Harvard stands for a philosophy that
reveres truth and revolves around the sun of freedom. Harvard
is prodder of the questing mind and protector of the articulat-
ing spirit.

That's one reason I keep at the schools work even when I
find myself in simultaneous (if not serious) trouble with my
wife, my boss and my doctor. In fact, excuse me now — I’ve got
to check on the grades of that all-city halfback that Ohio State,
Michigan, Tennessee and Notre Dame are after.

A MIMEOGRAPHED letter from a class agent seeking funds,
not for Harvard ’33 —at least not this one — came in the mail
the other day. Hand-written at the bottom was a personal
greeting from someone last encountered more than 30 years ago;
“Dear George, Are you still one of those ivory tower guys?”
Since the answer to the question is still, “Yes, I am,” it called to
mind Erwin Panofsky’s remarks at Commencement in the Yard
last year, when he received an honorary degree.

He began by pointing out that “to say of a man that he lives
in an ivory tower has come to be one of the most insulting re-
marks that can be passed without leading to an action for slander
or libel.” In defense Panofsky pointed out with a wit and
modesty to which I cannot do justice in a few sentences the ad-
vantages of a site on a tower. “Height, needless to sav, widens
the horizon of the observer and enables him to see things in a
perspective rather different from that in which they present
themselves when swirling around him on ground level . . . The
man on the ground has the power to act; but he has not always
the power to see . . . the man on the tower has (only) the power
to see... To do at least that much, it is for him to stick to the
tower.” And stick I have, to the point where I am perhaps as
much “stuck” as “seeing”!

At least I can say that I have found the problems of and re-
sponsibilities for maintaining a perspective especially difficult —
and when met, rewarding — in a professional school, where the
challenge comes from relating knowledge to the affairs of practi-

[ 667 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

cal life and vice versa, More or less by accident at the beginning,
my interests have fallen in the rapidly developing area of the
social sciences and business administration. So my “ivory tower”
life has been one of work and excitement; of work in keeping
up with the demands of teaching in a rapidly growing field and
of adventure and excitement in a group actively seeking new
ideas through research. The book I mentioned five years ago
was at long last finished, on the whole a critical and not — very
definitely not! —a popular success.

As for family, I unhesitatingly recommend seven as the num-
ber likely to give the most fun. If I want someone to drive the
car, saw wood, play tennis, cook, or knit a pair of mittens, there
are the older ones. Then there are the middle ones for going to
the beach, mowing the lawn, growing tomatoes, picking blue-
berries, and looking after chickens. Or if I want to stay home,
there is the baby who needs a sitter. And with seven these
pleasures do not come separately and well spaced over the years
but all at once every day. (Annabel, to sit with, really is the
life-saver.)

We spend as much time as we can outdoors in the woods
around the house in Weston and in summer swimming and sail-
ing at the Cape. In Weston, I have taken part in efforts in the
town to set aside land for forest and trails. Even though both
Route 128 and the new Toll Road go through Weston, we can
get from the Boston side of town well out into Wayland on
trails without crossing more than a few traveled roads. At the
Cape I will match our flotilla of boats—bought, built, and
blown ashore in the hurricanes — under 18’ in length for variety
with anyone else’s collection. The most exciting is a sailfish
Josh made two winters ago and that he and his sisters have been
sailing and racing with great enjoyment ever since. (I take pic-
tures of them in good days!)

FROM pedaling a bicycle 1500 miles around Europe after leav-
ing college I shifted to tanning leather, moving in 1938 from
Massachusetts to the long winters and seven-day summers of
Maine. The first night we spent there was twenty-eight degrees
below! The years from 1938 to 1948 were spent in the tannery
making essential leather during the war years.

The relief from drudgery that made these years happy was the
planning and building of first a small cutter and then a forty-
five-foot auxiliary ketch, Argo Navis, which was commissioned
in 1948 and took part in the Bermuda Race of that year. That
fall the tropics beckoned and having acquired a crew of two
able-bodied seawomen, ages nine and ten, I took the family on
the forty-five-foot ketch and spent a year cruising the Bahamas,
Cuba, Costa Rica, San Blas Islands, Panama, Galapagos Islands,
and the west coast of South America, trying to thaw out from
the cold of eleven Maine winters. The girls became quite adept

[ 669 ]

at sailing during this time. The next winter we spent in the
Hawaiian Islands getting some more sailing in and when we re-
turned to Maine we decided that coastal living was for us, so we
moved to Marblehead Neck and I started “peddling papers”
being associated with John Carter & Company in Boston. (Be-
fore leaving Maine I served in the Maine Legislature in 1950,
1951— was appointed to the Committee on Business Legisla-
tion.)

The girls have enjoyed growing up on the ‘coast and we have
maintained our interest in cruising and the salt water. We are
looking forward to seeing old friends again and spending some
more time in the tropics as time permits. We are members of
the First Church of Christ (Congregational) in Marblehead;
still voting Republican but don’t know why. Hope to see you all

NEVER having been one to plan long-term goals in personal
living, it is interesting to look back and see that in fact a few
goals have been reached which in hindsight appear worth the
effort. Had it been done in advance, I am sure it would have led
to great self-consciousness and probably some unhappiness. The
net result has somehow been, I think, my employment in a way
which is reasonably effective use of the abilities at hand,

Chronologically, the career breaks down into three fairly
distinct periods. The first, an academic period when basic re-
search in chemistry and teaching were the fields that interested
me most. In fact, they continue to, but life in the academic
grove is not what it was before the War and financial realities
are very real. This period lasted from 1933 to 1942 and in-
cluded a fellowship at Yale—where I had a marvelous time
following my Ph.D. work at Harvard, and a very happy four
years at Trinity College in Hartford. There in Connecticut I
had the excellent sensitivity to recognize love at first sight! The
results — an ideal marriage.

The War terminated the academic phase and opened up an
even more interesting one, namely employment with the Federal
Government for four years in the capacity of technical aide in
the Office of Scientific Research & Development. Most of this
time was spent in contributing, I hope successfully, to the battle
of the Potomac, but I did emerge with some tangible and per-
sonal rewards. These included a short snorter bill, a Certificate
of Merit from Harry Truman, and an appreciation that science
is broader than chemistry and that, industrial work can be even
more interesting than academic. However, a complete transi-
tion was a little hard to accept abruptly and we returned to the
campus for one more year at Williams College before full
entrance into phase three, which is technical industrial consult-

ing.

In the last ten years this pursuit has consumed my interests

[ 671 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

and has furthered my education enormously, The field of con-
tract research and development is primarily a field of problem
solving under schedules of time and money, and in fields of
science that are not always recognized in the textbooks. Par-
ticularly has this sort of work led into boundary science and into
the humanities. The administration of people and the manage-
ment of programs have become increasingly important with
non-uniformity in both a constant challenge. The life is also far
from being a static one, since the problems exist on a world-
wide basis and it is always best to meet with the client on his
home ground, whether this be in Europe, Hawaii, Canada or
Mexico. The advantages for combining pleasure with business
on some of these expeditions have been realized.

Throughout most of this third period and superimposed on
the mundane aspects of a vocation, are the very real advantages
of a family of three active children, their childhood diseases
(which I have shared all too completely with them), their home-
work (which I have not shared much), and their pets (where
the sharing is more even). The effort is well repaid, although
Internal Revenue does not calculate it in that way. Wife and
family have kept me reasonably young, interested in politics,
sports and the arts— both applied and fine — and allowed time
for gardening, mountaineering and the usual pleasures of society.

The Harvard education I received has been a real base for
successful living. This is in spite of the danger which the ability
to think exposes!

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

oFFIcEs HELD: Member Sub-Committee for Public Relations, Trustees Ex-
amining Committee, Boston Public Library System, 1954-55.

IN 1938, after five years of typical grappling with the problems
of depression, I joined the Rexall organization and have remained
with that company in various posts to the present. In 1943 I
married Eunice Rose Connerton, the sister of a classmate. We
have had no children. This fact, coupled with the gradual ac-
quisition of twenty nieces and nephews, marks me as the only
non-breeder of a fairly prolific clan.

My avocations have been and are more individual than com-
munal. Over the years I’ve reread most of my once tedious
college and high school classics, to my surprise, with increasing
interest and profit. Even the Gallic Wars, the traditional bore
of second year Latin, seemed, I recall, a fascinating sidelight to
a developed interest in the literature of Celtic origins. I’ve made
a lightly informal study of painting and tried my hand at it.
Two of my productions, allegedly impressions of the Maine
coast, hang, with temerity, in my living room and, safe to say,
will hang in no one else’s,

Of late years my wife and I have made annual excursions to
Maine, of which state we, like others entering its spell, have
become somewhat devotees. Last summer we visited St. An-
drews, New Brunswick, where I viewed with respectful regard
the grave marker of the first Loughran to inhabit these parts,
one John, born County Tyrone, 1801, arrived St. Andrews via
sailing sloop 1815 and died there 1878.

As for religious and social convictions, one thought. With
the arrival of Sputnik and ICBM, I have a notion that the stuffy
old platitudes of social and religious leaders, so blithely dis-
counted this last decade — “the strength and moral fibre of the
nation lie in the integrity of the home”; “the better life consists
not merely in the possession of things but in the development of
mind and spirit” — have suddenly come into their own. Better
family discipline might have given us more responsible kids,
less delinquency, more and better students, more and better men
of science and general scholarship, more and better guided mis-
siles. Are push-button control, finger-tip steering and all the
rest really so impressive against the stupendous fait accomrpli of

a man-placed satellite whirling in orbit at 18,000 miles per hour in
an exact balance of gravity and centrifugal force? The old worn
platitudes, it seems to me, have come to life suddenly as the
bitter verities, wistfully and fatefully neglected.

HERE, bending over an old portable trying to cover the past

quarter-century, I’m sweating out another baby. They seem to

arrive every ten years. May 1967 be as fruitful! And on the

subject of kids, the older one right now is at Katy Gibbs in

Boston, occasionally being squired by some Harvard guy from

across the river at the Business School.

With a few interruptions I have spent most of the past twenty-
five years here in Honolulu, the hub of “the loveliest chain of
islands.” They have been wonderful years but very few hours
have been spent soaking up the sun at Waikiki. Yes, we work
pretty hard in this fast developing Hawail. My years have been
divided between the car business, the Navy and the baking busi-
ness.

Pearl Harbor is our back yard. December 7 dawned with a
hangover and a hairy show. Four months later I was signed up
with the Navy supposedly to run a coast watcher sampan, but
thanks probably to my two years at Harvard, I was commissioned
a j.g. and given the job of guarding the day’s receipts of the ships
service store. This was a lucky break for me as it led to some
fine tours of the Pacific in two ships, the first an oil man’s palatial
yacht and the second an APA whose greatest claim to fame was
to be the first ship to be demolished by an atomic blast. I was
skipper of both ships and the four years were really good duty.

Today the few spare hours a week that are left over for play
are devoted to a lifelong hobby of boating and deep sea fishing,
particularly with my new bride from up state New York.
Nancy just hung her first marlin. Sandwiched in to maintain the
balance of the old with the new are a couple of interesting
courses, one in guided missiles to keep up with the Navy, and the
other with Japanese addicts of aikido, a combination of physical
culture, self-hypnotism and mayhem, which comes from Japan
by way of India. Yes, life is very full and fascinating and we love
it here in Hawaii.

I HAVE been engaged in the practice of law in St. Louis con-
tinuously since 1936, except for two periods of government serv-
ice.

The first period, 1942 through 1945, was spent in the Army.
It taught me to regard memory as a library, to leave many books
on the shelves, and select for reading those which offer pleasure.

The second period, 1949-50, was spent with the Excess Profits
Tax Council of the Bureau of Internal Revenue “determining”
what corporations’ normal profits would have been under
hypothetical normal circumstances. It taught me that those
things which in any event will not be done well, ought at least
be done quickly.

My practice has involved for the most part federal taxation.
Since Congress repealed Dean Griswold’s first course in that sub-
ject in 1936, Congress, the Courts, Treasury Department, Dean
Griswold and I have been trying desperately to keep up with
each other; and in the breathless race we have all (even I) left

far behind us the guides of income taxation. The systematic Adam
Smith left his bones in the vaults of Veazie Bank and his faint
shadow remaining cannot audibly protest the breathless ex-
pressions of income: “You got it, ain’t you?” and “Income comes
in,” not as Dick Whittington’s cat, which gained capitally, but as
the camel which “came in” the Arab’s tent.

Put me down as whirling in my own small orbit watching the
antics of “intocome” taxation.

e .
THE years 1933-58 have not been an easy period, but personally,
I feel that the positive values and satisfactions have more than
outweighed the difficulties. Most classes have not been favored
with such a combination of depression, war, boom and Sputnik!
In Purchasing, we have a descriptive expression that fairly well
describes it, “Never a dull day, but lots of headaches!”

From a work standpoint, my twenty-five-year span has in-
cluded five years of university research and teaching in agri-
cultural economics and rural organization; nine years with the
Federal Government, in statistical and administrative posts; and,
more recently, eleven years in the farm implement and electrical
equipment industries, principally in business research and purchas-
ing.

This tour of jobs has included several major places of residence,
all of which our family has enjoyed for their particular brands of
charm; Upstate New York for its folksiness and scenery, Virginia
for its easy-going climate and warm-hearted people; Washington,
D.C.—so close to the fountainhead of decision in time of
emergency; Downstate Illinois for its good black earth, energy
and midwestern viewpoints; and, finally, Westchester County for
its cultural and business opportunities, and high cost of living.

The high points in my government career were probably, first,
involvement in administrative and organization planning during
the early days of the War Production Board; and, second, re-
sponsibility for securing histories of industrial mobilization ac-
tivities from the various industry divisions of W.P.B. Before
leaving the Government, I had some share in the historical pro-
gram of the War Production Board, but concluded that in any
future emergency the principal leadership and innovations would
come from outside the Career Service.

About the time of our Twentieth Reunion, I left the farm
equipment industry, where I had been assistant to the vice-presi-
dent for purchasing, and became manager, purchasing research,
for General Electric Company at Schenectady, Three years ago,
the function was transferred to New York City where I am now

[ 681 ]

an adjusted but unenthusiastic commuter. My present work is
in purchasing market research, a “younger brother” to market
research as practiced in most sales organizations. It is a develop-
ing, little understood and therefore fascinating area of activity,
Further details gladly furnished on request.

From the standpoint of Family, my blessings include a good,
but not docile, wife and three healthy children of assorted sexes.
Our life is often pleasant, seldom dull. Ellen, the oldest, is a
struggling but happy sophomore at the University of Pennsyl-
vania. At different times and in varying combinations, personal
and family hobbies have been tennis, hiking, gardening and
sailing. My present pride and joy is a 24-foot one design sloop
called the Flying Saucer, which was the first in the popular Raven
class designed by my Naval architect brother, Roger. Household
repairs and gardening currently have a lower priority. My wife
is now No. 1 gardener and No. 1 crew.

We are often told that a good citizen is one who takes an active
part in community and public affairs. In this respect, I have en-
deavored to play a strong supporting réle in interesting and
worthwhile projects that come my way. Periodically, when I
have found myself away from home four or more nights a week
for some period, my wife has usually arranged to become “active”
on my nights at home. This has been effective in causing a speedy
reduction in any overzealousness. The cycle repeats itself at ap-
proximately seven-year intervals,

There have been times when I have wished that my education
(and talents) had included more emphasis on science, engineering,
and finance (especially finances). All in all, however, I think
that a liberal education has helped me to adapt to changing times;
to preserve a fairly objective “long view” on current problems;
and to put a high value on good reading, contemplation and
friendly association.

After twenty-five years, it should be possible to produce some
philosophical gems that would summarize my views on life in
general. This classmate prefers to postpone any such statement
until our Fiftieth. —

TWENTY-FIVE years ago I set out from the Harvard Yard
in pursuit of happiness. I followed a well-trodden path up the
steep incline to the Doctorate in Medicine. After this the or-
thodox appeal of special training in surgery consumed the dying
years of the thirties. The next turn in the road led me to the
altar, where I acquired my first asset, a truly wonderful wife.
And now we continue the great adventure together, sustained
— at times almost visibly propelled — by the alternating motive
power of five healthy children. In the meanwhile we had hap-
pily embarked on a challenging and absorbing career in gynecol-
ogy in Providence, Rhode Island.

In college I had been introduced to the Humanities and had
tasted a bit of the world’s literatures. A quarter of a century
of medicine has brought among other things an appreciation of
precise mensuration and the scientific method, as well as that yen
for probing and divining, that is analytical. Paradoxically
enough, we still possess a love for the abstract, for the philosoph-
ical and the poetic, for the universals. However, the scientist
of the day rejects the absolutes and embraces technology. As a

[ 683 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

result we have the problems of radio-active fall-out, air-pollution,
high-speed transportation — an environment unsuited to man—
and, incidentally, more work for the doctor.

We still find time to read the masters, none the less. I am in-
clined to agree with Santayana that our modern technical society
will find its place as part of a better ordered whole (civilization),
where Freedom and the Soul reign, ultimately. I have enjoyed
Arnold Toynbee’s A Study of History for penetration, style and
method; but I cannot agree with his inferences and prognosis
for the future of western man. He tends to underestimate — or
at least to understate — the resilience of the now dormant western
spirit.

Medicine is an arduous profession; but it is also rewarding, for
it brings one close to the inner springs of man’s being. Even
the dullest physician cannot but ask, why? As a basis for the
study of philosophy and theology and psychology there is none
better. The scientist of the future must be a metaphysician as
well as a creative technologist; lest man destroy himself in a
series of wild, ungoverned explosions. It sounds grim, but these
are crucial times, for the amoral and irresponsible scientist, vig-
orous proponent of unlimited academic freedom is like a juvenile
delinquent sitting behind a machine gun with an atomic grenade
in either hand. Sine auctoritate nulla vita.

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

RECOLLECTING now the shattering spectacle, back there in

the spring of the year 1933, of the Class of 1908 tottering about

the Yard, I am rather more surprised that I am able today to sit

up and take notice at all than I am to find myself the lone vice-

president of one of the country’s more distinguished and pros-
perous book publishing houses, the husband of a remarkably at-
tractive wife, the father of two remarkably attractive daughters
of the interesting ages of sixteen and twelve, a suburbanite (and
therefore a commuter), and a guy who, despite logic and reason,
can’t convince himself that old age really is just around the
corner. In short, homo Amrericanus typicus —the sociologist’s
delight.

Stull, it isn’t a bad enclave amidst the encroaching shambles, I
am not at all confident I could figure out a better, had I to do it
all over again. Even Harvard, which as an undergraduate I’m
afraid I found not wholly inspiring, seems now to have been and
to be a quite extraordinary institution.

As for the rest, to put it as succinctly as possible, I taught school
for a few years after leaving Cambridge, at the same time taking
an M.A. at Columbia; then in 1937 I joined Harcourt, Brace and
have been there ever since. Today I read a great deal — inevitably
for business, but also for pleasure; I take photographs and sail a
boat; I vote Democratic; I am, despite those enroaching shambles,

optimistic about the economic and political future of America.
If only we can preserve our sense of humor as we grow older...

WRITING these few paragraphs is interesting and good disci-
pline. In the first place the Twenty-fifth biography comes at a
significant time in most lives. At this “point of no return” most
of us have to settle for what we are doing now as the main effort
of our lives. In most aspects of our living we have accepted the
fact that the possibiliry of a major change of direction has quietly
passed us by without our having been aware of it.

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

I am a New Yorker by birth, convenience, and, to some extent,
conviction. Most of my school life was spent in the Lincoln School
of Teachers College, one of the great progressive schools of its
era. From there I went directly to Harvard College and then to
the Graduate School. I thoroughly enjoyed my five and one-half
years at Harvard, both academic and extra-curricular. I remember
I once wrote an operetta for Lowell House which had the timely
but ridiculous theme that if Hitler ever tried to take over Harvard
he would be defeated by Harvard indifference. In those distant,
nostalgic days the Harvardman’s aversion to many of the tra-
ditional patriotic observances — football rallies, fraternal cere-
monies, etc. seemed to set him further apart from the main
collegiate stream than he actually was.

My first marriage took place right after graduate school and
in almost the same breath we were off for England and Vienna
for nine months’ further music study. In England I worked
under Stanley Chapple at the London Academy of Music, taking
a long Christmas breather to go to Vienna for some composition
lessons with Egon Wellecz. Traveling across Europe, my wife
and I were no more aware of the seriousness of matters than any
other Americans of that time. I still remember our surprise at
being relieved of the Saturday Evening Post as undesirable litera-
ture on the train going through Germany.

On my return from Europe I found a job teaching music at the
Poughkeepsie Day School, a parents’ cooperative “progressive”
school, where I stayed nine years, until my Army service in 1943.
During my Poughkeepsie stay my two boys, Victor King, ’57, and
Kenneth Royce were born. I worked enjoyably early and late at
the school — music interspersed with manual labor, for the old
private house in which the school was and is lodged needed
large amounts of work by anyone willing. I took part in dramatic
productions at the experimental theatre at Vassar College and
wrote some music, among other efforts an orchestra piece which
was performed at Vassar by the local symphony orchestra, and
incidental music for a Vassar theatre production, “Santos Vega,”
a South American Gaucho drama. During this period I also
worked part time for a year at the Little Red School House in
New York City.

My Army career, from 1943 to 1946, was spent as a member of

[ 687 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

the 355th A.S.F. Band at Camp Barclay, Abilene, Texas; Darnall

Hospital, Danville, Kentucky; and Camp Atterbury, Indiana. My

most interesting Army experience was directing a choir of mental

patients at Darnall Hospital. Right after the war my wife and I

were divorced.

In 1946 I went to Juilliard School of Music for what I thought
was to be a brief brush-up —I stayed four years. My field was
composition and I found going back to school at thirty-six was
both difficult and rewarding. At the same time I had my first taste
of “working my way through.” I taught at the Dalton School
while I was studying at Juilliard. This experience taught me
some of the hardships of working one’s way through, notably the
lack of time for normal social relations with fellow students, which
are tremendously important to a musician. -

In 1947 I married again and we have a daughter, Robin Gail,
now four years old. My boys are grown. Victor finished Harvard
last spring and is now on the staff of the Charlotte (North
Carolina) Observer. Kenneth, after one year at Harvard, left to
work in California and is now finishing college at the University
of San Francisco.

My present status is one of much work and somewhat divided
although complementary allegiances. I am music director of the
New Lincoln School (a continuation of the Lincoln School I
attended); I teach children’s classes and direct a young players’
orchestra at the Mannes College of Music; and I teach teachers to
teach music at Bank Street College of Education. My wife teaches
at the Bank Street College Children’s School. For the past fifteen
years I have been teaching music at the Vassar Summer Institute
during the month of July. Since the war we have taken our hard-
earned recreation during the month of August at Cape Cod. We
keep a very small boat at Cotuit Harbor, and enjoy going to
auctions, occasionally buying something.

Professionally and philosophically I am and have been pretty
heavily committed to the “progressive” side of education and see
no real contradiction between this point of view and an acceptably
thorough education in any terms, My main interest at present is
in discovering what aspects of music are most interesting to what
ages. (I spent three winters, for instance, doing recreational
music with older people at the Cold Spring Institute.) Out of

[ 688 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

these interests I am developing a curriculum of music which will
provide the individual with an adequate background for enjoying
and using music in an active, participative way, both as a listener
and as a doer. As part of this curriculum development comes a
consideration of music as part of the larger school curriculum
and as a dynamic aspect of our society. These considerations
have led me to an interest in the recreational side of music as con-
trasted with the professional side, although I see many bridges
and no insuperable barrier between these two functions of music
in our culture.

Politically, I am a “liberal,” which has meant pragmatically
that I voted for Roosevelt but don’t consider Hoover an ogre.
My educational affiliations incline me to favor many kinds of
government social programs and I am willing to pay my share of
the taxes to get them. At the same time I am heartily in favor of
decentralization in the administration of these programs and hope
that we can meet the challenge of the future without having to
organize ourselves out of the undeniable advantages of personal
freedoms that we have so far managed to retain. I was born and
brought up a Methodist but at present have no religious affiliations.

lars a week. Shortly after graduation I was employed by the
Atherton Furniture Company in Lewiston, Maine, as a truck-
man’s helper. The fact that my major was Romance Languages
I think qualified me for this job. In January, 1934, I transferred
to the company’s Portland, Maine, store and have been here ever
since. In 1954 was elected president of the company.

In 1942 my wife and I moved to the country, to a house we
built in the middle of twenty-two acres. We wanted plenty
of room in which to roam. We do a considerable amount of
roaming during the summer, most of it behind lawn mowers,
since there is over an acre of lawn to mow.

Spare time, all too little of it lately, is spent in pursuit of a
variety of hobbies. My interests vary from books and antiques
to cabinet-making and welding. The years at college were full
and good years as have been the twenty-five since graduation
and I am looking forward to the next twenty-five with anticipa-
tion.

THE winter following our graduation in Cambridge, Manuel
Fenollosa and I found ourselves sharing the top floor of an early
nineteenth-century brick house on Christopher Street in New
York's Greenwich Village. The doorway had Doric columns
and a fan light, and with its several neighbors the building had
been painted white, so that the row looked both picturesque

[ 6g2 ]

and dignified, at least on the postcards you could buy at nearby
newsstands. These cards made our parents less nervous about
the address; fortunately they never saw even pictures of the in-
terior of the apartment.

It had been furnished some years before in a style known as
“colonial maple.” There was a chest of drawers in the living
room, stained maple brown, which defied opening on rainy days
— and it seemed to us that it rained continuously that winter —
and there was a lop-sided sort-of love seat with arms and slatback
of the same wood, which may have been maple for all we knew.
There was a folding “dinette” table, at least five upright chairs,
more “kitchen” than “colonial” in shape, and even a standing
lamp of the stuff. The scars and cracks and cigarette burns of
former tenants somehow didn’t make it all look antique but only
shabby and forlorn. This living room had a studio couch where
I slept. I had to move the table or put down one leaf in order
to get in bed and once there had to be careful of a couple of holes
in the mattress and treacherous spring ends. The bedroom was
only slightly larger than the second studio couch, big enough
in fact so that if he stood at one side Fenny could open the
drawers of his chest, that is if it hadn’t been raining too much.
The bathroom must at one time have been a hallway, for it was
long and narrow. wit also required maneuvering, to get by the
tub to the wash basin at the far end without becoming smudged
with brownish plaster. As the winter progressed this had begun
to swell menacingly and take on the appearance of a malignant
fungus. I realize now that the roof above was leaking into that
wall, but at that time, although we laughed at it a good deal, it
seemed like an evil omen. |

The apartment was either cold, with a penetrating rawness,
or breathlessly overheated and fetid. Convinced that our health
was threatened, we used to come home in the gloom, don sweat
suits and go run around the dark, muddy expanse of Wash-
ington Square. In varying degrees, we hated our apartment,
hated Greenwich Village, hated New York and hated Macy’s
where we spent nine hours a day. I would have been surprised
if Fenny didn’t also hate me, for I persuaded him to apply for
work at Macy’s and come live with me in New York.

Twenty-four years later, I live scarcely 1000 feet away and I

himself, there is considerable creative satisfaction in finding a
good manuscript, guiding it until it has become a physical book
of appropriate and attractive form, and then launching it into
the world as well as possible. This is particularly true in a small
house, where the whole process can be in a person’s hands, or
at least under his direction. But publishing, even in a small firm
like New Directions that doesn’t have to make money (but some-
times does), is a great deal more a business activity than most
outsiders realize. We don’t sit in our offices all day reading like-
able books: in fact most necessary reading is done late at night
and on weekends. Nor is it so glamorous. One must be unim-
pressed by the glamor of famous writers — or theatre people, as
in the case of some of our authors at Theatre Arts Books — and
see problems as hard-headedly as if they were any other business
problems. However, it ends up that a great deal of my social
and private life is connected with writers and book people, and
friendships with them have proved stimulating and personally
enriching.

One of the hardest lessons to learn in New York, I think, is
that one cannot see and hear everything this fabulous city has
to offer. One must discipline one’s self against over-dispersion,
overstimulation for that matter. This goes for plays, concerts
and exhibitions; but they are all a part of the rewarding life
here. I try to follow only certain lines of interest and I also try
to be following at least one that doesn’t have anything to do with
my business. This is not always easy, for almost anything can
be turned into publishable material. Last summer, for instance,
I took a course in Buddhist art, which I wish I had known more
about when I was in Peking. It opened up whole new worlds,
but of course I now see all sorts of possibilities of publishing
books in the area. This process helps to provide variety and
space in a life rhat is largely devoted to details that are not inter-
esting in themselves.

The turbulent thirties forestalled too much settling down.
With the recession, the Avrerican folded. I turned to commercial
publicity and then struck out as a free-lance writer. Hitler’s move

A SCHOOL teacher — that is what I am — now in my second
year of practice — not long for your classmate twenty-five years
out of college. Well —there it is: I’m only a beginner in a very
tough art (related to lion-taming or tightrope walking), winning
no laurels, but hopeful of success. It’s nice to have a saleable and
useful profession.

I’m addressing this little account to my good friends of Harvard
days and ask their forgiveness of my neglect of them over these
years. I do not know for sure why I have not pursued old friend-
ships —it may be just a chronic uncertainty about myself. I
am deeply attached to old chums of Glee Club, Lowell House and
Adams House, football and rowing, and Fogg Museum and other
haunts.

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

I am a lonely wanderer in this life, seeking that quaint goal,
a vocation. During the last seven years I have found it, so that
I can stand among men, thus far evolved —I am a painter of
pictures, an artist. Yes, | am at heart an artist. I relish a life of
freedom in pursuit of the beautiful and the grand, yet I have put
myself in harness to the Board of Education of the City of New
York in order to be at peace with my art. My work I place where
it will give pleasure, often demanding a small price in earnest of
appreciation.

What do I paint? By choice, I paint representations of the
works of man in sculpture and in architecture — thus interiors,
exteriors and street scenes. I am a plain artist — no studio life for
me. My great delight is in the churches of the city; my longing is
to travel in the twilight glory of Europe and to capture its splendor
before the Armageddon. Asia also beckons and Central America,
North Africa and the Near East — life is so short and I have
scarcely made a start — could I but start with Ravenna, Italy!

My brave wife, Madeline Mason, herself a fine artist of poetry
(The Cage of Years, Bond Wheelwright, 1949; also lecturer at
Library of Congress, 1956, and at Edinburgh Festival, 1955), has
encouraged me in this erratic choice of vocation, i.e., erratic for
one born into a family of industrialists (my old parents are now
resigned to my vocation). My twelve years in the chemical indus-
try indicated much artistic interest in plant atmosphere and an
appreciation of the sweet qualities of working folk, but no talent
for business affairs.

My wife and I united during my less than glorious military
service, exploring the mystical adventure of marriage. We have
an idyllic retreat in the Catskill Mountains. It is called Casa
Benita and we divide the year between that place and the
metropolis. ;

Art, philosophy and education have brought me and my wife
into recurring fellowship with the family of Henry Barnes, our
fellow classmate, who has devoted his great talents to the mystical
philosophy and educational system of the Austrian, Rudolph
Steiner. It is through Steiner’s revelations that I hope to overcome
an aversion to modern science, to learn who I am and how to live
in the spirit. I worship God in a mission of the Episcopal Church

among the Negroes and Puerto Ricans of the Lower East Side,
singing lustily in the choir. I must learn Spanish.
God love you all and unite us in fellowship.

OCCUPATION: Deputy assistant director, C.I.A.

THIS is a Jast minute postscript to a photograph which I assume
reached the committee weeks ago. At the time, my wife insisted
gently that it was unseemly to be without a portrait at my age.
The picture was taken, even as my will was made. With this
difference: the picture was free; the will was not. And now I
feel an obligation to say something, if only to acknowledge that
the picture was of me. But of me and the last quarter century,
that remains to be seen. I can account for my time but not yet
for the times and me. There are, of course, times when I think
I almost can, but this is not one of them. The piece I did on
time was thought unsuitable, and I always follow my wife’s ad-
vice, when she sticks to the role of consulting engineer.

Before the war I prepared for and entered the teaching pro-
fession. I don’t know that I was more distracted than others by
the world outside but I do have vivid memories of a continuous
political debate going on while I was trying to study. A year
in Europe, Germany, after college did much to prepare me. I
remain grateful that my last year in Cambridge was spent in
the Dean’s office. Despite the troubled world, the Dean’s office
was steady on its course and I left Harvard the better for the
happy associations which were mine from that year.

When we were at last forced into the war, I had to all appear-
ances settled down — to teach and study and to establish my own

[ 702 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

household. My wife thought home should always be in her
native Connecticut River town among friends and relatives. We
clung to the idyll. I suppose we knew it would be broken but
hoped it could be put back whole. I had barely time to finish
my teaching in summer school and bid my wife and week-old
son goodbye before reporting for active duty. The transition
was abrupt and the dislocation would have been laming indeed
had my assignment in the Navy not been so interesting that I
lost my customary sense of self, all my wits absorbed in watching
a strange and violent world. At the end of the war in Europe I
was sent to England to write history. Instead of relaxing as I
was told I might I worked the harder to make my separation date
as clear as possible of unfinished business. No man was ever
happier to return to home and family. I was exhausted but
buoyed up by the idyll of a New England village green.

My most difficult decision came the following year: to leave
teaching and rejoin the government service. It remains a diffi-
cult decision. It was very hard on my family. I know my ig-
norance was very great of the principalities and powers that be
and how they may and may not affect one. But the recording
of history drew me from the record itself and I thought I could
see emerging in fact great issues of time itself. Power and ideas,
ideas and power.

Of the last ten years, nine have been spent in Washington
(C.I.A.) and one in Princeton (visiting fellow). All have been
so busy that time turned into a race. Meanwhile the children
marked my age for me and now begin to ambush me from the
domestic rear. Happily there is nothing hostile in the ambush,
at least nothing intentionally harmful, but there is a fair amount
of noise, and all too frequently demands for things I know noth-
ing about. A solar battery, a cat’s skeleton, or a better clarinet.
We have recently moved into our own house in the woods, in
an area which I hope will remain country as long as the children
are with us. My wife and I already find the results promising
in drawing the children closer to us and to one another after
so many years of suburban competition for their attention.

In the greater new suburbia, which everyone writes about, I
have taken little or no part. I am too conservative to feel at home
in what strikes me as a hopeless confusion of functions among

[ 703 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

school, church, home and the numerous lesser forms of com-
munity. I have reacted so strongly against some contemporary
cultural and social expressions that my children may regard me,
at times, as an ancient — solitary, withdrawn and irascible. If
so, it does not break the natural bond of affection for they have
more than an inkling, I do believe, of what has strained their
parents so in passage from the provincial world in which they
were formed into the present turbulence. And my sympathies
are theirs, for the strain on them is obvious. My regret will be
that I could give so little to them, even of time.

OccUPATION: Psychiatrist.

OFFICES HELD: Various positions on psychiatric staff of the faculties of
Medical School and Graduate School of University of Pennsylvania,
culminating in assistant professorships in each, 1953-54.

DURING my junior year at Harvard I wrote my father a letter
in which I stated that, although I did not know what vocation I
wanted to pursue, I was at least unequivocally certain about two
things: I would never be a lawyer, and I would never be a doctor.
Having thus committed myself, I suppose it is not surprising that
four years later I should be enrolled as a first-year medical student
at Johns Hopkins. After the eventual completion of my intern-
ship I taught pharmacology for a year at the University of
Pennsylvania Medical School, and then went into the Air Force
where I spent the majority of three years indoctrinating cadets
in high altitude physiology — high altitude for 1943, that is. By
the time I was discharged it seemed to me that I must be the most
diversely educated medical officer in the service, having been to

[ 704 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

Carlisle Barracks, flight surgeon at Randolph Field, School of
Aviation Physiology, and having been exposed, in addition,
to courses in oxygen equipment, chemical warfare, and jungle
survival.

The course in aviation psychiatry proved more important to me
than I thought at the time, for it led, deviously, to my going into
psychiatry after the war —a branch of medicine which I have
variously found satisfying, puzzling and frustrating, although
always challenging. I became a board diplomate in 1951.

My interests have gradually but definitely shifted from an
emphasis on sports to the various activities that are connected
with the maintenance of garden, orchard and a sizeable woodlot.
With the time that is left over after these demands, and the
responsibilities of my practice, are satisfied, I am interested in
woodworking, collecting early American implements, reading,
our Hammond chord-organ, and the inevitable fascination with
Hi-Fi.

FOLLOWING graduation and, in a sincere but perhaps futile
attempt at becoming a lawyer, I enrolled in Columbia University
School of Law. Upon graduation in 1936 and admission to prac-
tice, there ensued a painful indoctrination in an attempt to earn
a living in private practice.

Somewhat disillusioned, I was attracted to government service
by an offer from Washington as an opinion attorney in the Fed-

[ 705 J

eral Works Agency. Then the usual pattern took over. In Wash-
ington it seems no one stays very long with any one agency or
body. I was no different. There followed an appointment as
trial attorney for the Labor Department (New York), chief of
the Opinion Section (Washington) and regional attorney (Bos-
ton) for the Federal Works Agency and finally chief construc.
tion attorney for the Federal Public Housing Authority (New
York City). | |

In September, 1942, my life took a different turn. I became
legal assistant or secretary to Hon. Edward S. Dore, Justice of
the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court and a member of
the busiest court in the world. For the next five years I was
immersed in the toughest assignment of my life. For seven days
a week, ten months of each year, seventeen hours a day my life
was confined to the reading and digest of briefs and to research
in law. No wonder then that in June of 1947, I eagerly accepted
the nomination as Democratic candidate for Municipal Court
Justice.

Elected, I have just completed ten happy and contented years,
feeling that I have managed to help a goodly number of people
resolve some of their problems.

Between my peregrinations, I managed to acquire a wife, three
daughters and a female dog. I don’t subscribe to its being “a
man’s world.” Should any of you find yourself in the vicinity
of Lake Sunapee, New Hampshire, during the summer months

MY business life since graduation has been spent in merchandising

Family life with a nice wife and two wonderful boys is the
necessary offset to the hectic world of business. My principal
avocation is golf in which I have attained.a degree of proficiency
(in the low 80's) consistent with our business. It is said that a
retailer has neglected his business when he shoots in the 70’s con-

As for travel, there is a substantial amount of same connected
with my business, including several European trips since 1946.
During the war, I spent several years (1943-46) at the Navy
Purchasing Office, Newport, Rhode Island, as contracting officer
in procurement and contract terminations. I am an independent

MEDICINE has always been considered one of the noblest and
most rewarding of the professions. Among the subdivisions of
medicine, otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat, to you) has been
a shining bright star for the last decade or two.

But it was not always so, At first, I was a general practitioner
in Springfield, Massachusetts. Many a night, my bride, Edith
Sahpiro, would get up with me at three a.m., throw a coat over
her nightgown (the one with the fur on the bottom) and wait
in the car while I gave a hypo to some poor soul with a heart
attack, or with a misbehaving gall bladder, kidney, or what have
you. Those were exciting days and the work was important,
for the general practitioner is still the backbone of medicine. But
it was hard, very hard. So when, after five years, I was offered
that rare pearl, a gem usually denied to ordinary mortal men,
in the form of a two-year residency at the Columbia-Presbyterian
Medical Center, I closed my office, Edith went back to work,
and I became an otolaryngologist.

Otolaryngology, at that time, was a “dying specialty.” Penicil-
lin had recently been discovered and cured most ear, nose and
throat infections before serious complications, such as mastoiditis,
throat abscesses, etc., developed. Humanity benefited, but the
ear, nose and throat surgeon \ was left with little more than tonsils
to work on.

Medicine, however, is not static; she marches on. While mor-
bidity and mortality from serious infections were decreasing to
the vanishing point, in their place came a demand for plastic sur-
gery, surpassing anything that could have been dreamed of in
the previous generation. And yet it was a natural outgrowth
coupled to our increasingly better living standards as well as to
our unfortunate habit of judging people by externals. Why
should anybody tolerate a deformity of the nose or ears when

[713]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

such deformities were so easily corrected? And who could cor-
rect them better than the ENT man who knew the anatom
and diseases of the entire head and neck inside, outside and back-
wards? (Adv.) So we learned how to do plastic surgery, a most
interesting field and a highly gratifying one to patient and sur-
geon alike.

At the same time, giant strides were being made towards help-
ing our millions of deaf people. First came the fenestration or
window operation and now, in very recent years, it is the stapes
mobilization operation and the various tympanoplasty procedures.
These operations are done with the aid of a microscope and are
considerably more delicate than fixing a fine watch. The modern
otolaryngologist cannot sit back and do what he did ten or twenty
years ago. He needs continuous study, training and mastery of
new techniques. Such continuous study, including attendance at
conventions in distant cities, enrolling in short courses and per-
fecting new methods in charity hospitals forces a man to stay
young (in mind, at least), otherwise he would surely find himself
on the shelf. You might call it a method of keeping the rust off
(the brain).

During all this time, three children somehow appeared. The
two boys keep fighting as to which of them will inherit my prac-
tice, while my baby girl, aged nine, can’t decide whether to be
a nurse or a medical secretary. And, naturally, Myron and Joe
study the violin, while Lynn studies the piano.

Hobbies: I have had, and still have, too many. Cruising in a
sailboat during the summer; skiing in the winter, and golf in
between. Square-dancing, too —silly, isn’t it? But in addition
to belonging to a couple of square dance clubs, I am the caller
and my wife and I teach our children, plus a couple of dozen
of their little friends. And, of course, I still play the fiddle like
mad, mostly solo work and in string quartets, music always has
and always will play a large part in my life. My children and
I are hopefully looking forward to the time when we shall be
able to play chamber music together.

Well, boys, we all change a lot in twenty-five years and the
world changes too. My feeling is that these changes have been
for the better. Let’s hope that it continues the same way, at least
until the Fiftieth.

IT seems in retrospect that for fifteen years after graduation my
principal accomplishment was to remain continuously employed.
I emerged from the Depression with a record of consecutive em-
ployment in a number of unpromising legal jobs. After Army
service I found myself again working for a well-known New
York law firm. Perhaps like many other 1933. graduates, I was
a round peg trying to fit into a square hole.

Then, in 1949, I stumbled into a potentially important anti-
trust suit. The clients, neighborhood launderette operators, could
not afford to pay fees in advance, a difficulty present in almost
any big case offered to an obscure lawyer. My employers had

[ 716 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

no incentive to take the risks involved. So I had to decline the
case or give up my job. Counsel for one of the prospective de-
fendants unwittingly helped to make up my mind by threatening
to sue me for libel if I proceeded. The libel suit was later brought
but was eventually dismissed.

With that one case, I opened a tiny office on January 1, 1949.
The case took seven years to complete, exhausting my small pat-
rimony. I worked many nights and weekends, often doing my
own typing in an effort to match the flood of papers turned out
by the defendants. The litigation grew until I represented 169
small businessmen. There were two six-weck trials, one with
a hung jury, and an appeal. While we were industriously pre-
paring for a third trial, the litigation was settled.

Even though my gamble succeeded, I cannot recommend a
similar one to other lawyers. The mere complexity of legal
procedure, with attendant expense and delay, lends itself to abuse
by defendants. Few laymen, and not even all lawyers, realize
how long a well-heeled defendant can stave off a trial. A few
months ago a theatre owner whom I represent telephoned me.
He complained that he was reading newspaper accounts of the
then current trial of Samuel G oldwyn’s anti-trust case against
Twentieth-Century-Fox and others, while I had not yet been able
to bring to trial his case which had been filed in 1954. He was
astonished to hear that Mr. Goldwyn’s case had been filed in
1950 and had taken seven years to reach trial.

Moreover, the anti-trust laws have suffered a great loss of pop-
ular and judicial support, This is due partly to prolonged pros-
perity and partly to corporate propaganda. General Electric, for
example, tells millions of listeners that progress is its most im-
portant product. But few people hear of the instances in which
G.E.’s cartel arrangements with Krupp were considered by the
Department of Justice to be the cause of American inferiority
in 1942 in cemented tungsten carbide and other sinews of war.

Thus, even before 1955, when my first case was settled, it had
become apparent that representing small businessmen in anti-
trust litigation was not likely to provide financial security. Early
in 1955 I organized Silicon Corporation of America to back
some bright young engineers. That was an exciting enterprise.
While continuing to practise law, I was active in the company,

poration. I have learned almost too late that business can be
much more creative than law. Accordingly, I’ve come to divide
my working time about equally between law and business.

In 1955, with the settlement of my first case, I felt free to re-
marry. Audrey, University of California and Hastings Law
School, is one of those rarely perceptive persons who prefers
New York to California. Shortly before my forty-third birth.
day, I discovered the joys of parenthood. Surprisingly, the years
appear to have increased my ability to withstand patiently the
onslaughts of a small boy. After twenty years of litigation the
traditional irritations of bringing up baby seem rather minor.

THE twenty-five years from 1933 to 1958 have been good years
for me. My career has progressed along normal lines and my
work has been as interesting as one can realistically expect in the
ordinary routine of business, The only interruption to my busi-
ness career was my service in the Army from 1943 to 1946.

All my energies have been devoted to retailing. From 1933 to
1940, it was the retail furniture business and from 1940 to 1958,
it has been, and still is, the men’s retail clothing business. At the
present time I am associated with the Linpark Clothing Corpora-
tion, a men’s clothing chain. My office is at 1107 Broadway, New
York City. .

In January of 1951, I was married to Helen Edelstein, My
strongest interests outside of my work are music and reading. For
exercise I saw wood to be used in our fireplace.

It is an odd circumstance that this Twenty-fifth Reunion seems
to coincide with a point in my life when I can begin to relax a
little bic and look forward to having the leisure to do so many
things that I have wanted to do but never could find time to do
during these last twenty-five years.

Attorney’s office in New York City, where I had an interesting
time and obtained a varied experience in criminal prosecutions.
In December, 1941, I resigned to enlist in the Marine Corps. After
a year in the Caribbean I was sent to Officer Candidate School in
Quantico, where my interest was not limited to strictly military
tactics. In the spring of 1943 I won a commission and a bride.
Four children (including a pair of twins) followed in rapid
succession, despite an overseas interlude of several months.

In March, 1946, I shed the uniform and resumed the practice of
law, this time with my father’s firm. With the exception of an
assignment as special prosecutor in charge of the prosecution of
the so-called second-string Communists in New York I have con-
tinued the general practice of the law.

In 1953, by this time with six children, we moved from Ridge-
wood to Westport, mainly to be near salt water, We bought an
old house, and when I am not busy shoring up floors and repair-
ing plaster, I seem to be occupied in digging dry wells. To com-
bine gardening and sailing seems to be a difficult feat, but we try
to accomplish both with the help of child labor.

Personal and professional life has been very satisfying. I] hope
that my children will grow up in a world which will permit them
equal or greater happiness.

HAVING spent approximately a year and a half in Spain,
France and Italy, and been fortunate enough during the still
existing depression to have had several short-lived jobs, I joined
W. R. Grace and Company, New York, in January, 1935, as
office boy, mail room boy, trainee, etc. In September, of the
same year, after a transfer to Grace Lines, Inc., I was shipped
to Santiago, Chile, where I joined the Steamer Department of
Grace y Cia., Chile, S.A. I was promoted to manager of the
Steamer Department in 1939, and continued in that position until
the fall of 1941, at which time I was appointed executive secre-
tary of the Coordination Committee for Chile, representing Mr.
Nelson A. Rockefeller, the coordinator of Inter-American affairs.
I returned to the United States in April, 1944, with the hope
and expectation of serving in the Navy, but health reasons frus-
trated this plan. Accordingly, I accepted appointment as assistant
director of the Regional Division, Office of the Coordinator of
Inter-American Affairs, in Washington and continued in that
office until its amalgamation with the Department of State.

[721]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

Shortly thereafter, at the invitation of Commissioner Richard
Parkhurst, I became his assistant in the Maritime Commission,
and in 1948, was appointed general manager of the Commission,

In 1950, I resigned from the Commission and joined the Asso-

ciated Latin-American Freight Conferences in New York, as
assistant to the chairman and, in 1954, was appointed vice-
chairman.

During my stay in Chile, I met, became engaged and was
married to Margaret Wilson Fisher of Oakland, California, a
graduate of the University of California, who had been invited
by the University of Chile to pursue her studies for an A.M. in
Spanish literature, and at the same time to lecture on contem-
porary American literature at the university. Our first son, John
Knox, was born in Santiago in 1942; our daughter, Anne Elis-
abeth, in Oakland, California, in 1944, shortly after our return
to the United States; our third child, James Curtiss, in Greenwich,
Connecticut, in 1953, completing our present family.

While sailing has always been my first love, we enjoyed golf
and riding in Chile, but now, again on salt water (we are per-
manently located in Greenwich, Connecticut), sailing and, shame-
facedly, even powerboating now take first place as an outside
interest. John has inherited his father’s interest and surpassed
his father’s ability as a racing sailor, having won the Midget
Championship of Long Island Sound in 1956, and amassed a
collection of silverware in 1956 and 1957. Anne also shows keen

interest, with James a potential spinnaker man. John is pres-
ently an eleventh grader at the Brunswick School in Greenwich,
with sights trained on M.LT. His scholastic standing is a sub-
stantial improvement on his father’s record. Anne attends Rose-
mary Hall in Greenwich, where she is presently in the Third
Form. Her scholastic ability is likewise a source of satisfaction
and perhaps some pleasant surprise, she having won the Caroline
Ruutz-Rees competitive scholarship in 1956, which she continues
to hold. James’ formal education does not yet permit of such
satisfactory reporting, but if the ingenuity of that four and one-
half-year-old is any indication of his future ability, we need not
be unduly alarmed.
The future promises continued residence in Greenwich and
the commuter’s life to New York.

MEMBER OF: Gloucester Rotary Club.

MY first real job was with the Norfolk County Trust Company
in Brookline, Massachusetts, devoting my time to loans and invest-
ments. This type of work appealed to me so much that I decided
to go into the investment securities business for myself, which I
did in 1937, forming a corporation under my own name and
dealing in municipal bonds and other unlisted securities. These
years were happy and educational, but were terminated shortly
after Pearl Harbor because I could see no immediate future for
me in the investment business under existing circumstances.

In 1942 I went to work for the D. O. Frost Company in
Gloucester, Massachusetts, where I have been ever since. During
the war years we worked for the Army, Navy and the Coast
Guard on a variety of products, mostly selling Cadillacs for the
price of Chevrolets. Now we concentrate on industrial protective
clothing made mostly from rubber or plastic —and still selling
Cadillacs for the price of Chevrolets.

Our marriage took place in 1935, shortly after I had received
my first raise in salary. I cannot compliment Dottie enough for
these happy years and fervently pray there will be many, many
more of them. We have two wonderful children. Dave is now
in his junior year at the University of Maine and Betsy is com-

pleting her last year of junior high school. They grow up all too
soon.
One of the nicest parts of my work is living in Rockport —
ten minutes commuting time, a lovely seaside town with an
abundance of beaches, gardens and artists; quite a change from
apartment and city living of the earlier days. As for hobbies, I
suppose gardening would be at the head of the list, with bass
fishing and duck hunting close behind, although those cold morn-
ings in the duck blind seem to appeal somewhat less as the years
roll on. Looking back, it does not seem as though twenty-five
years have skipped by since 1933. I don’t think I feel older, but
the mirror says I am. This is further confirmed in competition
with the children, Somebody said, “Youth is a great commodity.”
How true! One other quote: “It is enough to grow old — but
the alternative is worse.” How true!

occuPATION: Sales; folding cartons corporation.

AFTER graduation I spent a year at the Law School, after which
I had to go to work; and in 1934 this seemed easier said than done.
Finally I became a house-to-house salesman for Iron Fireman in
Chicago and continued this broadening education for about a
year. At this point I was a good deal more aware of the world
around me than I had been. In the process of trying to sell some
coal stokers to a folding carton manufacturer with a brand new
plant containing brand new oil burners, found myself employed
by him as a trainee, at a considerable reduction in income.
Certainly it was no less than I was worth to the Chicago Carton

[724]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

Company; but I have never regretted the change, for I have re-
mained in the folding carton business, with a few deviations, ever
since.

The war severed this pleasant relationship in 1943, when I
joined the Marines as a private. 1 made O.CS. and the 42nd
R.O.C. I was admitted to the Aviation Ground Officers’ School,
under Frank Chapman, and went to school and finally became an
instructor at N.R.T.S., St. Simons, Georgia. This was the training
school for Naval and Marine fighter directors, and a lovely spot,
but conscience overtook me and I made it overseas barely in time
for the Okinawa invasion.

After The Bomb I was made, among other things, the laundry
officer of our group. This post carried with it the perquisite of
a large truck (for delivering and picking up laundry) which
enabled me to carry many thirsty marines from our hilltop home
to the Naval B.O.Q. on the beach; without which service our
casualties would undoubtedly have been much higher.

This excellent duty was terminated by my being sent home, on
points, in time for Christmas in 1945. Since I had been the proud
recipient of a “Dear John” letter, homecoming was a bit more un-
certain than might be expected under ordinary circumstances;
but thanks to many dear friends, it became one of the merriest
Christmases ever. During the holiday season I met a lovely girl,
my present wife, and went to work for the late Ernest Byfield,
president of the Sherman and Ambassador Hotels, as his assistant.
In the confusion of events I neglected to return to Chicago Carton
Company.

Next on the program, my wife announced that we were about
to become parents at some uncertain date, and that we had better
get out of the hotel business if we expected to have a normal
family life. I had an opportunity to move east as assistant general
manager of Indiana Steel Products Company, and took it. Our
firstborn occurred prematurely, shortly after we moved, but
survived in fine shape. Unfortunately the business venture, which
involved erecting a new plant, was not a success, and the plant
was closed in a little less than two years, Rather than move back
to Chicago with Indiana Steel, I chose to remain in the Fast,
especially in view of the fact that my wife was again in what is
laughingly called an interesting condition.

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

This involved seeking other employment, and after vicissitudes
both too painful and too tedious to mention, | became New
York district sales manager for Edwin J. Schoettle Company, a
folding carton manufacturer. Differences of opinion as to policy
led to my leaving them after a year, and early in 1949 I joined my
present employer, the Gardner Division of the Diamond Gardner
Corporation, one of the largest folding carton manufacturers there
is. I now manage the eastern sales of the Retail Box Department
of this company.

My hobbies have been fairly consistent: music and photography,
with a little fishing thrown in when I had time. We have also had
five children, with a sixth due in March. I became a baptized
Catholic sometime after my marriage in’ 1946, my first marriage
having been annulled on a technicality.

In looking back on my life, I can see many places where my
decisions might have been wrong; but in view of the present, I
cannot honestly say that I would like to change any of them.
With a fine family, good friends and work that I enjoy, I have no
complaints, but only hope for the future.

WHEN I was in the insurance business shortly after leaving
college, a fellow underwriter and former classmate at Harvard
came into the office one morning visibly very depressed. When I
asked him what ailed him, he said, “This is my birthday, I am
twenty-five years old today and what have I accomplished?” As
I look back now over the last twenty-five years, I sometimes
wonder what I have accomplished, certainly not as much as some,
quite probably more than others. At any rate, it has been a happy
period and a busy one, as you can see.

It was a bad time to go out and face the world, if you remember.
For those of us who were not going on to Graduate School it
was a problem to find a job. Some took positions as runners on
the stock market in New York, later to become bond salesmen, etc.
I started my business career as a life underwriter (insurance
salesman) in Boston and went to work on my friends and relatives
in order to “plan their estates” and incidentally make a modest
living from commissions. After that I went to work for the
Federal Housing Administration selling people on the idea of
borrowing money from the government to build game rooms and
breezeways in homes soon to be lost by mortgage foreclosure.

In May of 1935, I had a chance to take a real job, that is one with
a salary and other nice benefits. So I started work with the L. F.
Fales Machine Company of Walpole, Massachusetts. My field
in college having been languages and literature, I fitted right in
with a firm manufacturing grey iron castings and machinery. At
first I was office boy, clerk, apprentice bookkeeper and general
office handyman, The pay was small but it was steady.

Fortunately, the business grew and, with the help of some
courses in bookkeeping and accounting, I grew with it. And the
clerical staff grew as social security, withholding taxes, group
insurance and labor unions appeared. From three people in the
office we progressed to five, to ten, to fifteen and up. On the
strength of this I married and settled down to raise a family and
take my place in the affairs of a small New England town.

When World War II came, after an unsuccessful attempt to

[727]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

get into the Navy, I joined the U.S. Coast Guard Temporar
Reserve and spent four years of part-time patrol duty off the
Cape Cod Canal.

In 1943 we moved to Wrentham, Massachusetts, smaller and
more residential than Walpole, and here we have become rooted,
at least until our boys have homes of their own and our responsi-
bilities are over. Some day we want to travel.

As for hobbies, mine are hunting and photography. Dorothy’s
are varied, ranging from such activities as serving on the execu-
tive boards of various foundations to managing and running
fashion shows and other affairs for charity.

So now you know about me. I shall look forward to a “briefing”
on you and yours in anticipation of the Twenty-fifth.

BEYOND the inevitable aging process, there have been no sig-
nificant changes in my condition since our last report and I remain
happily content with the same family and job. My work, which
I find quite interesting and stimulating, is in the investment field
and involves the negotiation of corporate security issues (via

the direct placement route) and real estate transactions (mostly
of the sale-leaseback variety).

My community activities are currently limited to being a
church trustee and a Cubmaster. I have no particular hobbies
but enjoy reading, golf, tennis, sporadic attempts to paint, family
life, parties and summers in Maine. My ideas in most areas, polit-
ical and otherwise, would be regarded as unprogressive by the
avant garde. In short, I am obviously a thoroughly dull subject
for a class history.

STAFFING and supervising the secondary schools of Hartford,
catering to the reasonable demands of a wonderful wife and two
fine children, attempting to get settled in a new home, and playing
a minor role in the activities of my community, I am very busy but
thoroughly happy.

At the age of three, when most boys were dreaming of becom-
ing a policeman or a cowboy, I decided, for reasons unknown,
that I wanted to be a teacher; and I never departed from that desire

[ 730 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

in either school or college. Therefore, in 1933, against the
admonition of many self-appointed but well-meaning counselors,
I entered the teaching profession and there have remained ever
since. These past twenty-five years, though somewhat lean at
times, have been challenging and rewarding. From a selfish point
of view, I teach because I enjoy my contacts with young people
and books; from a more altruistic point of view, I teach because
the public schools, which I believe are the bulwark of our
American way of living, need many dedicated souls to fight to
the very end to preserve the sound principles upon which they
were founded and to maintain reasonable cultural standards.

When my friends and neighbors greeted me in 1942, it looked
for a time as though I might be released from teaching, at least
temporarily; but such was not the case, Assigned to the Medical
Corps of the Army, almost immediately I found myself in charge
of a classroom, at first for enlisted men and later, after I had be-
come a ninety-day wonder, for officers. Eventually I directed a
school at which I trained physicians and dentists to teach enlisted
men to become skilled litter-bearers and medical technicians. Of
course this assignment neither took me around the world nor
entitled me to wear an imposing array of battle ribbons, but it
was an interesting experience and helped to make my forty-two
months of service pass relatively quickly.

At this point, the war years seem remote. My daughter, who
was born while I was in the Army, is now preparing for college
and my son has passed the age when my few army relics appeal
to him. Ellen and John are rather typical, carefree youngsters
who cause my wife and me great concern one minute and astound
us with their words of wisdom the next. I am happy to report
that my daughter already shows signs of developing into a good
bridge player.

Yes, bridge still remains one of my favorite pastimes. My wife
and I play the game often and regardless of where we have
lived have always been fortunate in finding friends who share
our interest. Reading and gardening also help me to use my
leisure pleasantly,

My outlook on life has not changed substantially since I was
in college. I continue to go to church on Sunday and to support
the Republicans more frequently than the Democrats. Further-

[731]

more, I still subscribe to the philosophy which I adopted while
I was an undergraduate at Harvard; namely, that any intelligent
person can find true happiness. He needs only to identify that
which he wants most in life, devote himself wholeheartedly to
making this dream a reality, and then live in such a way that the
rest of his demands will conform to the restrictions that this
overpowering desire imposes upon him, It is a simple philosophy,
but it works.

Generally speaking, the years have been kind to me. To be
sure, my hair has turned to silver, wrinkles are beginning to ap-
pear, and my thinking tends’‘to be in tones of gray rather than in
pure white or jet black; but J have known no serious illness, and I
wear the same size suit now as I wore in college. Actually it is
difficult for me to realize that I am rapidly approaching fifty
rather than thirty,

THE first years after graduation were spent selling life insurance,
and not too much of it, in and around Boston. In 1939 I had a
chance to lease a small summer resort on Newfound Lake in New
Hampshire. I think the country air must have done something to
me because I have been here ever since, having purchased the
property after the first year.

The summer resort business in New Hampshire is a short one
due to its seasonal nature. This means six months of hard work
before, during and after the season and six months of no work and
no pay. This led me to establish the Bristol Locker Service where
we prepare meat and other products for lockers and home freezers.
When the freezer business is slow in the summer, the retail meat
business takes up the slack. In fact, the summer trade has become
so active that I sold the summer resort this past year so that I
could devote all my time to the locker service.

So many people, including some of my classmates, have asked —
me what we do for entertainment in the winter. This season
appears to last from Labor Day to the Fourth of July to some
of my friends. I love to hunt and fish and that goes for my wife
for fishing, I don’t know of any better way to stay young in
spirit at least and I am sure it is not conducive to ulcers. There
are just seven evenings in a week and it is a case of which
activity do you enjoy and not what shall we do tonight for excite-

ment.

occuPATION: Publishing; senior editor, Prentice-Hall, Inc.

MEMBER OF: New York County Lawyers’ Association.

THE Quindecennial Report (q.v., by all means) amply covered
the quindecennium. Synopsis: Harvard Law School, LL.B., ’36,
earned magno cum sudore (“by dint of great perspiration”).
Practised law in Chicago for seven years, including six years with
the Chicago Motor Club and affiliated corporations (working with
insurance, auto finance, taxation, legislation, etc.). Military serv-
ice from November, 1943, to December, 1945. Reached Nor-
mandy, July, 1944, and promptly caught spinal meningitis, fol-
lowed by post-meningeal arthritis and atypical pneumonia. In field
hospital, a circus tent, heard St. Ld bombing — indescribable. Re-
cuperated in England. In combat from the Bulge till V-E Day, as
rifleman and messenger, with Company A, 47th Regiment (Ninth
Division, First Army); later chief of the regiment’s Morning Re-
ports section (rank of technician 4th grade—T/q). The 47th
was the first infantry regiment to cross the Rhine. It won a Dis-
tinguished Unit citation in the Remagen bridgehead. Personal
awards: Bronze Star, Purple Heart. Just before entering the
Army, I had promised my mother and sister 'd join them later in
New York, and had made New York technically my residence.
Admitted to New York bar in 1947, after a year of refresher
courses. Also, in 1947, joined the editorial staff of Prentice-Hall,

[ 734]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

Inc., to help publish loose-leaf services on state and local taxation.
Still doing it — now as a senior editor.

It makes me a sort of reverse exurbanite. Five mornings a week,
when city-bound railways are filled, I take relatively empty cross-
town and uptown subways from Tudor City to the George
Washington Bridge, then a bus across and a mile north, to a long,
wide, low, glass-and-steel building that friends insist is my “ivory
tower.” Till now, state taxes have ranged below federal taxes in
general interest. However, a new age is dawning —the era of
interstate enforcement. The states are planning to get more of
their revenues from outsiders — out-of-state firms and individ-
uals, That will lead to complications — seizure of in-state property
and credits of balky taxpayers, local suits based on “substituted”
service of process (the Secretary of State mails the summons to the
out-of-state defendant), and suits brought in the defendant’s
home state. The states might even use what I term the “elephant
gun” —a suit begun directly in the U.S. Supreme Court. (Stu-
dents of constitutional law will remember Chisholm v. Georgia,
after which the Eleventh Amendment said states could shoot but
not be shot at.) The taxpayers’ poison will be my meat.

One avocation is collecting acutely pointed anecdotes, for tact-
ful use where needed. One gem is the observation of the foreign-
born business man after testing a dictation recording machine —
“Yah, iss vunderful like you say, but who vants a machine mit a
Cherman eccent?” Another is about the waiter who was asked by
Einstein (caught without his reading glasses) to read the menu
aloud. His reply: “Sir, I’m afraid I is just as ignorant as you is.”
And to my brother attorneys I confide the formalization of what
they will agree is unquestionably the first maxim of equity:
Aequitas nullum stercus a nemine non capit. Freely, “Equity de-
mands respect.” (Cicero used “stercus” figuratively as “abuse,”
just the way it’s used here. The real, down-to-earth literal trans-
lation is, “Equity don’t take no fertilizer from nobody.”)

Other pastimes include bridge, chess, bowling, conversation,
reading, listening to music, moderate dining-out and theatre-
going, and extremely little night-clubbing, movie-going and tele-
vision-watching. The good stage shows are unforgettable. Cur-
rent mental re-runs (for inscrutable reasons known only to my
subconscious) include “Oklahoma,” “Visit to a Small Planet” and

[735]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

“Lost in the Stars.” And paired photographs spanning the quarter-
century from youth to maturity call to mind the song asking
where the night went, “so young but a moment ago.”

A decade of reflection has led me to conclude that military
service was, after all, something more than a cure for flat feet.
Its remembered hardships are now an inexhaustible supply of
“Accent” sauce giving savor to almost every moment of almost
every day. We are on the “‘A’ deck” of humanity. Anyone fail-
ing to appreciate that must be pitied. One of our biggest prob-
lems, personally and politically, is striking a proper balance be-
tween the beautification of our staterooms and the protection of
the hull and the steerage passengers.

Finally, a warning to the Class Report Committee: If they reject
this unsolicited manuscript, or take undue editorial liberties,
they'll have a tough time selling me the next edition.

Up until my fortieth year I was a rather carefree bachelor and
traveled far and wide. Just after my forty-first birthday I saw

notable contributions to society were born in 1955 and 1957, two

AFTER graduation I spent a year at Cambridge University,
where, unwittingly, I learned to talk like an Englishman. In the
twenty-four years that have elapsed since that time, most of my
energies have been directed to the remastery of American, my
native tongue. In some of the odd moments left over, ’ve worked
for the American Express Company — travel agents extraordinary.
There it was my pleasure to send people. to Spalato, Ragusa, and
Dubrovnik who had been under the impression that they were
bound for Blackpool or even Bognor Regis. Wearying of the
unappreciative comment of these returning adventurers, I took
off on a flyer of my own — the distribution of educational motion
pictures, with headquarters in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This pleas-
ant whimsy was interrupted by the war. Like many another I
soon found myself in a soldier suit, there to remain for the next
four and one-half years.

Post bellum 1 did graduate work in anthropology at Rutgers
and at the University of Chicago; worked with the Navy Depart-
ment as a bemused efficiency expert; participated in a number of
drillings for oil and gas in West Virginia and Ohio; worked in the
city of Philadelphia’s personnel department as their recruitment
representative; then resigned for the laudable purpose of sailing
to Tahiti. Iwo shipping strikes and a postponed sailing later, I
found myself happily married. They tell me that things are not
what they used to be in Tahiti.

There are a number of nefarious schemes brewing: one, a book
to be called, “How to Make a Living without Actually Work-
ing”; the others to be reported fully on our Fiftieth Anniversary

WITH the “flu” epidemic over, there is time to breathe again.
A pediatrician with a suburban practice enjoys curious periods
of relative inactivity which always turn out to be lulls before
storms. This one could be the eye of a hurricane.

I was a long time in getting here. Prewar there was Harvard
Medical School, and internships and residencies, with a little re-
search thrown in. During the war the Army gave me a captain’s
commission because of my specialty training and promptly ignored
it. So I went to the School of Aviation Medicine and ended up as
a flight surgeon for a Heavy Bombardment Group in England.
It may sound glamorous; it was really quite dull. Postwar I came
back to New York City —to practise pediatrics, teach at Cornell
Medical School, and raise a family. Four and a half years and
two children later I joined the “Drang nach . . .” and moved to
Westchester to practise in White Plains and live in Scarsdale,
transferring my teaching activities to the Albert Einstein College
of Medicine when that school was organized.

My family was also a long time in getting here. Not married

until 1940, we went through three hospitals and five domiciles be-
fore the Army and then, it seemed, countless ones until I went
overseas. Children waited until I came home, then Hank was born
in 47 and Fred in ’49. Both should be good Harvard material
when the time comes.

My most challenging experience, aside from the daily chal-
lenge of the practice of medicine, has been my part in form-

ON graduation I worked for W. R. Grace & Company in New
York and Santiago, Chile. In 1937 I tried my hand at selling
drygoods in New York, I was a lousy salesman in a dismal
business and period. From then on, I had odd jobs, the most
interesting of which was secretary to a retired psychiatrist. In
June, 1940, I enlisted in the Naval Reserve and went on active
duty as an ensign in March, r9q1. After three years in New
York I went to sea as beachmaster, U.S.S. Appling (APA 58).
I got out of the Navy in August, 1945, went back in August,
1950, and was released again in May, 1952. My rank is com-
mander and I am in the Ready Reserve, working with the local
Reserve in Dallas.

I got my law degree from Yale in 1949, with a period of
marine insurance work in Hartford interrupting the uneven
course of events in New Haven. I have never practised law,
and probably never will.

I spent the winter of 1949-50 in Zurich, listening to courses
on commercial law and losing my first wife with the help of
some of the disciples of C. Jung.

In my second tour of naval duty I went to Inchon, Wonsan
and back to Inchon and then, for a year, to Camp McGill out-
side of Yokosuka. My duty was S operations officer, Naval
Beach Group One.

In 1954 I went into teaching, more or less by chance, and I
shall never leave it. I cannot begin to start to commence to say
how exciting I have found this business of working with the
human mind as it grows in society, and out of it. I am teach-
ing boys in grades five to twelve.

My tennis has grown better with the years, and is getting
more workouts here than ever before. I have a standing bet
of twenty-five dollars with my elder son that he cannot beat
me a set, and the money is still waiting, I might call philosophy
my other hobby if I were not so thoroughly convinced that

this study, when it deals with the way in which the human
knows things, especially such things as other human beings,
is the mainspring of my present content.

Having landed in Texas, and in the Congressional district of
the only Republican ever to be sent out of this state to Wash-
ington, I am very quiet politically. If I were called on to take
part, I imagine I would be sort of Rooseveltian Democrat, de-
spising those of my party-fellows who hold up integration and
propagate prejudice of so many different kinds. 1 have firm
religious convictions which, I think, make me an Episcopalian
Agnostic. I don’t go to church.

I hope I will be able to make the Reunion, to find old friends
and new ones who have developed along the same lines as I have.

AN old saying goes somewhat like this: There are three major
events in a person’s life. The first is birth; the second, mar-
riage; the third, death. 1 think another one should be added and
that is going to Harvard.

In our 1948 Report I stated that public education was the
most important issue we had to face and not the A-Bomb. It
still is. The arrival of Sputnik I and II proved it. They have
put the spotlight on our educational system as well as our
military might, While many persons seem to be jabbering as
to what we should do, it is good to see former President Conant
taking up the study of our public secondary schools. In my
opinion, he is doing more for the country than any other person.
The least other Harvard men can do is to lend the weight of
their influence to strengthen all aspects of public education in

their daily contacts. ONE DOFS NOT LET ONE SIDE OF
ONE’S HOUSE RUN DOWN.

months on a new job in a country which is completely strange

[744]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

to me and my family, I find it difficult to pull my thoughts back
from current adventure to review my life since 1933.

I started out as a messenger and clerk for the investment bank-
ing house of R. L. Day & Company in Boston. Fortunately, I was
living with my family in Newton at the time, as my salary (no
doubt commensurate with my value to the firm) was such that,
when the N.R.A. came in with a minimum scale of fifteen dol-
lars a week, the firm had to give me a raise to meet that minimum.

After advancing to the bond department, I decided that high
finance was not my bent. I always had a hankering for news-
paper work (influenced no doubt, by such movie epics of that
era as “The Front Page,” which my classmates will remember).
So I spent my next vacation traveling over much of New Eng-
land in a big, low-slung Buick roadster which I had acquired for
$75 as my first car, visiting newspaper offices in search of a job.

The job I landed, covering principally City Hall, schools and
other civic activities in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, for the Berk-
shire Evening Eagle, developed into an interesting, satisfying ex-
perience which gave me good training and also brought into my
life a gal whom I was to marry. Sally took over the job of social
editor on The Eagle some time after I joined the staff, and lost
her job when she married me.

December seventh is a fateful date in history for me as well
as for the Nation, for I was married on that date in 1940, one
year before Pearl Harbor and I enlisted in the Navy on that date
in 1942, one year after Pearl Harbor. After boot training and
several months of specialized training, I served as radio aircrew-
man in a squadron of PBY patrol flying boats at the Jacksonville,
Florida, Naval Air Station for some sixteen months. Then to
Plattsburg, New York, for two months of officers’ training, fol-
lowed by a course at the Navy Communications School in the
familiar cloisters of the Yard and other hallowed Harvard halls.
I was assigned to the Pacific area and served almost a year on
the U.S.S. Intrepid, an Essex Class aircraft carrier, as a commun-
ications officer with the rank of lieutenant (j.g.). The action we
saw included the Battle of Okinawa, during which a Kamikaze
pancaked on our flight deck and put us out of action. Later, after
the Japanese surrender, we were sent up to the Yellow Sea,

{745 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

where we dodged and scraped through mines while our air-
craft covered troop landings in Korea.

Feeling footloose after my discharge from the Navy, Sally
and I decided to see Mexico, where I planned to try my hand at
newspaper correspondence. We bought an ancient Model A
Ford, installed a rebuilt engine in it, and headed south. Before
going into Mexico, we stopped in Austin, Texas, where I took
some brief courses at the University of Texas Institute of Latin
American Studies. We spent a pleasant three months in Mexico,
traveling about at will and writing pieces on a free-lance basis
for the Christian Science Monitor, New York Times, and other
publications.

When the imminence of parenthood made us think more ser-
iously about things like a steady job and a home, we headed our
trusty Model A north again and settled in Washington, D.C.,
where I joined the staff of the Washington Post as a reporter on
general assignment. It was a job of infinite variety, including
every type of newspaper coverage, from light features on neigh-
borhood doings to covering events of national and international
importance.

During my four years with the Post, we produced in rapid
succession Susan, Ann and Nancy, and just before the latter
arrived, we moved perforce from a small apartment to a house
in the contemporary-styled community of Hollin Hills, near Alex-
andria, Virginia. That was in 1950 and we have lived there since,
until our recent move to Iran. Three years after Nancy came
Wendy to complete our all-girl quartette.

Shortly after we moved to our new house and Nancy was
born, I left the Washington Post to join the Information Staff
of the Economic Cooperation Administration (E.C.A.), which
under Paul Hoffman administered the Marshall Plan. I have con-
tinued in the same type of interesting work in the agencies which
succeeded E.C.A.-M.S.A., headed by Averell Harriman, F.O.A.,
headed by Harold Stassen, and currently I.C.A., the International
Cooperation Administration, whose present director, J. H. Smith,
Jr., recently succeeded John B. Hollister. My work has been to
provide to press and public facts and figures about the U.S.
Mutual Security Program of economic and technical assistance
for nations of the free world. The vital need for this program

[746 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

to strengthen peace and security is one point on which former
President Truman, President Eisenhower and I all agree.

While our most active female quartette has kept Sally and me
pretty busy at home and in the family taxi, I have been mod-
erately active in local civic and community affairs and helped
to organize our Unitarian church. My hobby during the past
few years has been vegetable gardening, which perforce has been
an intensive pursuit, what with the limits of available time and
square footage. Photography, a sometime hobby of mine, has
recently been restricted mostly to the family snapshot variety.
Vacations have been spent principally with our parents or other
relatives in Vermont, the Berkshires and Cape Cod. Last year,
Sally and I broke the pattern by joining my brother, sister and
brother-in-law in a memorable three-week trip to Italy.

A few months ago, an assignment in I.C.A.’s U.S. Operations
Mission to Iran was open, and it seemed like a good idea to take
the family out of the comfortable American rut we were in and
live for a while in completely different surroundings.

So, here we are in a gracious Persian house on the outskirts
of Tehran. It may lack some of the conveniences (and ap-
pliances) to which we are accustomed, but we have a good-sized
garden, swimming pool and even a greenhouse, and above all,
a magnificent view of the snow-capped Alborz mountain range.
Already, the place and the people are growing on us. Judging
from those we have met, the Iranians appear to be individualistic
but courteous, independent but friendly, at times explosive but
usually cheerful, sometimes baffling or even exasperating to West-
erners, but certainly interesting.

In short, we are looking forward to the rest of our two-year
tour here, which seems to be going fast already. Our only regret
is the prospect of missing the one and only Twenty-fifth!

HAVING completed my course requirements in the middle
of my senior year, I plunged into matrimony in March of 1933,
on the same day that Franklin D. Roosevelt became president

[748 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

for the first of too-many-times, and later that spring, upon
completion of my oral exams, my spouse and I moved to an
apartment in New York where I joined my family brokerage
firm as a partner and member of the New York Stock Exchange.
For the next four years, I lived in New York, and my mar-
riage was blessed by the birth of my son, Bob—of whom
more later.

In 1937 I returned to my real home near Philadelphia and
became co-senior partner of my firm. The following year,
1938, we had a daughter, Alix — whose present activities I shall
also touch upon later. Having been interested in politics liter-
ally since childhood, I plunged actively into the Republican
organization in my home county and, in due course, became
chairman of the County Young Republican group. By 1952,
this Republican organization saw fit to dispatch me to Chicago
to help nominate Eisenhower; and again, in 1956, I was sent to
San Francisco as an alternate delegate.

My charitable interests center mostly in hospital work, and
by 1940, I headed up the board of trustees of Episcopal Hos-
pital — fifth largest voluntary general hospital in this area. Since
_ that time, I have remained active on this board of trustees and
have held pretty nearly every job possible from secretary to
president. In 1953 I was elected a trustee of Temple Univer-
sity, and have greatly enjoyed taking a small share in the activi-
ties of this extremely interesting and dynamic university.
Perhaps, in due course, I may earn some kind of fancy honorary
degree which will entitle me to wear a somewhat more resplen-
dent cape at graduation exercises than the plain crimson one
that Harvard gave me! I have always felt that the colors worn
by one who has been awarded a degree of Doctor of Pedagogy
are most resplendent, and I definitely yearn after such an article
of clothing!

Soon after the outbreak of World War II, I enlisted in the
Navy and was commissioned lieutenant (j.g.). For the first
two years I served as officer-in-charge of Merchant Marine
Reserve Procurement for the Fourth Naval District. This job
was interesting at first but, by 1944, I considered it about
cleaned up, so I applied for sea duty and was assigned as senior

[ 749 ]

HARVARD CLASS .OF 1933

watch officer on a Navy transport. Our home port was San

Francisco and we spent the balance of the war in the central
and western Pacific and the Indian Ocean area. The duty was
actually tops, and I really greatly enjoyed it in most ways,
After the war ended, I was placed on inactive duty with the
permanent rank of lieutenant commander and eventually went
on the retired list in 1953.

My first marriage went on the rocks in the 1940’s and termi-
nated in divorce in 1948. I then married a marvelous girl, Sonya
Paris, also of Philadelphia, and we now live on our farm out-
side of Philadelphia and a happy life ir is indeed for me.

My hobby is collecting military pistols and rifles. I work
daily in my brokerage office in Philadelphia and keep up my
interest in politics, civic affairs and hospitals. Sonya and I both
love to travel, and have made quite a few extensive trips during
the last ten years, including the Caribbean area, most of Europe,
and most of Africa. We especially love this latter Continent,
and plan to return there, if possible, in 1959. We also plan a
trip through Central and South America, |

My son, Bob, will graduate from Harvard in June, 1958. He
is engaged to a perfectly wonderful girl, Virginia Patterson,
who will also graduate in 1958 from Radcliffe College. They
plan to get married at the end of November, 1957, so I can look
forward hopefully to having a nice daughter-in-law by the
time this article goes to press!

‘My daughter, Alix, is attending Smith College, Class of 1960,
where she is doing very well in every way, and we are very
proud of her, too.

The past twenty-five years have been very full ones for me
in every way, some unhappiness, of course, but most of the
years have been good ones, and I certainly have no complaints:
life has been very good to me. There are not too many mem-
bers of our class in the Philadelphia area, but we see each other
from time to time and that is always most pleasant. I shall
look forward to our Reunion with anticipation.

I COULD start off with a classic remark of my wife — “If any-
one had told you years ago that you would be designing ladies’
jewelry .

But back i in 1933 and with Harvard behind me, I tried a little
of the National Shawmut Bank, the General Electric Supply
Corporation, some radio announcing and along with these wrote a
column in the Lowell Sunday Telegram for a couple of years.
Finally, as is the case with many Lowellites, I emerged in textiles.
After a few years, starting in Connecticut and winding up in
St. Hyacinthe, Canada, came December 7, 1941, and I came
back to the States to enlist in the Navy. My tour of duty took
me to New York, to Southern England during the invasion,
thence to London and finally to Bremen and Bremerhaven,
Germany. Just about the most interesting of my work in the
Navy was that of French and German interpreter which resulted
in many interesting assignments.

Out in 1946, I found myself perchance directed to the field
of jewelry in which for eight and one-half years I traveled in
the midwest and far west selling for one of the oldest and finest
jewelry manufacturers in the country. As an aside, it was amazing
the number of classmates I ran into and there were regular visits
with Sam Morgan and his fine family in St. Paul, Minnesota.
(Sam’s my former roommate, you know.) But with the advent
of a spouse and a daughter, both of which I missed much too
much on the weeks away, I decided to go into manufacturing
and let others try and sell my ideas. In the past three years or

[751]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

more, I am glad to say that our impact has been felt in the retail
market. I would not trade this field for any others, though the
thought of being thus connected could not have once been further
from my mind.

Being in Attleboro, we have rather adopted South Chatham
on the Cape as our vacation spot where we have watched our
Sally develop from a foot splasher to some semblance of a
swimmer. We look forward to a new swim club opening in
Attleboro which should allay some of the blistering hot days
when not on vacation. We live within a stone’s throw of a golf
course — but just let’s be ashamed of the few times we have
used it.

We are rather proud of being a small part of the building and
dedication of our new $250,000 Murray Universalist Church. It
is very modern in design but very functional. Interesting to note
that “they came to scoff and remained to pray” and in the past
month despite inclement weather the growth has been wonder-
ful to observe. \

So, having alluded to family, business, religion and war service,
I have thrown a very thin blanket over the Jast twenty-five years
and can only add that we look forward to June, 1958, and that
long heralded Reunion.

[753 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

Keeping abreast of the law, attending and then leading a
Hutchins-Adler Great Books Discussion Group for several
years, and trying to answer searching questions from my Har-
vard son on such books as Colin Wilson’s The Outsider, have
helped to prevent intellectual atrophy.

Family life has been the center of much of my activity as
I suspect it has for many of our Class. Perhaps those of us
who graduated in the depths of the Depression have by design
or necessity had the fun of being with our offspring more than
many of our parents and predecessors. Wars, taxes and infla-
tion seem to have made us center our lives on our families,
even to some degree at the expense of the puruit of “honors”
or even of the “ever-shrinking dollar.” Thus for myself as well
as for my classmate, Ben Sommers, ’33, family life has to a large
degree centered at “Aushegun,” a communal Brook Farm-type
community on a beautiful clear lake in Wisconsin, some forty-
five minutes’ drive from St. Paul, where a most successful tenth
summer has just been completed for all of the half dozen families
in the colony with their total of twenty children.

Recent family travels have included a trip to the Rockies in
1956 and in 1957 a delightful canoe trip with my two capable
sons in the border lakes wilderness area of northern Minnesota
and Ontario. Occasional trips East, mostly on business, have
helped me keep in all too infrequent touch with a few of my
classmates,

During the last two and a fraction years a Harvard son has
furnished me a splendid opportunity to relive undergraduate
days even to the extent of attending a few classes and finding
that Harvard is in truth a far more mature, stimulating and
demanding place than it was a quarter century ago,

ber of timber products. Being associated with a small, family-
owned company has many pleasant advantages, also its hardships.
I think I have known them all. The company has had fair success
and growth and I can’t find much cause for complaint in respect
to my work. Or, in any other respect, for that matter.

In addition to my job, my interests, in which Patty joins me,
are quite simple: my family, golf (very erratic), a limited amount
of travel and reading. Other interests, such as bridge, seem to
have been discarded and I firmly resist many new, or outgrown,
activities suggested by the kids.

I get much pleasure and satisfaction from my church (Episco-
pal), greatly enjoy living in a small town and having the com-
pany of several long-time friends. I have no feeling for politics
except to be annoyed at the excess of it and suppose, in my
voting, I would be classified an Independent. I would like to see
any of my Harvard friends whenever they are nearby.

of the University Club of New York and entered the employ
of B. T. Batsford, Ltd, a British firm of booksellers and pub-
lishers then opening a New York branch. I was with them for
two years, six months of the time in London filling orders for
the New York shop. On this side I was in charge of the second-
hand department. By June of 1949, when I came back from
England, the American branch had begun to fail, and on Novem-
ber first I found myself out of work.

My next job, after several months of unemployment and a
rather desperate little holiday in Paris and Vienna, was that of
librarian of the Cooper Union Museum. Its library of about
15,000 volumes was mostly on the applied arts: furniture, tex-
tiles, wallpaper, ceramics, metal work, lace, etc. It included
as well a collection of old and rare books, principally architecture,
ornament and color plate publications. Here again, as in Batsford’s
second-hand department, there was a copy of the elephant
folio of Audubon’s Birds of America; and 1 think it is through
frequent workouts with these massive and costly volumes that
I have succeeded in preserving physical fitness.

I left Cooper Union at the end of March, 1955, on account
of a five-year clause in their retirement fund policy (I wanted
cash rather than an annuity) and on the proceeds spent the
latter half of April and all of May in Jugoslavia, which pleased
me very much, especially Bosnia and Macedonia, the wilder
and more Turkish parts of the country.

Two weeks after landing in New York I became librarian of
the National Recreation Association, an organization previously
unknown to me, though founded in 1906 by Joseph Lee, 83.
It possessed some 5,000 volumes on the vague, all-embracing
theme of recreation and received several hundred such periodi-
cals as Pen Friend, Scholastic Coach, Chronic Illness News Letter
and The Floor Plant Journal. In addition to being librarian I
was keeper of the Information Files, a collection of no less than
185 fireproof steel drawers of picnic manuals, leadership aids,
safety rules, evaluation schedules, in-service training plans,
Mother’s Day programs for the handicapped, etc.

After spending nearly two fun-focused years in this ‘‘national
reservoir of accumulated experience and thinking,” it was with

[756]

considerable relief that I resigned to take up my present duties.
The New York School of Social Work, formerly a part of the
Russell Sage Foundation, became a graduate school of Columbia
University in 1940, and in 1949 moved into the Carnegie man-
sion, a somewhat oppressive but comfortable building.

Since college I have taken courses in Italian, Russian and
Spanish, and at present I am having Arabic lessons. In addition
to the modern paintings, primitive sculpture and carte-de-visite
photographs of Victorian circus freaks mentioned in our 1948
Anniversary Report, I now collect reliquaries and ex-votos.

THE time has come,” the Walrus said, “to speak of many
things.” And how right you are, Mr. Walrus! Tabulating
twenty-five years of any man’s life would be tedious and unre-
warding; listing his dreams versus his accomplishments, his
deeds versus his efforts, are statistics more befitting an obituary.

My own reaction to this call for a report is that it’s time for
an evaluation, a re-evaluation and a program for the next twenty-
five just ahead of us. The big advantage of these bifocals I’m
wearing is the opportunity of looking at the near and looking
at the distant almost simultaneously. The same eyes and the
same lenses, but entirely different views.

Have I been happy? Emphatically, Yes. Have I achieved the
material goals I set in 1933? Definitely not. Would I live my
life differently if I had the chance to run the course again?
No, Sir. Have I accomplished anything of value to mark my
existence in the community? I sincerely believe so, Do I know
where I’m heading and why? I think so. Plus factors for the
past are solid: twenty years of marriage to a wonderful woman,
a couple of strapping sons of whom I’m enormously proud; a
broadly varied experience in business; a regular contribution
of time and effort to community affairs.

My boys are well on the way to manhood, one son at Frank-
lin and Marshall and the other a senior at high school; my wife
moving beside me into the wonderful middle years. And, after
years of searching for a niche to fit me, I’ve found it. I am
presently engaged as president and sales manager of Bolton
Farm Packing Company, a unique operation designing and
packaging food rations for civilian exploration personnel. Plenty
of room for individual thinking and effort; sales at top level;
room for growth, and a constant challenge.

The future? I’m full to bursting with plans. Watch for the
next issue.

THERE will no doubt be many who can write of exciting
experiences of spectacular achievements since the last Report,
but I am certainly not one of them. My guess is | am not the
only one who approaches this assignment with a bit of a shock
to realize I have been in the same job, living in the same com-
munity, with no increase in family since last reporting, and
very happy about it all.

After the war I wanted to return to manufacturing but to
use my previous factory and Naval experience in a small com-
pany where I could have a greater share in the management.
With the Comtor Company since 1946, I have shared in the
control with my brother. Our business in precision gaging
instruments has shown gratifying gains under our care,

At home in Cambridge we never seem to have much time
on our hands. Nancy, as head of the Lower School at Bucking-
ham, has been successfully meeting the challenge of continual
need for expansion. The enrollment has more than doubled in
the years she has been on the job. The rest of the family often
has to pitch in to keep the home fires burning. The children
have benefited immeasureably from living in an atmosphere of
happy activity in which we try to give help where really
needed, but no pampering.

Nancy, Jr., approaching sixteen, has all the attributes. She con-
tends that Neil gets everything he wants, but what older sister
doesn’t. Neil, ten this winter, is going his own serene way and I
have a feeling he'll get there no matter what anyone thinks.

Aside from the sport of home maintenance well known to most

of us, I have kept health and happiness in skiing, sculling on the
Charles, surf-fishing on the Cape back-shore, woodworking, and
model railroading. As to work in the public interest 1 am an
enthusiastic supporter of the CCA for better government in
Cambridge and the principle of the annual United Fund Drive. I
have always been glad to do work for either of them.

_ THE pursuit of architecture has been the focus of my endeavors
since 1933, with the exception of four years off in the Navy
(Air Combat Intelligence). I say pursuit advisedly, for I fin-
ished four years of architectural school at Harvard and the
following year in Europe on a traveling fellowship simultane-
ously with the real onset of the architectural revolution now
known popularly as “modern.” Today the challenge of con-
stant change in planning, construction and costs to meet old
as well as new functions and sociological progress in general

[ 760 |

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

requires the process of continuous learning. It is pretty long
and hard work at times,

My one and only employer since school has been the firm
that designed so much building at Harvard in our day. It is a
progressive outfit and turns out a quality product. The ma-
jority of my own effort has been on hospital and school projects.
A hospital in particular is a most complex building type at best,
and it has been changing in the past twenty years just as fast
as medicine has progressed. I have found it satisfying to con-
template that our buildings may have made a direct contribution
toward the alleviation of human suffering and the prolonging
of our life expectancy, and also that our schools may be help-
ing to produce better citizens. I have come to prefer this type
of institutional work to the strictly commercial line, perhaps
largely because the trustees, staffs, teachers and others asso-
ciated on the projects are such a grand group to work with.
Among the specific rewards has been the privilege during the
past few years to serve on two nation-wide committees, one the
Committee on Safety in Hospital Operating Rooms of the Na-
tional Fire Protection Association, the other the Committee on
Hospitals and Health of the American Institute of Architects.

I have also enjoyed, or should say succumbed to, a parallel
preoccupation with extra-curricular responsibilities. A number
of charity and civic interests have constantly held a fair amount
of my attention, On top of these are the inevitable obligations
to serve a variety of professional organizations and social clubs,
either as an officer or on the endless belt of committee structure.

No wonder most of the days don’t seem long enough! Some-
times I wonder if [ take it all too seriously. I do draw the line,
and therefore there is nothing out of the ordinary to say about
my religious and political convictions. There is still time for
Sis and two wonderful children and sailing any time at the hint
of a chance to go.

If I had it to do again it would undoubtedly be more of
the same.

LACK of funds prevented my return to Harvard. I spent the
depression years doing odd jobs and working my way around
the U.S. I worked in Florida hotels and on western stock farms.
In 1936 I returned home and signed up for a course in account-
ing. Soon afterwards, I landed a job with a small concern that
had the original patent on the fin-tube radiator. I stayed with
the company for eighteen years and worked up to the position
of comptroller. A shift in management left me out in the cold
IN 1954.

Rather than move in order to maintain my income, I took
an accounting job at the University of Connecticut, For-
tunately, I had acquired a little home in the country with a few
acres of land, a few head of beef cattle, tractor and other
suitable gadgets for rural life. 1 am now living the simple life,
driving to work over a country road with no traffic, home
before dark and with time to throw the football to my sons.

In fact, aside from my part-time farming, my spare time is
spent carting my older son to church meetings, 4-H Club work
or school activities. It isn’t a bad life, but when I read about
heavy consumer spending, I feel like the man from Mars.

Society, in general, has undergone such a change in the last
twenty years that I am unable to recognize any part of it. I
think it has deteriorated. However, there should be consider-
able improvement about 150 years from now. Meanwhile, I
intend to sit it out. There are enough interesting things in the

[ 762 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

general mess so that a man who picks out those which appeal
to him and lets the rest go by the board can lead a pretty good
life.

As to politics, I am a Republican most of the time because
they seem to be the lesser of two evils. I voted against Eisen-
hower and have no regrets. I think Dulles is a national and inter-
national calamity. It looks as though the whole country will
shortly be off on another tangent. Every child will be taught
to be a scientist; books, magazines, television and radio will be

lastered with articles about rockets; and our homes, cars and
skillets will probably be designed to look like guided missiles.
As for religion, my older son and I faithfully attend St. Peter's
Episcopal Church in Hebron. At this time of my life religion
seems to reach me with more force than previously, and it’s a
wonderful thing for my son, due to the presence of an energetic
young priest who has a way with children.

HAVING spent the past twenty-five years gathering little, if
any, moss, I find the prospect of recapitulating more than a little
frightening. However, here are the lowlights:

After graduation I entered the family business in New York,
and in due course became married and a suburbanite. Prior to

[763] *

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

the outbreak of the war, my wife and I made a couple of trips
to the west coast which served to convince me that I was def-
initely a displaced person, but the opportunities to escape from
the East appearing to be limited, I contented myself with an
occasional wistful glance toward the setting sun.

Came the war, and the revelation that Uncle Sam wanted ME,
so I embarked on a new career. Having found me to possess
the necessary qualifications, a strong back and a weak mind, the
Army deposited me in the Infantry, and I went through basic
training in Kentucky. A very rugged but most rewarding ex-
perience. From there I went to Artillery OCS, and then to France
and Germany with the rooth Division, where I came to the con-
clusion that being in the Army was a helluva way to make a
living.

The one really valuable result of my experience in the service
was an opportunity to break with the East, so immediately upon
getting my discharge I moved to the coast and, in an attempt
to keep as far from office work as possible, bought a small dairy
and berry farm somewhere between Seattle and Tacoma. For a
few years we led a rough but pleasant existence, but finally my
wife decided that I was really cut out to be a bachelor, so she
proceeded to implement this idea via the courts,

Finding that farming in a state of single blessedness was an
impossibility, my next venture was to prove that the teaching of
mathematics was being done improperly, and that there was really
no need to produce so much antagonism to the subject on the
part of the students. In order to get the necessary certificates,
I spent a year at the University of Washington getting a Bach-
elor’s degree in math, and then two more years to pick up my
Master’s. But by the time I had garnered my new diplomas, the
Korean incident was in full swing, as a result of which the enroll-
ment in all schools on the coast had diminished to the point at
which new teachers were not at all in demand — not even those
with breathtakingly new ideas about the teaching of mathematics.
But J learned of an opening in research in San Francisco, so, with
a reluctant farewell to Seattle I took up my abode in the Bay
area, And from this, the most wonderful spot in the world,
nothing will ever move me.

For the past six years things have been about as close to the

- [764]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

ideal as they could be, The Bay area leaves almost nothing to
be desired. And the job I embarked on proved to be completely
fascinating. Our task at the lab is to try to determine what
happens — aside from a big bang — when a nuclear weapon goes
off, and what can be done about it. As may be surmised, this is
a field in which relatively little is known, and consequently there
is a good deal of the pioneering thrill to working on the prob-
lems which confront us. During the past three years I have had
the specific assignment of selecting and arranging for the instal-
lation of an electronic computer, setting up traiming a staff to
man the monster, selecting problems for solution on it, and so
on. It has been a busy time.

A couple of years ago, on a trip back (ugh) east, I met the
lovely Mrs. Robert Peters and her two wonderful children. We
all got married and lived happily ever after. We found a delight-
ful home at just the right distance from San Francisco to make
commuting a pleasure, and are avidly engaged in gardening,
Cub Scouting, PTA, and so on. Week-ends we do some sailing
on San Francisco Bay, which is an exciting and unpredictable
body of water. It makes sailing on Long Island Sound or Puget
Sound look like kids’ stuff. Never a dull moment. It takes a
while to become accustomed to being wet part of the time and
cold most of the time, but if you’re looking for thrills, this is
the place.

So I guess I must admit that the first twenty-five years have
been not only varied, but exciting and a lot of fun. Hope the
next twenty-five can equal them.

IT is said that history must be viewed from a distance, to get
perspective. Without glorifying this small squib as history,
nevertheless a look backward seems to show a simple basic out-
line. For example: these years have been divided precisely half
and half between a bachelor life (the first half) and marriage.
These years have seen several changes of jobs. 1 have not moved
far afield, geographically, but moves have been fairly frequent.
Perhaps half of these years (again the first half!) found me
little changed in girth and general appearance, and the other
half has shown an advancing waistline and less need to visit
the barber shop. Here and there a line of cause and effect is
evident. The moves have followed jobs, or Navy orders. Get-
ting married was the happy outcome of one of the moves.
And perhaps my changing girth has evolved from the content-
ment of married life.

My first two years after graduation were spent at nearly
opposite poles —the first at the Berkshire School (where I pre-
pared for college), handling Alumni Association affairs, and
the second in Filene’s Basement, carrying the merchandise
hither and yon. Then, in 1935, I made up my mind to a career
in accounting and went to work in Boston for Lybrand, Ross
Bros. & Montgomery, one of the outstanding firms of public
accountants. I continued with this office for seven years, and
during this period obtained the degree of Certified Public
Accountant,

In 1942 I entered Navy service with a Reserve commission.
In view of my accounting background, the Bureau put me
in a job of cost inspection, which meant the review and
approval of costs on Navy contracts. My duties never took me
out of the country, but they meant new and interesting prob-

[ 766 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

lems, encountered in new places. Much as I despise the useless
tragedy of war, I must personally admit to a thoroughly inter-
esting four years. Among other things the service included an
assignment to Jamestown, New York (where an experimental
aircraft was being made). This led to meeting Jenny, and we
were married in the fall of 1945. In 1946 we took a tour of the
country, coast to coast, for about six weeks. Then the variety
of the war years and the leisure of vacation were put behind
and I settled down to a civilian job.

Since the war I have worked at my. trade as an accountant
for three employers, seeking some greener pasture with each
move. Five years were spent with New England Confectionery
Company in Cambridge, the next two in Wilmington with
duPont. Since that time I have been with S. D. Warren Com-
pany, paper manufacturers, and came to Muskegon in 1953,
upon the company’s acquisition of a manufacturing plant here.

Our day-to-day activities undoubtedly have a familiar ring.
Jim and Becky are eleven and nine and occupy much of our
time. We take a moderate part in community affairs, United
Fund, P.T.A. and such. I have very full hours at my job, and
we seem to have a festive community of friends, so that there
are not many vacant moments. As to hobbies, in the earlier
years I played a lot of tennis and squash, but have now given
these up. In their place, I am now busy (though mediocre) on
the golf course. I have always enjoyed contract bridge and
still play a lot, I like to read, and have a vain hope that this
may some day improve my mind. I believe that a knowledge
of the past, and of men’s accomplishments and beliefs, is indis-
pensable to a solution of the future.

The future: in an earlier report I made some statement as
to being an eternal optimist on world progress. I still say this,
but the words now have new meaning in view of the capacity
for destruction developed in recent years. It seems self-evident
that any hope for human progress must be based on the assump-
tion that the new-found powers will be used for constructive
good, rather than for destruction. I do assume this, and so con-
tinue an eternal optimist.

A writing of this kind should be undertaken in peace and in

[ 767 ]

solitude, with time for reflection, and an opportunity to organ-
ize the backward trails of memory. Peace and solitude I do
not have, if measured by the level of activity m the household.
However, peace I do have, if defined in terms of state of mind,

or happiness.

I REALIZE how easy it is for those who survive us to com-
press our whole lifetime into one short epitaph. I have been
examining twenty-five years of my own lifetime and even from
a violently partisan point of view can find material enough for
only a short résumé. Mainly, I have worked, raised a family,
accepted the civic responsibilities and survived the social func-
tions of a small town. As were many of my neighbors, I was
involved in World War II for three years, serving in the Leyte
and Luzon campaigns as an artillery officer and in the first
stages of the occupation of Japan.

In a brief, adventurous period, I edited and published a small
verse magazine. That was my only sin against normalcy. Since
it brought me neither fame nor fortune, I have repented, As
a final proof of my normalcy, I am twenty-five pounds heavier
than when I left Harvard, but it is my wife who goes on the

diets.

WHEN one is a child, one is obliged to accept the ideas which
are presented to one, in the same way that one accepts for better
or for worse the food which is offered one; a Tuareg child
grows up to think and reason like a Tuareg; a Tibetan child
grows up to think like a Tibetan (this was true at any rate before
the Communists imposed their control on the country), and a
child who is born and brought up in modern European civiliza-
tion inevitably comes to think like a modern European; his out-
look is moulded for him willy-nilly; the ideas which condition
his behavior and outlook are those which are considered “neces-
sary” and “proper” by those who have charge of his education.
Doubtless there are many tendencies in modern European and
American thought and life, and here environment and social
condition play a certain role, but the dominant ideas of modern
European and American civilization are the same whether one
lives in London, in Pittsburgh, or in Moscow, and whatever one’s
circumstances.

This being so, it remains to ask ourselves what is the function

[770]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

and purpose of education, and why one kind of education is
better than another. Most people will reply that the function
of education is to allow us to adapt ourselves to our environ-
ment, man being regarded as a kind of animal whose primary
function in life is to adapt himself to a constantly-changing and
more or less hostile environment, but those who adopt this con-
ception overlook the fact that this environment, not the natural
environment of course but the man-made environment or civil-
ization in which we find ourselves, that is to say, modern civil-
ization, is itself a product of man’s thinking and not the result
of an “evolution” independent of man’s will, and this thinking
which has shaped modern civilization is, as I have already re-
marked, not the thinking of mankind as a whole but is peculiar
to — or was until very recently — that particular branch of the
white race which lives in Europe or its colonies (for the Hindus,
Persians, Turks and Arabs also belong to the white race) and
is moreover of very recent origin. Modern machine civilization
is in fact a product of that rationalistic and materialistic kind
of thinking which first appeared in Europe at the end of the
fifteenth century and which had as its points of departure the
rationalism of Descartes who wished to reduce everything in
civilization to purely human proportions. The Christian civil-
ization of the Middle Ages, on the other hand, and the civilization
of the Orient and of the ancient world — except for the Graeco-
Roman decadence which had much in common with the modern
world and of which the modern world is a sort of continuation
—are the product of another kind of thinking which we may
define as traditional, the basic and determining element in this
thinking being a traditional doctrine which can be either meta-
physical, as in the case of the Hindu, Mahayana, Buddhist and
Chinese cvilizations, or partly metaphysical and partly religious,
as in the case of the Islamic and Christian civilizations, but which
is in any case of divine or superhuman origin. Education is thus
essentially a question of the indoctrination of ideas and the mould-
ing of an outlook, whether in modern or traditional civilization,
and only in limited and quite secondary sense a means of adapta-
tion to a particular environment.

The purpose of education is quite different, moreover, in
modern civilization from what it is in traditional civilization. Tra-

[771 J

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

least of which would be to persuade a qualified person to give
such a course, for, though one or several such persons might be
found, it is not sure that any of them would consider it worth
their while to undertake such a task. I have felt obliged, never-
theless, to discuss the possibility because the question of education
is discussed very widely nowadays, generally without any real
understanding of the problem, and it is worthwhile perhaps to
oint out where the trouble lies and what positive step could be
taken if Harvard or some other university were disposed to do
SO.
As a graduate of Harvard, I am continually asked to give
money to support an educational program which, from the point
of view at which I place myself, is essentially destructive not
only of the spiritual values of life, but also of human personality,
meaning by human personality those basic tendencies and he-
reditary dispositions in human nature which determine the par-
ticular character and aptitudes of an individual. It is these basic
differences in human nature which are taken account of and
respected in traditional civilization, and which are brushed aside
and violated in modern materialistic civilizaton. Needless to say,
I have not felt any obligation to aid this kind of education to
which I am unalterably opposed, nor could I give very much
if I wished to, for the salary of a teacher of English in a Swiss-
private school, though it is enough for a bachelor to live on
in Switzerland, would certainly seem small by American stand-
ards. I am willing, however, to contribute to support the Har-
vard program if and when a course on the basic principles of
traditional thought and civilization is given at Harvard by a
qualified person, that is to say, someone who belongs to one of
the Eastern traditions, whether he be a European or Asiatic by
birth, and who really understands these principles.

This, then, is the report I have to offer concerning the twenty-
five years which have elapsed since I left Harvard. My first
inclination was to say nothing, for as Black Elk, a holy man of
the Ogalala Sioux, has said:

What is one man that he should make much of his
winters, even when they bend him like a heavy snow?
So many other men have lived and shall live that story,
to be grass upon the hills.

[ 782 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

But on second thought I realized that my silence would be
misinterpreted and I have, therefore, made an effort to explain
why a Harvard education has not left me with a deeper sense
of gratitude and what for me would be the minimum conditions
for taking an interest in Harvard as an educational institution.
It is evident that the majority, if not all, of my classmates will
disagree with this way of looking at things; they are content
with the materialistic conception of man and civilization which
underlies and determines the nature and methods of modern
education and consider any criticism of this conception or these
methods from a traditional point of view simply as an attempt
to put the clock back; the truth of the ideas involved does not
interest them because they are not interested in truth as such
but merely what suits their material interests. I do not address
myself to them, therefore, with the idea of convincing them
of the truth of what I say, but simply to explain how and why
our paths have diverged. For me there is no question of putting
the clock back but of living here and now according to the
truth which is enunciated in traditional doctrines and which is
certainly not abolished by the existence of modern materialistic
civilization, being independent of time and space, “the same now
as it ever was and the same to be for. evermore” (St. Augustine).
If this point of view be unacceptable to my contemporaries, so
much the worse for them.

What carest thou up here how they whisper?
Come after me and let them speak their mind,
Stand like a tower stout and unwavering
Against whatever buffets of the wind.

HERE in Denver, “The Mile-Hi City,” it would seem that the
rarefied atmosphere would be conducive to a flow of pertinent
prose resulting in a torrent of terrific discourse for this “ac-
count.” Unfortunately, I have not found it so. But, anything
to get out of the back water and here goes.

Was able to weather the Depression, Drouth and Dustbowl
of the Thirties-in the heartland of Nebraska at Broken Bow.
Managed the Commercial Law Section of my father’s law office
with excursions into organizational Republican politics, and work-
ing for a public utilities company. Studied law under leading
Central Nebraska lawyers and took some correspondence.courses.
The end result was passing the Nebraska State Bar examinations
with a respectable score in 1937 and admission to practice in
State and Federal Courts. Did so with a general practice. Did
not like the look of the international situation. Recalled the advice
of Grandpappy Myers who had fought through four years of
Civil War on the Union side, which was: “Son, if it ever looks like
a war may come and maybe you in it, you had better learn
something about that trade.” So, when a National Guard Com-
pany was organized in my home town, in 1938, I enlisted as a
private.

The company was ordered to active service in December,
1940, and with the 35th Division was stationed at Camp Joseph
T. Robinson, Little Rock, Arkansas. There, the finest thing that
happened to me was that I became acquainted with the widow
of Major Eugene Neville and her adorable daughter. We were
married and I had my fine family which has now been augmented
by a stalwart son-in-law and two delightful grandchildren.

[ 784 }

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

From Camp Robinson it was overseas to the Southwest Pacific
where we followed General MacArthur and vice-versa for almost
three years. Back to the States and release to inactive service in
1946. Last rank — major.

Resumed the general practice of law in Nebraska, with em-
phasis upon trial work both civil annd criminal and must have
become fairly proficient. In fact, a veteran District Court re-
porter once told me that I reminded him more of William Jen-
nings Bryan than any other attorney he had ever heard. I
thanked him and told him that I hoped that any resemblance
was centered solely at the larynx and not above it. Also opened
an office in North Dakota to see if the colder climate would al-
leviate recurrent imalaria. Finally, wore the malaria out and
remained in Nebraska until coming to Denver for health reasons
where my work has been mainly that of credit manager. We
both love Denver, the climate, people and recreational oppor-
tunities. I may apply for admission to the Colorado Bar on a
reciprocal basis. All of this is certainly anything but sensational,
but life-to-date has been filled with many, many worthwhile
moments.

“Though a Republican and on a first name calling basis with
some of our nation’s leading Republicans, I am profoundly dis-
pleased with recent national and international developments. I
followed Grandpappy’s advice once, but I'll be golly darned if
at my ripe age, I want to start in learning about ICBMs, IMBMs,
Mach Plus Planes and all of the other accouterments of the trade
of modern war. But, we shall see what we shall see and, Best

Regards.

FIVE years of practice of law in New York City, in which

the gloom of the depression was brightened by association with

George Gordon Battle, the best lawyer and greatest human

being I have ever known, were interrupted by Pearl Harbor.

In four often stimulating but sometimes boring years of the

Army on the Pentagon I never ceased to be amazed that we

were able to win the war despite incredible ignorance, mistakes,

and waste. The experts say that the enemy was twice as bad -
in these departments, but no doubt our material advantage

tipped the scales, As I write this, the radio reports Sputnik II

in the sky, one small evidence that our material advantage

appears to be fading or has faded. On the national scene, too,
we seem to be bankrupt of men. Power seems to dominate our
world, but perhaps the answer to some of our problems may
be found in the greatest power of all—the power of thought,
and in this, as in the past, we look to Harvard to play a large

role. ,

After the war, having added a family and not being able to
start all over and subsist on nuts and berries, I did not return
to the private practice of law, but became counsel to the
Welch Grape Juice Company, where I verified the adage In
Vino Veritas. After that company was sold to the farmers’
cooperative [ came to my present employer.

These twenty-five years have been a period of acquisition.
On the credit side are a fine family which I get to know better
each summer and which become more interesting daily; good
friends; a modern house which we built two years ago with
that rarest of beings, an expert and honest builder, and with-
out a single headache; paintings (Courbet, Balthus, and the
world’s largest collection of Alice Neamans); a sailboat, which
repays the hard work of April and May with June to October
fun and relaxation; a few assets attributable more to ten years
of unprecedented prosperity and inflation than to intelligence

or foresight; and a little knowledge and experience. On the
debit side are the usual mortgage and obligations, about twenty-
five extra pounds; and the gnawing discontent at not having
time to do many of the things I should like to do, including
reading most of the books I can’t stop buying.

As an antidote to the aridity and materialism of Westchester,
I have worked on a committee of Sarah Lawrence College to
bring chamber music and modest Broadway shows to the stu-
dents and community. Some day we hope to make a contribu-
tion to the American stage through experimental work in sum-
mer theatre.

In summation, thank the Lord I have lived through these
twenty-five years and have done so little harm. Perhaps for
the next report I shall be able to record having done some good.

IT is with great misgivings that I embark on this account. Since
English A I have not written more than is necessary about any-
thing, and at this stage I do not propose to change my habits.
My tax returns have just been examined with minute derail.
I continue to be befuddled by it all, and as to why one has
to pay so much, It follows of necessity that one can save so

little.
Following graduation I entered Harvard Medical School.

[ 787 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

The reasons for permitting my admission are somewhat mys-
terious. Four. years later I emerged an M.D., traveled for a few
months, and then received graduate training at the Boston
Children’s Hospital, Peter Bent Brigham Hospital and the Pres-
byterian Hospital in New York. During the previously men-
tioned travels, in Japan I found a wandering Australian girl,
Margot Ardlie, and summoned enough courage to be married.
As customary, we had children, two to be exact — Sandra, now
eighteen, and Susan, fifteen. Sandra is a freshman at the Univer-
sity of California and Susan is ensconced at Sarah 'Dix Hamlin
School in San Francisco. My wife plays golf, keeps a busy
house going, and still speaks Australian,

The U.S. Government, without so much as a how-do-you-do,
engaged my services in the Army for five years, and I accom-
plished the menial chores assigned me with as much grace as
I could muster. I then wanted to see the wide open spaces and
followed the dictum, “Go West, young man” (of course, I was
pretty old by then) and went to Fresno, California. Ortho-
pedic surgery being my field I have naturally limited myself to
that work. It is a field of many pitfalls, and I think I have
experienced them all. I still persevere and have no intention
of giving up now.

Since my initial trip around the world I have restricted my
travels to the western states. My hobbies are boating, golf,
hunting, and fishing. I have a ponderous boat of no great
worth; however, it requires a great deal of tinkering. I’m prob-
nel a Republican, but vote occasionally for a good Democrat.

I'm hoping to live to be eighty.

AS there were very few jobs available in 1933 with or without
a college degree, I was fortunate to be taken on as an apprentice
by Judson Mills (textiles) in Greenville, South Carolina. I had
the remarkable distinction of receiving a large increase in my
hourly rate before even going to work. I accepted the. job at
twenty cents an hour, but before I could get into the plant,
the NRA went into effect and the paymaster had to pay me
thirty cents an hour. My achievement was short-lived, how-
ever, as [ had to serve six weeks at the training pay of fifteen
cents an hour. The phrase “fringe benefit” had not been coined.

In 1936 I was transferred to Abbeville Mills as manager and
agent. Naturally, I was pleased at the opportunity, even though
I was advised that “no one else will take it!” The reason
became quite apparent as textiles were suffering as much as
any industry during the depression and I found that Abbeville
Mills was running one month and stopping one month —no
orders and little money. However, there is always an advan-
tage to starting with a plant at its worst: at least it cannot fall

[ 790 ]

much further regardless of its inexperienced management and
the many mistakes that go along with inexperience. In 1939
I was made treasurer of Abbeville Mills and held that office
until November, 1942, when I entered the Navy as a lieutenant
(j.g-) in the Supply Corps, a specialist in aviation.

Although the Abbeville Mills was a healthy, money-making
concern when I departed, it did not educate me too well in
the art of handling supplies for the Naval Air Force. After
two weeks of Naval indoctrination and two solid weeks of
reading the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts Manual, I was
made officer-in-charge of Fleet Aviation Central Stores under
Comairlant. I received sea pay for some years because of this
command, although my most dangerous endeavor was crossing
the Lynnhaven Bridge on the way to Breezy Point each morn-
ing. It was encouraging to realize how much could be accom-
plished by Reserve officers in the Naval Aviation Supply Corps,
but we admittedly had to forget the Bureau of Supplies and Ac-
counts Manual as that was hardly pertinent for such aviation
activity. I was separated as a lieutenant commander in 1945 and
now am on retirement.

From 1946 to 1948, like many G.L’s, we as a family attempted
something different with respect to vocation. We tried our
family hand at cattle ranching in Arizona. Being fifty-four
miles from the nearest town, seventeen miles from the nearest
post office and bar, nine miles from our nearest neighbor; hav-
ing no telephone, a mountain road, plus four children to edu-
cate, led us to believe that although a pleasant life, there must
be some other way to make a living. |

Since 1948 I have been associated with James Lees and Sons
Company, makers of “those heavenly carpets by Lees.” I am
director of industrial and public relations in an expanding com-
pany. My primary business interests lie in aiding and abetting
the furtherance of good management in all respects. I am still
convinced that where management is sincerely enlightened and
aggressive, the individual may be his own representative between
himself and his company and needs no outside organization to
preserve his individual dignity and to guarantee him a “square”
deal. In addition, an open shop gives him a better opportunity

and a better chance for advancement. This is what our com-
pany believes and practices. Surely some of the Class of ’33
may wish to argue that premise,

I still enjoy many forms of athletics, golf, tennis, riding, etc.
I am a member of the Church of the Good Samaritan in Paoli
and try to play a part in our local civic and political endeavors,

ONE clear and pleasant recollection of my youth is my
father’s Twenty-fifth Reunion in 1926. The reunioning class
seemed pretty mature, as I remember it, and we kids enjoyed
the experience of associating with the older generation under
the relaxed and cheerful conditions that prevailed. It makes
me very happy to look forward to having four children at my
Twenty-fifth this coming spring. Our oldest, Chris, is a sopHo-
more at Radcliffe, and Bert, our only son, is a senior at Exeter.
Liddy, 15, and Vicky, 10, our youngest daughters, are with

[ 792 ]

2§TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

us at home in Rye. I hope they will all enjoy themselves as
I did thirty-two years ago.

One needs to repeat numbers like the magic twenty-five to
drive home the fact that so many years have passed, years, in
my case, that have been full of the cares and joys that go with
bringing up a family and with work that has. been demanding
and rewarding in equal parts and in many ways. In the past
fifteen years it has taken me first to many parts of this country
and then to many parts of the free world; and while the life
of a traveling businessman is at times a pretty strenuous one,
nevertheless, the privilege of seeing the world and meeting
some of the people in it, even under less than ideal conditions,
is a real one and one for which I shall always be grateful.

It may be that life usually speeds up when one enters middle
age and that for a while at least the demand of one’s time
increases in a rather disconcerting way. The pace of business
and calls from the community seem to combine in a way that
makes it hard to lead the life one wants to lead. Both Liz and
I have found this to be true and we are sustained by the hope
that it need not always be so. We have found that life out of
doors is one wonderful offset to the pressures of life in New
York and its suburbs.

For a number of years we have spent our vacations in char-
tered: sailboats cruising the Maine coast. In the last two or
three we have been searching with increasing diligence for
land on salt water that we could use for vacations — and per-
haps some day for more than that. After a fair number of
frustrations we have finally got our hands on a piece of land
on Penobscot Bay. It is wild and completely undeveloped. I
wish we had found it ten years ago, Perhaps one day we will
have some kind of house on it and can hope that our friends
in the Class of 1933 will come down east and visit us.

IT is with some difhdence that I take up my pen to record these
facts about myself for two reasons. First, it is hard for me to
imagine that there could be anything of interest to anyone and
secondly, I have no intention of writing the history of my life.
John Dryden’s views, “anything though ever so little which a
man speaks of himself — in my opinion is still too much” should
not be lightly unheeded. Nonetheless, I am going to ignore this
wise advice,

After my rather early academical demise, at the firm sugges-
tion of the Dean, I took the first boat for France where life was
very agreeable and a rusticated student from Harvard was
treated with more deference than he would have been on the
banks of the Charles. The period 1933-39 passed all too quickly
for me and save for a not too exacting connection with a wine
firm, I paddled back and forth serenely from New York to
London to Paris on an excellent cask of red burgundy. Alas,
the demented Corporal from Vienna put an end to all this.

The war years found me in Paris with the American Field Serv-
ice and until that fateful day in May, 1940, when Jerry’s armor
struck at Sedan, life was easy and infinitely civilized. Our unit

[794]

was luckier than most and got out more or less intact. The en-
suing five years of the war I spent with the Canadian Army in
a somewhat more disciplined and military fashion and was de-
mobilized with the rank of captain in Holland, January, 1946.

After the usual postwar procrastination period, I finally moved
to a farm which had been in my family for many years and was
married to a girl who likes the country every bit as much as I
do. We raise Herefords and pointers. The dogs are hardly a
financial asset but acquit themselves reasonably well on wood-
cock and partridge at home and on quail at “Swamp House,”
Georgetown, South Carolina. This August I neglected my dogs,
cattle and wife for the glorious twelfth, opening day for grouse
shooting in Scotland. My penance was that I missed them all!

One last note. I have instructed my wife to be so kind as to
gather from diverse places — London, Oklahoma, New York and
Beverly — her assorted brood of children (four) and grandchil-
dren (ten at this writing) to pay homage to a very lazy step-
father at the forthcoming Reunion. A bottle of vintage port is
wagered to any classmates who can match this in numbers twenty-
five years out!

in Ordnance at Aberdeen, Maryland. My specific duty was in-
structing draftees in A.A. Artillery Maintenance. Shipped over-
seas to the Philippines early in May, 1945, and returned at
Christmas time the same year. Received my discharge in Florida
and spent several months with my wife and children on Anna
Maria Island, Bradenton, Florida. We returned north in the sum-
mer of 1946, and bought our present home at Rye Beach, a
hundred-year-old Cape Cod.

I entered the University of New Hampshire graduate school
in September, 1947, to study for my Master’s degree in education.
During this time I conducted classes in the Strength of Materials
Laboratory at the University. In September, 1949, 1 accepted
a teaching position in engineering at Phoenix Junior College,
Phoenix, Arizona. Our oldest daughter graduated in May, 1950,
from North Phoenix High School. The day after graduation
we left on a camping trip across the country to summer at Rye
Beach. Beverly started her nursing career and we camped back
across the country to Arizona for another year at Phoenix.

In the summer of 1951, we returned to Rye, having found
that the eastern climate was preferred by all. At this time, I
stacted work at the Portsmouth Shipyard in the Engineering
Department. The call of teaching lured me again in September,
1952, so I accepted an assistant professorship, School of En-
gineering, at Southwestern Louisiana Institute in Lafayette,
Louisiana, Judy was now married, having graduated from high
school the previous spring. Despite the fact that I enjoyed my
work, we all missed our home at Rye, so returned for good (?)
in June, 1953.

I returned to hydraulic control design at the shipyard and
shortly transferred to the newly formed Nuclear Power Division.

During the ensuing years, I have spent several months each
year obtaining special training in Washington at Bureau of Ships;
in Pittsburgh at the Westinghouse Plant; and in Groton, Con-
necticut, at the Electric Boat.

In my spare time I have instigated a ten-year plan to improve
the house and property. Have just finished an 18x13 addition to
the living room complete with fieldstone foundation and interior
paneling. My wife and I drew the plans and did all the work.
Next year we hope to start the breezeway and double garage

with workshop. We, as a family unit, have all enjoyed par-
ticipation in the local dramatic group, the Rye Players. The
repertoire throughout the years has included comedy, mystery,
melodrama, and some more serious works. Especially enjoy
directing and producing.

FOLLOWING graduation in 1933, I was fortunate in being
sheltered during the greater part of the depression as a student in
the Harvard Dental School, graduating in 1937. No sooner had
I established a fairly respectable practice than, like so many others,
I exchanged civilian practice for military duty, serving for nearly
three years in the U.S. Coast Guard as District Dental Officer of
the 1st Naval District.

Resuming private practice, ] have remained busily engaged
maintaining my patients in good dental health and function, The
realization that over twenty years of dental practice have gone by
becomes more frequently evident when my early child patients
now bring their own children in for treatment. This friendly
personal relationship with many people over the years, while
rendering an important health service, compensates to a great
degree for the many busy hours of physical and mental effort
that go into the practice of dentistry.

My “This is Your Life” presentation would be quite incomplete
without acknowledging the rdle that my wife has played these
past thirty years. Having “gone through” high school, college
and dental school with me, I am sure that she provided a great
part of the incentive to overcome many of the problems along
the way. Our daughter Nancy i is growing up fast, a joy to have
around, and a good example of why fathers love their daughters
so much.

I sometimes think that the confining nature of my work has
developed in me the urge to get beyond the limiting boundaries of
my office and travel. Perhaps it was the stimulating lectures of
Professor Edgell’s fine arts courses. Whatever the reason, I have
continued my travels during the past five years, visiting the
Caribbean Islands, and most of the European countries in several
trips abroad. This past summer we attended the Twelfth Inter-

national Dental Congress in Rome where I presented a clinic and
lecture.

Photography continues as one of my main interests. I now
have a very extensive library of colored slides which serves as a
fairly complete pictorial record of our holidays. Golf and ice-
dancing still are my favorite sports though I must admit my golf
handicap has been slowly increasing and my ice capades are
getting increasingly slower.

AS I start this biography I feel like the nervous expectant “who
wonders what will out after the heroic venture. However, the
task must be done so let’s onward. Twenty-five years ago, with
the blessing of President Lowell and possessed of a Harvard de-
gree, I left the hallowed ivy of Cambridge and ventured forth
into the depressed industrial world of the ’30s. I became af-
filiated with the Waterbury (Conn.) Manufacturing Company,
manufacturers of brass and copper items and lighting fixtures.
Here I spent five years of enjoyable and fruitful labor. I learned
the intricacies of the manufacturing world and saw how a small
brass ingot, that is heat-treated, machined and then polished, be-
came either a chromed faucet or a lacquered ashtray. My posi-
tions with the firm were many and varied. I did cost analysis,
estimating, drafting and chemical analysis in the material lab.
In 1939 I severed my ties with the brass and copper field and
joined the New Haven Pulp & Board Company of New Haven.

[ 799 J

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

For the next two and one-half years I learned the paper business.
It was fascinating. I saw old musty love letters, discarded text-
books and soiled newspapers chopped up and intermingled with
additives and chemicals, and out of this conglomeration paper
board was formed. The company was setting up an efficiency
and bonus system and it was my task to time each and every oper-
ation, analyze it and ascertain if it could be done more efficiently
and profitably, My relationship with this company ended with
“greetings” from President Roosevelt.

My war years were spent with the 13th and sth Air Force
in the Pacific, hopping from one island to another. At one time
or another I called New Caledonia, New Guinea, Luzon, Pal-
awan and Okinawa my headquarters. Need I say that all the
islands were alike, hot, sticky, wet, mosquito-infested and far
from glamorous. When I was separated in the fall of 1945, I be-
came interested in veterans affairs so I joined the Veterans Ad-
ministration in Bridgeport, Connecticut, as a training specialist.
I assisted in testing and counseling veterans who were seeking
rehabilitation or new careers and professions. The five years I
spent on this job were rewarding years. I saw how the G.I. Bill
was the impetus for new and profitable careers to many who
could not have achieved their dreams without the aid of the Bill.

For a number of years I had been interested in the problems
of the aged. To continue in this field, in August of 1950, I be-
came a field representative for the Department of Health, Educa-
tion & Welfare, Bureau of Old Age and Survivors Benefits
(commonly called Social Security). I am affiliated with the
Bridgeport office which services Fairfield County. My respon-
sibilities encompass the public relations, both radio and news-
paper, and the development of both old age and disability claims.
Every day brings a new experience — it may be the discussion
of Social Security with either a labor group or a retired college
professor — or perhaps the aiding of a farmer in the development
of his old age claim — or receiving the friendly smile of satisfac-
tion from an elderly couple to whom Social Security means a
little financial independence. To be a part of a program that has
become the American way of life truly gives a sense of pride and
satisfaction.

While affiliated with the V.A., I met a pretty green-eyed lassie

WHEN I left Harvard in 1930, not because I had learned enough,
but because I wanted to get the jump on the rest of the class, I
became involved in social work with the City of Boston Welfare
Department. It was just at the beginning of the Depression and
suddenly my case load started to rise rapidly. The work was very
interesting but voluminous, It continued as such until just before
World War II, when the case load dropped, but not for me.
Before I could enjoy some leisure time, Uncle Sam called and
once again my work became interesting but voluminous, It con-

{ 8or ]

tinued as such until I left Saipan in 1945 for home, After a short
time again with the Welfare Department, I accepted a position
with the Department of Mental Health where the work again
became interesting and voluminous.

I had never been at a loss for customers in my work, whether
they be the indigent, the enemy, or the mentally ill, until about
three years ago when I became associated with a real estate
firm. Then the customers became few, and what few there were
always had a strong desire to buy a house, but most times their
financial ability to purchase was not as strong as their desire to
buy. Then, too, in this field of endeavor the problem is to sell a
house worth $10,000 for $20,000 and to arrange to have a pur-
chaser buy a $20,000 house for $10,000. When you can do this,
and still keep on friendly terms with both the buyer and seller,
you have made a sale.

As far as our family is concerned, we are blessed with a healthy
happy family of one boy and two girls. Being occupied with two
positions, my leisure time is pretty much taken up. During the
time I spent in service at Uncle Sam’s request, 1 became interested
in photography and whenever possible I still try to keep this in-
terest alive.

As far as politics are concerned, I am a “Mugwump.” I don’t
believe either political party has cornered the market on all the _
brains and all the skills required to guide our government whether
it be on the Town, State, or Federal level.

My one regret is that I was not able to graduate from Harvard.
After the war I tried to pick up the rest of my education at North-
eastern University at night, but after two years, sickness forced
me to leave, I sincerely hope that William, Jr., will pick up
where I began at Harvard and be able to finish the job.

ber of Commerce; American Statistical Association; Monroe Golf Club.

HAVING drawn a job offer from Eastman Kodak, I became what
William Whyte would describe as an “organization man” when
I graduated from the Business School in 1935. I’ve been in staff
work for Kodak ever since then in the field of production con-
trol. Kodak offers the double advantage of a top-notch company
and a fine community. If the winter snows in Rochester would
either decide to stay away altogether or at least wouldn’t quickly
become a dirty slush, I'd say Rochester is an ideal place to live.
There are lots of things to do in this community. My wife and I
get in on a good share of the fund-raising drives and other civic
activities, in which Kodak people generally tend to assume a
leading role. For sports, I enjoy golf in summer and bowling in
winter.

We've taken on geology as one of our chief hobbies. While
my parents were living in Omaha, we took most of our vacations
out west, spending a while with my parents and then going on to
the Rockies to chip away at interesting formations in any of a
number of mineralized areas. One time, we heard that there
were aquamarines at the top of 14,200-foot Mt. Antero in central
Colorado. So we were determined to get a bit of an expedition
together and go take a look. However, when we got out there,
the natives, who were unaware that I was a Harvard man, told us
we were nuts, Antero evidently had last produced an aquamarine
many, many years ago. In view of our very amateur status as
mountain climbers, we finally saw the light and did some prospect-
ing in the flatter regions of southwest Colorado. Currently, my
parents are living in Florida, so we usually take a short winter
vacation down there and a summer trip into Canada for fishing
and a bit of “rock-hounding.””

TWENTY-FIVE years is a large segment of one’s existence,
but as I look back over the time since I left the hallowed halls of
Cambridge, I find that my life has been a full and a happy one in
spite of the tribulations and vicissitudes attendant upon establish-
ing my niche in the world.

After medical school and hospital appointments, I was in prac-
tice for two short years in Somerville, Massachusetts, when the
first reserve officers were called to active duty in 1941. I spent
five years in the U.S. Army Medical Corps and saw service in
this country, and then overseas with the Sixth Infantry Division
in New Guinea, the Philippines, and Korea, All of us have our
war memories, most of which we want to forget. . . . I shall
always recall the cable announcing the birth of my son, Richard
Neal, back home arriving in Luzon while my forward hospital
unit was being shelled heavily by the Japs . . . and I can never

[ 804 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

forget the first concert given by the liberated Philippine Sym-
phony Orchestra in a bombed-out church in the midst of the
devastation that was Manila.

I was discharged as division surgeon, a lieutenant colonel, and
received, in addition to the usual theatre decorations and battle
stars, the Army Commendation Ribbon with Pendant. The latter
was for work done while assigned to the Surgeon-General’s Office
in Washington, where I devised the disability discharge system
now standard in the Army, which has saved millions of dollars
for the government.

Our family was reunited upon my return home in 1946, when I
set up practice in Medford, Massachusetts, and we later built an
office wing to the comfortable old house which is still our address.
I am one of a vanishing breed —the family physician — and I
lead a rewarding life in the suburbs. I have no extensive list of
research publications, but my bibliography consists of my con-
tribution to society as a general practitioner. It is gratifying to
know that I have the respect, admiration, and trust of the patients
to whose illnesses I minister. I have delivered them and now I am
delivering their children. A good portion of my practice is
obstetrical since I have had specialized training in that field.

Our family interests are primarily cultural, and we are all avid
readers, We are especially proud of our two youngsters who are
“tops” scholastically in their respective schools. Judy is a senior
at Medford High School, a good athlete and a pretty, vivacious
blonde whom we shall miss very much when she goes off to
college next year. Richard is in the eighth grade, a fine boy with
an excellent sense of humor, who hopes to write Harvard '66

Our capable housekeeper, Della, has been part of the family since

Our hobbies are several, including our garden, where I tend the
roses; golf at which we both do moderately well; and photog-

adding constantly, Our hi-fi set is not merely an electronic
curiosity — it is always in use. We feel fortunate to be in such
close proximity to Cambridge, and we take advantage of all that
the University has to offer.

We are active in the affairs of our local Jewish Community
Center and temple. Evelyn is a past president of the women’s
group, and I have been on the board of directors for the past
eight years. Politically we consider ourselves Independents, and
we voted for Stevenson both times.

Several times a year the “ham” in me comes out and I entertain
at our local hospital and organizational shows. Summers we spend
several weeks in Maine, and we manage to get to New York as
often as possible to catch up on concerts and the theatre.

Ours is a depression Class that has experienced two wars, but
no one can deny that the twenty-five years have been most excit-
ing through which to live. In this age of Sputnik and the ICBM,

there is no doubt that a Harvard man will be the first to reach the
moon.

THE year of graduation from Harvard College found me self-
confident and triumphant. I was determined to become an at-
torney, a life-long ambition. My father’s death in October, 1933;
altered the course of study from Harvard Law School to one
nearer home, the University of Pittsburgh Law School, from
which I graduated in 1937. After a general law practice, I entered

[ 806 ]

government service and worked for the Internal Revenue Depart-
ment and Office of Price Administration during World War IL.

In 1939, when I made a trip to California, I acquired the desire
to become a California resident. My wife, Unnie, who became my
lifetime companion in 1943, assisted me in the realization of that
goal. In 1946 we packed our belongings and followed Horace
Greeley’s advice, accompanied by our daughter Pamela. Our
daughter Linda was born in Los Angeles a few months after our
arrival.

A varied business career led me to credit and collections, and
for the past four years | have managed a factoring concern which
purchases contracts from retail stores without recourse. We are a
growing concern and, realizing the need for credit, small retail
organizations have welcomed our services gladly. Throughout
my business experience, my contact with the law was always of
great advantage, so through the effective prodding of my wife, I
decided after nineteen years out of law school to take the Cali-
fornia Bar examination. I am happy to report a conquest and my
admission to the California Bar in June, 1957. My full-time day
position does not permit too much of a law practice, but I am
speedily acquiring the reputation of Gentleman Attorney, because
I have removed myself from the pressures and tribulations of the
attorney who must pursue his profession constantly to earn a
proper livelihood.

My wants are few. I am happily married and blessed with two
charming daughters. We thank God we are all healthy. Of course,
we are all disturbed by world events climaxed by the recent birth
of Sputniks I and II. We are highly confident that our country
will continue to meet the challenge and that the democratic ideals
of liberty under a rule of law will prevail. We deplore the tend-
ency of an age of mediocrity, and we hope for a return to the
true spirit of competition in which the desire for supreme achieve-
ment will dominate our society, tempered by the golden tenets
of the Golden Rule. We deplore the age of commercialized
specialization and hope for the return of the reduced tempo of
life where neighbors and friends can relax with you instead of
being caught in the maelstrom of speed to an uncertain and
dubious goal. Above all, we hope for a return to basic ideals —
a spirit of justice for all, tempered with mercy; a desire for

neighborliness in the world; an elimination of distrust and sus-

God and the Brotherhood of Man to prevail.

REMINISCING over a span of twenty-five years certainly
creates problems of evaluation. History has always been a sub-
ject of interest to me but not from an autobiographical analysis.
As with many a business career started during depression times,
any job was appreciated. Western Union was in an employing
mood at the time. After two years telegraming lost its glamour
and venturous appeal. Investment banking appeared far more

fruitful and, for eight years, The First Boston Corporation, Bos-
ton, taught me all the ins and outs of finance. Many major events
occurred during this span of years. The most important of which
was Ruth Fessenden who became Mrs. Onthank in 1937.

A slight interruption of two years occurred during this fi-
nance career when Uncle Sam needed some help overseas and
for some reason decided I would make an excellent machine-
- gunner with the Twenty-Ninth Division. After the war a yearn-
ing to change fields of occupation again became prevalent and
I became associated in the institutional furniture field. Too soon
I discovered all the problems that a small business experiences
in a large industrial field. However, I have become well-adjusted
and I enjoy the challenges of furnishing hotels, motels and
schools.

The most pleasant part of this reminiscing is reviewing the
events created by twenty years of marriage with a wife in-
volved in interior decorating and raising dogs interwoven with
growth of four children. The children lead off with Bobby now
nineteen, followed by Barbara-Lee, sixteen; Lynda, eleven and
Terry, aged ten. All of whom are now my hobby with the re-
introduction into the problems of education, jobs and just teen-
age living.

IT has been an almost impossible task for me to start writing this
“class life” account. I suppose it is because a Twenty-fifth An-
niversary Report suggests, if it does not almost seem to require,
“stock-taking,” and I guess I just don’t want to concede that I
am ready for that yet. So I shall simply refuse to do so and use
as my official excuse that bringing up as I am what actually
amounts to two generations of children at the same time (my
wife says we’re playing parents where we should be grand-
parents) keeps me so busy that I just don’t have time or, more
accurately, the energy, to take “stock.”

I suppose the key fact behind any account of my life since
graduation is that I just am not the type who has dominant or
dominating interests as to life work, hobbies, etc., but can pretty

[ 810 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

much enjoy doing any ‘one of a wide variety of things. Actually,
it was not until June of our senior year in college that I finally
decided I was going to law school, and I could have just as easil
gone into teaching (history) at that time and in fact had applied
for and received a graduate scholarship from the Graduate School
of Arts and Sciences. |

On graduation from law school, however, I did feel strongly
that it was about time I “got out” in the world, and I practised
law in Boston for about a year and a half. At that time I un-
expectedly was invited to be law clerk to Mr. Justice Stephens
of the United States Court of Appeals in Washington, and on
literally forty-eight hours notice found myself transplanted from
Boston to the District. Once in Washington, it was the usual
story of “Potomac fever.” I was, as a result, in the Federal service
for just ten years in the various housing agencies as they existed
with all their name changes during this period, and was assistant
general counsel and occasionally acting general counsel of the
present Housing and Home Finance Agency when I left the
Government service, late in 1948, shortly after Truman’s re-
election.

I am one of those who feel strongly that public service can be
one of the most satisfying and rewarding of activities, given,
particularly, the combination of challenging programs, the indi-
vidual opportunities to play a significant role in them, and the
superb leadership up and down the line that existed most of the
time I was in the service. The big difficulty, at least in the Federal
end of public service, is that it is the only occupation or pro-
fession I know that the better you are and the better you do, both
by way of accomplishment and job status, the less secure your
position is. This is true not only because of the inevitable changes
in administrations, but also because of the frequent changes as to
department or agency heads during administrations. In my case,
a particular appropriations sub-committee one year decided it just
did not like my agency at all, refused to report any appropriation
at all for it, with the result that everyone in the agency, including
the administrator himself, received a formal, ninety-day dismissal
notice pending definitive Congressional action, While there was
no question in anyone’s mind that Congress would not go along
with this report, as, in fact, it did not, this “did it” for me, and I

[ 811]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

decided that I had better start considering other possible ways of
supporting a family. I liked “challenges” but not that much,
Again it took me a long time to try to decide what I really wanted
to do, and finally the obvious occurred to me: combine the two
areas which I found it difficult to choose between in June, 1933 —
teaching and law. .
That is what I have been doing since 1949, and I am presently
a professor of law at the George Washington University in Wash-
ington. The big problem in teaching today is, of course, the salary
problem. When I first decided to go into teaching in 1948, even
then it was necesary to reconcile one’s self to a real “cut” in in-
come, but it was bearable at the time and also all the economists
were telling us we were in for a period of deflation. Today the
problem is how much of a sacrifice can one be expected to make,
and for how long, particularly if one has family responsibilities.
The magnificent leadership presently being manifested by our
alma mater in this regard is heart-warming, but unless our uni-
versities generally are able to follow its lead, there is no question
but that the general quality of our teaching and therefore of our
educational system is going to suffer immeasurably.

Nevertheless, teaching is a very satisfying activity. There is
just nothing more enjoyable than reading the paper of the real
“A” student, although I must admit there is nothing more de-
pressing than reading the paper of the mediocre student. (I have
other words for the very poor student.) I suppose the big question
to the teacher is: Is the student the better because he has had ge?
And this is particularly true in the case of a teacher in a profes-
sional school. To the extent that I have any basis for optimism
about the matter, it is mostly based on my experience as a student
rather than on my own abilities to appraise myself at this time.
(I am not displeased, however, to know via “the grapevine” that
my students, at least, place me in the “tough but good” category.)
The wonderful thing about having gone to Harvard is that it is
So easy to point to faculty member after faculty member about
whom you and I can say that we were the better men because of
having had them, and perhaps the one depressing thing about a
Twenty-fifth Anniversary is that at the very time when you want
so much to pay tribute to them, too many of them are no longer
with us.

[ 812 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

I don’t want to end this account on a depressing note, however.
I think I can say for myself as a teacher that somehow I have
managed thus far to be smart enough to keep up with my students,
and George Washington has its fair share of the top grade ones.
However, I had to give up long ago in trying to be smart enough
to cope with my children.

P.S. I love my wife.

We have been blessed with a goodly amount of family, com-
munity and church life, and are likely to have more as time goes
on, what with the fairly wide range of our children’s ages. We
have been reasonably active, perhaps a bit more so, in the familiar
works of PTA, Scouting, church, politics, Chest drives and so on,
most of which I should say have been rewarding as well as time
consuming and at times tedious.

Since I am not a writer I cannot do justice to the many things
and events, big and little, that have filled our lives over the years
and have, I believe, made them full. It is sufficient, but not very
interesting, to say that most of them have undoubtedly been the
same as many others in our Class of ’33 and so do not need in-
dividual repetition.

Since religious convictions are specifically mentioned in our
instructions, I should like to say that as the years have gone by, I
have become more and more convinced that this is God’s world
and that He is in control, despite all the damaging evidence to the
contrary, and that in the end His love will win. And so in the
future I should like to study and learn more about how to do His
will here and now, which I probably should have done in the first
place.

MY extra-curricular work at Harvard was trying to keep up

and law in industrial and economic life. It is still my main
effort, interrupted by three and one-half years’ imprisonment
by the Japs in the Philippine Islands. Including my wife and
three children, together with some eight thousand others, we
literally had to live on fides, spes, caritas hae tria. ‘The Japanese
were slaughtering by malnutrition and starvation. To their

in Spanish, finally had soya bean supplement the diet. Even
though late, it saved many lives.

TWENTY-FIVE less one years ago (I was a five-year engineer-
ing and business student) I set forth from Harvard to become
an additional unit in the statistics of the unemployed. I had
learned about the ups and downs of business cycles in Economics
I but soon found that there was no use I could make of this
knowledge insofar as obtaining a paying job was concerned.
There simply were no paying jobs for newly graduated civil
engineers at that time—even a Harvard Engineering School
graduate. After five months of fruitless door knocking, Har-
vardiana began to pay off —I landed a job as stock boy in
Filene’s. Two months later I was working as a janitor in a
hospital. Hardly an auspicious beginning for any career. But
the constant daily program of filling out applications for employ-
ment with both private and public engineering agencies now
began to produce more promising results — and my career got
a bona fide start.

In July, 1935, I was employed in an engineering position by
the Massachusetts WPA and a year later transferred to the
Bureau of Reclamation in Denver, Colorado. After three won-
derful years in Denver, but no progress, I transferred back east
to the Army Engineers in Providence, Rhode Island. And one
year later, in September, 1940, began the service in the Civil
Engineer Corps of the U.S. Navy which has continued uninter-
rupted to the present time. During this seventeen-year span
of service, I have had interesting tours of duty in Boston (twice
naturally), Norfolk, Virginia, and Cocoa, Florida, on the east
coast; Mare Island and Treasure Island in California on the
west coast, Guam and New Caledonia in the Pacific; and to
make the tour complete, three wonderful years in Corpus
Christi, Texas. While traveling geographically, I was also
traveling, though more slowly, up the officer ladder of success
from lieutenant j.g. to commander. Would that I had heeded
my father’s good advice and taken the N.R.O.T.C. course while
gaining an engineering education.

Lest the above give that impression, my career has not been
my major interest over the past twenty-four years, I believe

[ 818 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

the fact that I have fathered and supported seven children is
ample witness to this statement. It also serves to explain the
one-way correspondence between Steve Stackpole and me.

It all started shortly after graduation, Being broke and job-
less, I figured that two could starve more enjoyably than one
— and besides, my wife-to-be had a job. So we were married
in January, 1935. Then began the propagation of our wonderful
family of seven children including six girls and one boy. Except
for the tour of duty in New Caledonia during the war, I have
always had my family with me— unusual for a Navy man.
And perhaps almost as unusual is the geographical spread of
the children’s birthplaces —New Hampshire, Virginia, Texas,
California and Guam.

As for other hobbies, I am still addicted to sports, any and
all. I spectate on all transmissions via TV and actively partici-
pate in golf, tennis, badminton, bowling and skating. Once my
children become self-supporting, I hope to be able to afford
more frequent indulgence in all of these — but particularly
golf, providing I’m still ambulatory.

Politics and religion remain the same pet subjects of bull ses-
sions today as they were twenty-five years ago. I have staunchly
maintained my Catholic faith through the years in spite of the
strong arguments advanced by some of my atheistic classmates.
Whether or not they have seen the light, I can’t say right now
— but I intend to find out in June.

As for politics, ’ve done my best to choose between the lesser
of two evils. One time ['m a Republican, the next a Democrat.
To my engineering mind, which seeks simplicity and rationality,
we're supersaturated with special interest legislation — to the
detriment of the general welfare. I hope to discuss this further
with some of you in June. Until then — take care.

ON graduating from college I took the suggestion of Classmate
Pete Shuebruk, since corporations were not bidding for my
services, and started one of the earliest New England day camps.
As was appropriate in 1933, it was a real shoestring venture. I]
got a few down payments from parents, spent forty dollars for
a six-year-old Chevrolet in good condition (this was in 1933!),
got the use of a summer cottage in exchange for caring for the
owner’s child, and I was in business, with six children during
the first summer.

Three years later, after an unsuccessful one year bout with
the Harvard Law School, and an even less successful attempt
to sell life insurance, I went into teaching via the side door, my
motive being simply to continue with camp work, and have
continued with this combination of occupations until the present
day.

In September, 1940, I took a dual step seldom seriously con-
sidered by men of intelligence, namely getting married and at
the same time taking a year off from gainful employment. In
my case it was a singularly intelligent thing to do as I, at the
age of nearly thirty, had at last found the right girl; moreover,
for professional reasons, it seemed important to get more educa-
tion. Ergo, another year on the banks of the Charles. I have
never regretted either step. My year at Harvard was a very
rewarding one, and my seventeen years as a married man —
well, fun, companionship, understanding, love and the sharing

[ 821 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

of real troubles and small successes — these are the things that
make a marriage last and make you want it to last.

My daughter, Debby, is now fourteen, and I realize the pass-
ing of the years as we make plans to do a little preliminary
investigating of women’s colleges just in case she’s smart enough
and her father has money enough to send her to college in 1961.
As one who grew up among boys I am finding it delightful
though sometimes bewildering to be bringing up a girl child.

For some years my wife and I have enjoyed square dancing,
but for a few years now we have not felt it a matter of pride to
dance every dance during the evening.

In recent years I have become somewhat more involved in
civic affairs, winning my first elective office as a member of
the Wenham School Committee in 1955. It has been a source of
real satisfaction to be part of a group trying to improve the
schools of the town. In church work, it was a real pleasure a
year ago, to be a part of a very successful drive for capital funds
for a new education building.

My work has been a source of considerable pleasure to me.
Teaching has been more fun the past five years than before,
despite the pressure of large classes and the tendency of high-
schoolers to regard school as a part-time occupation. My first
love remains camp work, which gives me a chance to do many
things not possible in a public school and also adds real variety
to my life through the promotional work in winter and spring.

I hope that these twenty-five years have given us all the time
to have learned something about living and to have grown
enough in wisdom and humility to face the next twenty-five
years with equanimity.

As the boys have been growing up, I have served on troop
committees for Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts and have even gone
on overnight camping trips with the Boy Scouts, where, by
mutual agreement, the boys slept outdoors in sleeping bags
and the fathers slept indoors in more comfortable quarters.

It is very difficult to summarize twenty-five years in a few
paragraphs. If I have not already made it clear, I think I should
conclude by saying that I feel myself very fortunate in having
had a chance to be educated at Harvard and to have had the

business, professional and family life that I have enjoyed so
thoroughly.

ON the day of the Baccalaureate Sermon in 1933, accounting
myself lucky already to have a job, but with a twinge (or is
it tinge?) of regret that I was not participating in the festival
rites, I was operating a rotary can washer at the Bushway Ice
Cream plant on Windsor Street, just over the line in Somerville.
Thus began the first of three careers I have had since that Com-
mencement Week.

For the next eight years I nurtured the illusion that there
might be some future in ice cream for me, but at the same time

[ 826 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

a haunting thought was beginning to take shape on the horizons
of my mind, viz., that an A.B. in Economics from Harvard has
very little to offer to the dairy industry. In the fall of 1940 I
was faced with a crisis in the form of a wife who would soon
change from an economic asset to a mother. So I enrolled in
the Evening Division of the Bentley School of Accounting and
Finance in Boston, and in the following year began my second
career in the accounting department of Saco-Lowell Shops, also
in Boston.

For the next three years I continued at Bentley’s nights
while plying the trade during the day, graduating in 1944. Some
of the readers of this history will remember that there was a
war going on during this period, but I never got to see it, since
the company persisted in filing deferment applications and my
Draft Board in Phillips Brooks House kept right on granting
them. Along about the end of the war I was appointed assistant
secretary and given full charge over the company’s books,
financial statements and tax returns. I should have been satisfied,
but some vague unrest was stirring within me, resulting first in
a few attempts to make contact with the United Nations and/or
related agencies. This failing, I decided one evening in the fall
of 1947 to enter Harvard Divinity School the following Sep-
tember in order to prepare myself for the Unitarian ministry.
By this time another daughter had been added to the family,
so I thought it wise to continue with Saco-Lowell another year
in order to accumulate a little reserve. This I did and was duly
enrolled in the Harvard Divinity School, Class of 1951, to begin
my third career.

There were certain economic risks inherent in this venture,
as well as occasional rigors of the spirit, but all went well and
nobody was ever abnormally hungry. During my first two
years I served as student minister to the First Unitarian Society
of Whitman, Massachusetts — an invaluable training experience.
Having passed my general exams in the spring of 1950, I started
(as we say in the trade) in the fall, and in February, 1951, was
called to the First Unitarian Society of Gardner, Massachusetts.
Here in my first full time church I really got deep into the life
of the ministry, in all its ramifications, with all its demands,
frustrations and rewards.

[ 827]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

Now, in October, 1957, I have been three years in “The
Athens of the South,” which-also happens to be the heart of the
“Bible Belt.’ For a Unitarian, this is the frontier, and about
as big a change from New England as it would be for a Presby-
terian to emigrate to Tibet. This is a new church; I am the first
minister; the growing pains are terrific and so are the oppor-
tunities. In addition to working with a young and enthusiastic
congregation to build a strong church, I do what I can (which
is not half enough) to further my convictions re the brother-
hood of man in the community. This requires patience, tact,
tolerance, hope, humility and fortitude (of which I have not
nearly enough). But for all its aggravating vestiges of archaic
folkways and prejudices (what region doesn’t have them?)
I like the South and choose to remain here, for the foreseeable
future, at least. :

The girls are growing up—college looms for Elizabeth in
another year. She insists that she is going away to school, but
the facts of life may dictate otherwise. 1 must have a heart-to-
heart talk with her one of these days. However, we are not
impoverished. My congregations pay me splendidly for my
small services, and my wife, still a mother, is an economical
factor again after all these years as director of the Jewish Com-
munity Center Pre-School.

Of all the work I’ve done, the ministry is by far the toughest.
But the rewards are also greater—they must be or a man
couldn’t take it for long. At my age I don’t anticipate embar-
kation upon another career. But one never knows, does one?

TO summarize twenty-five years which represent all my adult
life, I find an extremely difficult task. Had I been a young man
with a Cause, or had I needed to set the world afire, I would have
won or lost by this time. In either event, I would have much
.to report. This has not been the case, for my ambitions have
been small ones, my successes in kind and my failures likewise.

I continue to find my business a source of great pleasure, not
the least part of which is the number of fine people with whom
I come in contact. In October, 1956, after many fruitless at-
tempts to find a capable bookkeeper and office manager, I con-
vinced my wife to help me out for the fall season. Since she had
no formal business training, she accepted with trepidation on a
purely temporary basis. She liked the change from housewife
and organization worker so much that she has become an integral
part of my business ever since. This has been a happy experience
for both of us, rewarding especially for me: for imagine lunching
every day with your secretary with no complaints from your
wife, and finding an attentive ear in your wife when you want to
discuss the day’s happenings in the evening! Much of my time
is spent in traveling and now I can do so with a freedom to de-
vote my energies to the business at hand without concern for
office detail. Somehow, to our amazement, the household does
not fall apart with the mother not on twenty-four-hour duty
at home. Our children seem to enjoy their added responsibilities,
cooperating more with one another; and now, they look forward
to time spent with that same mother they used to take for
granted.

[ 829 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

A year ago we sent our youngest child to camp and set off
with the two older ones for an extended tour through the South,
We visited most of the historic places and natural wonders en
route. It was especially gratifying to revisit some of the scenes
and see them through the eyes of our children. I certainly recom-
mend an automobile trip like this to bring a family close to-
gether and to instill in one’s children appreciation of our Amer-
ican heritage. This year the children have taken over the planning
department and are preparing a similar jaunt for this coming
summer.

As you can see, my time is mostly spent between business and
home, add to that some tongue-wagging bouts with friends,
some horrible attempts at oil painting, an occasional game of tennis
or squash, a bit of bridge, a quiet session with a book and a dash
of “Remember When” with old classmates and you have the
sum total of my life.

In re-checking this masterpiece, statements by Emerson and
Thoreau seem apropos: “You shall have joy, or you shall have
power, said God; you shall not have both,” and “The youth gets
together his materials to build a bridge to the moon, or perchance
a palace or temple on the earth, and at length the middle-aged
man concludes to build a woodshed with them.”

NINETEEN FIFTY-EIGHT marks the one hundred second
year that the Peirces have lived on their rolling Topsfield hills,
The acreage is smaller now and on one side Army Nikes rise
where cows once grazed. Some of the trees my grandfather
planted are just coming into maturity while time and the storms
have taken many others. My father’s plantings and those which
we made soon after college are filling the gaps. Sunny April
mornings are apt to find us doing more planting. At times it is
hard to hold the shovel while we discuss how a six-inch seedling
will look thirty years on. Recently, I discovered the fun of
propagating evergreens from cuttings. As yet the results are
tiny, but we shall have some fine specimens to show when the
Class is ready for its Fiftieth Reunion.

Come spring, we move to Wareham trailing two horses, pack-
ing in the dogs, three cats, a varying collection of ducks and
chickens and a Myna bird who calls me “Uncle Jack.” We live
there on another hillside where the pitch pines frame a view of
beach and pier with our two boats riding cozily at anchor. On
Saturdays, we race the smaller, a 12%4-foot M.LT. dinghy in the
teeth of the Buzzards Bay southwesters. The larger is a twenty—
four-foot, Dutch-built auxiliary sloop on which we sleep five.
Time is the only limitation on the fun we can have with this
craft.

In spite of the attractions of Topsfield and Wareham, the
practice of architecture continues to be my chief occupation.
Recent years have been busy with varied and interesting projects.
I have been active in the local chapter of the American Institute
of Architects as it works to improve the scope and quality of
our profession’s service to the public. This interest has led to
my helping write an up-to-date architect’s registration law which
was adopted by the 1947 Legislature and to four years of service
on the Massachusetts Board of Registration for Architects.

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

In a small town, almost everybody takes his turn at some aspect
of town affairs. I have chairmaned the finance committee and
have served on a succession of other committees whose duties
have included the writing and rewriting of our zoning and build-
ing by-laws.

Wartime saw me in the Navy where my four years were spent
mostly at sea in three escort carriers. U.S.S. Sangamon, “the
flying oilcan,” on which as ensign I was fighter-director, covered
the North Africa landings, saw service in the Solomons and the
Coral Sea and at the battle of Tarawa. After commissioning,
USS. Attu, a Kaiser carrier, did replenishment duty servicing
the big carriers off Iwo Jima and Okinawa. As navigator, I took
my last ship, U.S.S. Prince William, from Norfolk to the Philip-
pines. I am now a fully-retired lieutenant commander.

Last year saw an Episcopal Mission Church established in
Topsfield. To help in the start of a new church renews one’s
faith in people and in the purposefulness of life.

Our interests lead into the quiet backwaters apart from the
bustle of the main stream. We continue to lay foundations for
small projects which only the years can complete, but as we look
across our valley to the Nike Station, we are forced to contem-
plate man’s unwillingness to control his vast new powers of
destructive fission and fusion, his total inability to protect his
earth once the bombs are loosed and even to wonder whether
the Class of 1933 will ever reach a Fiftieth Reunion.

AS this narrative is written (late in October of 1957), the
United States is enjoying a troubled peace, considerable pros-
perity, and among other things, the prospect of travel into space.
At the time of our Commencement, the picture was quite dif-
ferent. Then, this country was faced with a severe depression
and its future looked bleak. Instead of jet planes, it was not
unusual to see biplanes in the sky. On the brighter side was
“Gold Diggers of 1933” (now on the late, late show circuit).

I soon found after graduation that jobs were not coming to
seek me out. Fortunately in 1934, the father of one of my col-
lege classmates did have an opening in the Boston area, but in
the insurance business, instead of banking which had been my
field of concentration. I am still with that company, the General
Adjustment Bureau, Inc. of New York. Besides Boston, I have
worked for them in Worcester, Mass. (1937); Portland, Maine
(1939-42); Brockton, Mass, (1951-54); and Manchester, N.H.

TO narrate a Latin American career within the precise limits
of understated New England phraseology and make it credible
is no easy task, but as readers of this sort of thing are always
benevolent, trustingly here goes my clumsy attempt.

Out of school and back at home I followed the “go west,
young man,” which in my case was “east,” and landed in the
highest mines anywhere. Shortly afterwards I changed the
mountains for desert coastal lands and had a fling at oil. Must
not be of the sturdy type, because although I did last’ more
in this job I certainly did not reach retirement age. Next step
was being a “bureaucrat” with a seven-year stretch that led
me to the post of Undersecretary. A change in the government
(not unusual in these parts of the world) made me present a
resignation, a voluntary act that could be compulsory if one
takes too long.

During my days as a “Big Shot” I think I did my war duty
to U.S.A., as the local Alien Property Custodian, for which job
I was officially commended by both English and U.S.A. Embas-
sies, Also as a parting gesture the government awarded me the
high decoration of “Commendador de la Orden del Sol.”

Then came ten years as a private businessman with once in
awhile having the honor of representing my country at inter-
national gatherings of commerce, economics or engineering.
My business activities were mostly attending the Boards of sev-
eral companies which ranged from the construction and erection

[ 839 ]

of neon signs in cosmopolitan Lima to lumber development in
the Peruvian jungle. Highlight of this epoch of my life was
the financial promotion of the Chimbote Steel Plant (27 million
dollars), and thus for the first time heavy industry in my
country.

In 1954 1 thought that Peru was in the clutches of another sadly
often small-time dictator, and considered my duty to conspire
for liberty. The reward for my pains was jail and banishment.
During my solitary confinement in prison the memories of days
along the Charles River were a rather comforting company.

Away from my country and interests I had the wonderful
luck of being considered as an “Industrial Economist Expert”
by the United Nations and deemed capable to be presented to
the Government of Paraguay as a possible “‘Adviser.” Paraguay
accepted me and has requested the renewal of my contract
for a third year in succession. Never have I been more happy
than with what I am doing now. Perhaps 1 it is because economics
is my hobby, and I am sufficiently vain to believe that my work is
good for the noble country of Paraguay.

And that is all, Now at forty-five, 1 do not have the ambi-
tions of years back (full acknowledgement of my limitations);
for an end I strive in my modest sphere praying that my efforts
will do for a better world and a happy family.

that by then two more Pfliickers would have been Harvard men.

Society of the Cincinnati; Society of the Alumni of the Presbyterian
Hospital.

AFTER graduation I completed two years at the Law School,
then switched to medicine. This necessitated another year in
the College, followed by graduation from medical school in
1941. An internship at the Presbyterian Hospital in New York
was interrupted by five years in the Navy, including two years
at a Base Hospital in the New Hebrides, during the second of
which J was head of the neuro-psychiatric service. Navy duty
ended with two postwar years in San Diego and a very pleasant
life for our family of five in nearby La Jolla. Returning to the
Presbyterian Hospital in 1947, I completed an assistant residency
in medicine. Since then I have not been formally engaged in
medical work.

The return from California saw us back again in Englewood,
where we have now lived (war years excepted) for twenty-one
years. Two vacations in Europe, prewar and pre-children, and
a third last summer with my elder daughter, now following in
her mother’s footsteps as a Wellesley freshman, are the high
points of my non-naval travels. Summers usually are spent as
much as possible in sailing on and around Buzzards Bay, and the
coinciding portions of three separate scholastic spring vacations
are apt to find us on skis at Stowe. .

That an altogether exceptional wife and three consequently
promising children are one’s greatest achievement is a feeling as
common to others as its expression in these pages may be rare.
Nor is there any claim to originality in the discovery that humil-
ity arrives so slowly because each value that stands in its way
has to be learned to be false.

OUR family consists of the same four individuals that I reported
on five and ten years ago. That does not mean there has been
no change. The children are taller, Adeline is more attractive;
I am older and balder. Most of our time has been spent in
making a living, raising our children, taking part in the many
activities of church, school and community affairs. Many prob-
lems have confronted us through the years, but they do not
seem nearly as formidable now as they did then. We can say
that life has been good.

Recently my work has necessitated quite a bit of traveling.
This combined with the activities mentioned above has kept me
so busy that I almost didn’t get the storm windows on this fall.
That is another one of those things that gets put off, like writing
class reports.

Watching our boys grow brings a great deal of pleasure to
us. We find ourselves feeling proud of them both. We par-
ticularly enjoy hearing of the trials and tribulations of a fresh-
man at Harvard. It is indeed interesting to see David going
through some of the experiences that came to me twenty-eight
years ago. I am also glad to become a little better acquainted
with the college program because of his participation in it.

My political and religious beliefs can be summarized very
briefly. I am persuaded that our nation can make an even
greater contribution to the world than it has done so far. We
have an abundance of resources, both physical and spiritual.
We can fail to make this contribution if we permit ourselves

[ 843 ]

to become frightened every time another nation develops a new
bomb or satellite. We can succeed if we pursue a steady course,
continually seeking for more knowledge and holding to our
faith in God and His Leadership. Such faith and seeking for
knowledge must be present in our statesmen, and also in the
rank and file of our citizenry.

It would seem that the next twenty-five year period should
be an interesting and eventful one for us all, one in which we
shall want to take part.

_ 25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

DURING the depressed era of the early thirties it was perhaps
not an unusual coincidence that a company headed by Harvard
alumni was willing to sign on a brand new alumnus as an
apprentice in one of their cotton mills. So it was that a quarter
of a century ago I entered the Fall River Mill of the Pepperell
Manufacturing Company and have been kept busy in the manu-
facturing, advertising and merchandising of cotton fabrics ever
since. As soon as the company realized I had contributed all
I could to their manufacturing division, and this all in a matter
of a few months, I was moved to the home office in Boston
from which base I have operated ever since. My work is pri-
marily concerned with merchandising fabrics for use in shoe
manufacturing, with occasional diversionary efforts in other
fields of industry.

My family has been all that anyone could ask for. The four
of us were fortunate to stay together during the war in which
my R.O.T.C. commission of ensign was gradually raised to
that of lieutenant commander. Donald, Jr., survived his fresh-
man year at Harvard, won his 1960 numerals in basketball, and
is presently living in Dunster House. Summers are spent mostly
at home in Hingham where we are fortunate in having an excel-
lent yacht club from which to operate our four-metre sloop.
Both Donald and Jane are enthusiastic sailors and between the
two our boat is kept buzzing on weekends answering the start-
ing gun. I am given the opportunity to see that the boat iS
maintained in tip-top racing condition.

In recent years my contact with the University has been

primarily through the activities of the Harvard Club of Hing-
ham. The time I have spent in interviewing prospective candi-
dates for admission and possible financial aid has been extremely
interesting as well as gratifying. The day last year when I had
the pleasure of telling a top-notch candidate that he had been
selected as a recipient of a Harvard National Scholarship with
the bulk of his expenses paid was indeed a red letter date in my
work on the scholarship committee, And to all of you who
haven’t had reason to check into the problems of entering ivy
league colleges today, I can only say you should be thankful
you made the prade twenty-five years ago,

YOU’VE pushed me to the wall, so I have to write something
to stop the avalanche of cards, letters and appeals that are using
up hard earned money trying to induce us to write our history.
Since the McCarthy inquisition experience, I don’t think it too
smart to write everything down, even for a Class Report; par-
ticularly when one’s opinions are not stereotyped by mob think-
ing.

I have had various jobs since graduation, in the meantime ac-
quiring a fine wife and two interesting children, all with minds
of their own. My wife is a credit manager for a small company
and her experiences with the people there plus the rather ribald
conglomeration of characters in my place of business supply
us with many interesting subjects of comparison and conversation.

As for World War II, I peddled soap during most of that
era, working for Procter and Gamble. A bad eye kept me out
of any voluntary service I applied for, and they didn’t seem
quite to get to me from the compulsory angle. It is probably just
as well, because I don’t particularly care for military conformity.
I am a registered Democrat, yet find some Republicans that are
more to my liking than the Democrats. I don’t belong to either
party really and veer from wishing there were no politics at all
to a technocratic view of a more efficiently run government.

My religious convictions are Unitarian in complexion, al-
though I attend a Congregational church with a minister with
whom I rarely disagree. What is important is the cooperative

spirit of the group in getting things done. Whether the sun
was made in a day or a million years is a matter of opinion which
can’t be agreed upon and in any case does not make any difference
to our daily problems.

The present-day world is indeed a challenge for one and gives
one a chance to exercise individual judgment in apposition to
much of the current fads of opinion, Whether one wants to go
to the moon or not is his own choice. I sincerely hope that all
the Bolsheviks take the earliest missiles to the moon and stay there
ad infinitum. Our world will then be a more peaceful place for
everyone.

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

IN company, I imagine, with most of my classmates, I have
drafted and redrafted this little offering mentally any number of
times, seeking vainly to reconcile the very factors which always
conspire to endow the obligatory confession with an air of self-
conscious unreality, while depriving it of any wit or flavor what-
ever. I have tried gamely to meet this most unwelcome deadline,
almost, you might say, by the Jules Verne method, for I have at
least had this thing on my mind on two continents and high above
the seas dividing them. But the knowledge that you will soon be
in print is seldom taken lightly, especially when the first person is
so intimately involved. And by the way, have you read any good
autobiographies lately?

Well, from where we sit, the spring of 1958 is really going to
be something. Along about the end of March, daughter Sue is
going to make us admit that we're very proud grandparents. On
the seventeenth of April we're going to throw a switch and open
Uncle Sam’s fabulous pavilion at the Brussels World’s Fair. And
then, if the building doesn’t collapse, we'll try to head back to
Cambridge for that party we’ve been hearing about.

Suffering as I still am from my unadulterated revelations, as
carried in the Class memoirs of 1948 and 1953, I am reluctant to
add fuel to the fire at this time. Hobbies, providentially, remain
the same; interests substantially unchanged; although I find myself
more deeply concerned than ever before with the American
posture abroad, with the impact of our way of life upon a world
confused and divided, most of all with the consequences of our
actions and convictions for the society of free men.

In this year of stock-taking, I am rich in pride and happiness
for a daughter who has just become the apple of another man’s
eye, even if he did go to M.LT. (it’s very comforting these days
for an impoverished humanist to have a promising engineer as a
son-in-law); a son who by some miracle managed to get into
Harvard and stay there, and a most challenging job to which I
look forward. I claim the questionable distinction of being the
only director emeritus in a Class notoriously studded with museum
specimens, And J am still married to the great and wise woman
who, just before Commencement in the hallowed year of 1933,
resigned herself to share this veil of fears with your faithful
correspondent.

UPON leaving Harvard in 1933, some classmates and I decided to
see the world, outside of Boston, so hopped a student-class
German ship for Europe. We spent a month cycling through
Germany, another month trying to take in the rest of Europe.
After arriving back in New York, penniless but happy, I took a
freighter through the Canal to San Francisco and started working
for Williams, Dimond & Company. In 1937 I married my present
wife and subsequently had three children: Harry, Carolan and
Jeanne.

When World War II came along, I received a telephone call
from a Harvard classmate, Tom Torrey, asking if I would come to
Washington, D.C., and work for the War Shipping Administra-
tion. So I parked my wife and children, aged four, three and one,
with my mother and proceeded to Washington for a year, after
which I was transferred to San Francisco for the duration. Then
we settled in Hillsborough. I returned to Williams, Dimond &
Company and have pursued my hobbies of hunting, fishing and
traveling occasionally to the east coast, Mexico, Canada and
Europe for business and pleasure.

This report would have been entered sooner, but due to the fact

occupaTion: Military service; commander, U.S.N. Line.

IN 1935 I graduated from Business School and had the cold,
cruel world staring me in the face. In Business School I had
specialized in selling and merchandising, but couldn’t seem to
find anybody who would properly compensate me for my talents.
About this time my fiancée’s father invited me to join his small
New England manufacturing concern that had been very pros-
perous in the ’20s but was up against stiff competition in the ’30s.
One condition was that I] would start at the bottom and work up.
Well I started at the bottom and I must say that I received excel-
lent training in all aspects of the business from the purchase of
materials, through manufacturing, to selling and last but not least
in collecting bills. Things finally worked fairly well for me,
although at times the tax collectors and the union steward went
away with the lion’s share of the money.

My wife and I had four wonderful years living in and around
Boston till the ex-paperhanger decided he wanted to emulate
Napoleon. Then in 1939, as I had a commission in the Navy
through R.O.T.C, and was active in the Naval Reserve, I volun-
teered for active duty taking what I thought at that time was a
short leave of absence from my business to enjoy my hobby,
the Navy. I figured at this time that the invincible French
Army would have the war over in 1940. A slight miscalcula-
tion! My first assignment was to the old carrier Ranger where
I remained for three years, then other sea duty assignments
throughout the war. In 1945 I decided I enjoyed the service
and would make it my career. My service has been at sea and

[ 850 ]

ashore. During the Korean War I was in charge of officer
procurement and recruiting in the Boston area. This was inter-
esting, but I am afraid it wasn’t beneficial to my career. At
present I am living in the Bethesda section of Washington and
assigned to duty in the Pentagon working on logistic war plans.
Most of the time I am worried about the Jarger problems but
this duty calls for a lot of frustrating and meticulous hard work.
For instance, the service being the service gets down to details
like the choice of words. Some of my most baffling moments
have occurred determining whether to use the word insanitary
or unsanitary, inactive or deactive, or to differentiate between
materiel and material. Webster has some of the answers but still
there is the right way, the wrong way, and the military services
rightly or wrongly develop terminology that eventually shows up
in Webster’s little book as authoritative.

As for hobbies, don’t ask a man with four kids about this; my
free time is taken up with family affairs which go on twenty-
four hours a day. We have both a young family and an older
group so that some come in late at night and the other group
gets up early in the morning. The parents sleep when and if
they can.

[ 852 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

In 1938, married Rosalie Williams and resumed my formal edu-
cation, studying at New York University Schoo] of Architecture
in my “spare” time, In 1941 I received my degree in architecture
after which we moved from the city to the shores of Cold Spring
Harbor, and I went to work for the Navy as a civilian inspector
of plants holding Naval contracts. After Pearl Harbor I was
commissioned lieutenant (j.g.) to do the same type of work.
When a policy change shifted this work to the Army, most fellow
“experts” were assigned as gun crew officers on freighters on the
“Murmansk Run,” but I had the good fortune to be sent instead
to the Naval Operating Base at Bermuda, then under construction,
where I served as staff security officer, a fascinating assignment in-
volving close contact with Army, Navy and Air Force units of
several countries, all operating under the unified command of the
U.S. Naval Commandant there. An interesting and pleasant tour
of duty, even though no service families permitted there at that
time. |

In the summer of 1944, I was transferred to similar duties at the
U.S. Naval Air Facility, Trenton, N.J., a station engaged in test-
ing and installing confidential equipment on Naval airplanes. Dur-
ing this period we lived in Princeton, made many friends and liked
it so much we thought seriously of settling there!

After my release from the Navy as a Lt. Cmdr. in October
1945, we returned to live in Cold Spring Harbor. I resumed work
in New York City, took the state examinations to practise archi-
tecture, and became a partner in the firm of Geo. B. Post & Sons,
Architects, founded in 1860 by my grandfather, one of the most
distinguished architects of his day, and carried on with distinction
by my father until his death in 1951. A tough tradition to try to
maintain! .

I am now registered in some eight states and engage in as broad
a range of work as possible believing firmly that specialization,
although profitable, is less fun, less stimulating and in fact stultify-

ing. Our recent practice includes residences, hospitals and medi-
cal buildings as well as institutional buildings, commercial build-
ings, such as office and bank buildings, and industrial buildings,
such as warehouses, factories and showrooms.

Since the war our home life has been ideal, though hectic, with
our family now consisting of three boys and two girls. We have

built on a lovely hilltop site overlooking the harbor, with sailing,
swimming, tennis, and now an ice skating rink close by. Car pool-
ing and a wide variety of professional and civic activities leave
little time for other things, but we occasionally get away for some
fishing, cruising or skiing — and what more could anyone want!

HARVARD BROTHER: Richard McMahon Powell, ’35.

occupation: Teaching; head of Mathematics Department, Haverford School.

AFTER a short stint in the summer of 1933 in the chemistry lab-
oratories of the Scott Paper Company, I accepted a teaching posi-
tion at the Admiral Farragut Academy, Pine Beach, New Jersey,
feeling that I preferred to spend my life associated with young
people rather than in industry. I taught mathematics mostly. In
1938 I became assistant headmaster, and in 1940, headmaster of the
Farragut Academy. |

The splendid opportunity of this position came to an abrupt
end four years later when I was discovered to be seriously ill with
tuberculosis. A year in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and three
years more at home brought recovery.

Following this four-year “vacation,” I was employed as a
teacher of mathematics at the Haverford School on Philadelphia’s
Main Line. One year later, in 1949, I was appointed head of the
Mathematics Department, and this has been my occupation to
date. :

My chief interest in addition to my family and profession has
been in the realm of church activities, During my high school
days I made the most important decision of my life: I accepted
Jesus Christ as my personal Saviour. The peace and joy which
He gives to those who know Him have been the mainstays of my

[ 854]

life. Because of this vital relationship with the Son of God, I
accepted a part-time position as pastor of the community church
during my years at Farragut Academy. This ministry was, of
course, halted at the time of my illness. In recent years my
Christian service has consisted of Sunday School teaching and
filling various assignments at church.

My eldest daughter holds an R.N. and an S.B. from Wheaton
College in [linois, and is presently a nurse on active duty. She
contemplates marriage in December. The middle girl is attending
business college in Philadelphia, while the youngest is a senior in
high school. She expects to follow her eldest sister’s lead by
attending Wheaton College.

The Class asks for a statement of our convictions. Mine can be
adequately summarized in a quote from Bill Graham, “The Bible
says ”

and incidentally the hired men of my Father’s company. I am in
charge of sales for Wyatt, Inc., who operate a bituminous coal
and industrial and domestic fuel oil terminal in New Haven, selling
industrial and domestic fuel to consumers in Connecticut and
western Massachusetts.

A year after leaving college I was married to the girl next door
and have one son, Allyn, now a senior at Colby College in Water-
ville. I lost a little boy through an accident in 1943 when he was
three. My hobbies changed with the age of my son. I’ve been
through the Cub Scouts — Cubmaster, seven years — Boy Scouts
as Commissioner — Town Recreation Committee and _ baseball
coach during his teens. I still find as much time as possible for
duplicate bridge and have just a few points to go to be a life
master. Hope a game with Lovett, Berol and Bernstein will be
possible at Reunion.

In recent years ve been doing some work with the Harvard
Club of Connecticut. Those who follow our teams will recognize
Orville Tice, Bob McVey, Dave Brigham, Mike Donahue as

to please the Admissions Office with some local leaders who are
not necessarily muscular.

I’m a Republican by inheritance and have found no reason to

then three and a half years of virtually dry land U.S.N.R. duty
from Appsea to lieutenant commander. Right back to the same
old desk in Boston’s first and most superannuated skyscraper
(Ames Building — best view of city and harbor) where for-
tunately said desk never seems to get cleared off. Practice chiefly
of the non-world-shaking office and probate court variety, but
good fun nevertheless. I sit on the Probate Committee of the
Boston Bar Association which is making some interesting efforts
to shake a little of the dust of the Middle Ages from off this branch
of the law.

We live in Wellesley and the daily commute has the bright spot
of a brief, distant glimpse of the College towers and the river, and
it never fails to be a source of pleasure. Summers since marriage
have been spent mostly in nearby Manchester in, on, or at the
edge of the water. We have had the rewarding but strenuous
experience of three children under four years of age. Now we are
looking forward to the prospect of the reverse Class Baby, who
has got to be off the two o’clock feeding by the Reunion.

I remain allergic to politics; have recently given up smoking,
after nearly thirty-five years, am addicted to reading musty

delightful wife of similar tastes. On graduation I had no idea that
twenty-five years later I would have so much for which to be

IN such a period of dramatic economic, social, and political
change, one man’s twenty-five years seem insignificant. Yet I
would not, if I could choose, live in any other era. Never in such
a short span have man’s horizons of knowledge expanded so ex-
plosively. It is an exciting time to be alive.

I spent the depression years after our graduation at the Law
School, an experience far more rewarding than I realized at the
time. Although I no longer practise law, I find that my legal
background and the method of thinking taught at the Law School
are of daily value to me. Upon graduation, I practised with the
firm of Goodwin, Procter & Hoar in Boston for four years. In
the late summer of 1940, becoming convinced that war was in-
evitable, I volunteered for active duty in the Navy.

My war time lot was better than most, my assignments were
usually interesting and challenging. I started out teaching in the
local Defense School, was soon sent to sea for a year and one-half
in the North Atlantic on the battleship Texas, and then spent a
delightful interim at the Naval War College in Newport, first as a
student and then as an instructor. The last two and one-half years
of the war kept me in the Pacific on the staff of Admiral Nimitz,
commander-in-chief of the Pacific fleet. I ended up with the
rank of commander and the title of fleet navigator.

[ 858 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

In 1946 I joined the nation-wide stock exchange and invest-
ment banking firm of Paine, Webber, Jackson & Curtis, as counsel,
and was made a partner in 1950. My work is concerned princi-
pally with firm management problems and the underwriting end
of the business — raising money for industrial companies. This
carries me all over the country and gives me an intimate look at
all kinds of different businesses.

In the fall of 1954, to my great surprise, the President asked
me to come to Washington as Assistant Secretary of the Navy.
The next two and one-half years were the busiest and most in-
teresting of my life. It was a fascinating experience to participate
in the inner workings of the government, and gratifying to dis-
cover that the vast majority of the top people in government,
whether elected, appointed, or civil service, are genuinely con-
scientious, dedicated, and able. Most businessmen go to Washing-
ton with the idea that they will “get things on the track in six
months.” They quickly learn that they cannot. Our govern-
ment is so big and so complicated that it takes a long time to get
things done. Several of the ideas initiated early in my tour were
just beginning to come to fruition when I resigned in 1957 to
return to my investment banking firm.

Business, charitable activities, my wife, and our five children
with an age span of more than eleven years, fill with their varied
interests most of my waking hours. Long distance cruising and
racing, which used to occupy most of my summers, have now
become a briefer family cruise, and long ski weekends have be-
come an afternoon on a nearby slope.

I am storing up plenty of things to do when I retire. My only
real complaint is that life is so busy and full that I don’t have
enough time for reflection.

I THINK, looking back on it through almost twenty-five years,
that the course of events for me during that period could scarcely
have diverged further from my expectation and intention when
I indicated “business” in the Class Yearbook as my proposed
metier. Since, in June of 1933, the lines and bars on all the eco-
nomic charts had dipped to historic lows for modern times, I was
realistic enough not to be specific about my proposed career other
than that it should be something in business. And, in fact, that
is how it started. First I was a member of the executive training
squad at R. H. Macy & Company in New York City, then an as-
sistant buyer for L. Bamberger & Company in Newark, New
Jersey. After that I became assistant to the sales manager of the
California Milling Corporation in Los Angeles. Then I took a
full year off from business to do some graduate work in which
I was interested at M.LT. I had been back at work again for
a few months — this time in advertising and sales promotion for
Sheffield Farms Company in New York City — when I heard
the news of Pearl Harbor while spending the weekend in the
country with friends. The War broke the pattern, and it hasn't
been the same since.

J enlisted in the Army early in 1942, was commissioned a second
lieutenant, and after assignment to training camps in Virginia,
Florida and California and exposure to the fast, wartime course
at the then Command and General Staff School at Fort Leaven-_
worth, Kansas, was shipped to the European Theatre. I was
there — and had become a lieutenant colonel — when the War
ended. By then the French Army was reactivating its Ecole de
Guerre in Paris in the buildings of the Ecole Militaire (situated
at the far end of the Champ-de-Mars from the Eiffel Tower). A
few officers from armies of other nations were assigned to the
early classes, and I was one of the first Americans to be so assigned,
The French officers in the school were for the most part from the
old military families, and in working with them and traveling
through France and Germany with them on field trips I developed

[ 860 |

great respect and affection for them. Perhaps my feelings were
enhanced by the rather less admirable qualities observable at that
time in some of their countrymen. .

Since, however, I had listed “business” in the Class Yearbook
as my intended occupation, I thought it was time to get back to
it. Therefore, in the summer of 1946, I requested and received
discharge from the Army at Fort Bliss, Texas. I returned to my
old home — Phoenix, Arizona — and launched a business of my
own, citrus packing (which includes marketing). I had at first
one partner and later, two, and in the summer of 1948 they pur-
chased my interest in the firm, the immediate reason being that I
had been recalled to active duty with the Army as a result of the
international tension and consequent limited but rapid military
build-up which occurred that year. I was assigned to Head-
quarters, Sixth Army at the Presidio of San Francisco for what I
thought would be a tour of several years at most. That expecta-
tion proved to be in error, however, as I am still on active duty,
though still as a reserve officer. My reserve rank is colonel and my
active duty rank is lieutenant colonel. I am a specialist in strategic
intelligence and am assigned to the Office of the Assistant Chief
of Staff, Intelligence, in the Pentagon.

My experiences since recall have been very interesting and
quite varied. I remained in San Francisco for the first year, then
followed three in Washington, D.C., and after that four in Paris
at Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers, Europe (SHAPE). By
the time this is published I shall have been back in Washington
for two years.

The European tour of duty was particularly enjoyable, making
possible extensive official and private travel in every country
west of the Iron Curtain from Turkey to Scandinavia. The as-
sociation with representatives of our allied nations was close and
friendly, and an unanticipated dividend was the gradual absorp-
tion of some of their languages. Eventually, I passed the Army
language tests in Italian, German, Spanish, Dutch, French and
Portuguese.

The personal side of my life during all these years could not
have been better, In 1943, in St. Augustine, Florida, I. married
Charlotte Sumner of Louisville, Kentucky and Vermont. We
didn’t see each other very often thereafter for several years, which

[ 861 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

probably was the reason that our first child, Judy, was not born
until 1948, in Phoenix, Arizona. Sally, the second, was born a
year later in Louisville. Marie followed in 1952 in Washington,
and Tommy, the last at last, arrived in Paris in 1956. They are all
four good, sound children, but they are still so young and are so
close together in age that their care and management dominate
our daily existence. Perhaps many of the rest of the Class know
just what I mean.

Despite the fact that more than half of my time since graduation
in 1933 has now been spent in active military service, as a reserve
officer I do not regard the Army exactly as a career. While much
of my work has been fascinating in the extreme, I suspect that I
may yet try my hand again at “business.” Sooner or later I think
I shall devote my time to the interests I have acquired through
the years in various ventures, investments and speculations. Time,
and perhaps Sputnik and related developments, will tell whether
or not this will come about.

I made no entry in the “Class Life” form in the space for
membership in clubs, societies, etc. Those to which I have be-
longed include several technical and trade societies, several athletic
clubs —in two of which I lived at different times during my
bachelor days — a university club, a speakers’ club, a Rotary Club
and even the original Post No. 1 of the American Legion in Paris.
At present, I have dropped all of them, owing mainly to the exigen-

A REVIEW of twenty-five years of one’s life seems to lead to
a much greater appreciation of Mr. Marquand’s Henry Pulham
and leaves the mind alive with memories but the pen strangely
reluctant. .

I spent the first four years after graduation in the circulation
department of the Boston Herald-Traveler and thereby learned
much about the geography of Greater Boston, the vagaries of
newsboys and the irascibility of the average suburbanite. In
1938, I entered the field of municipal government with the Town
of Belmont; from 1942 to 1946 participated in military activities
in World War II; and in 1946 returned to Belmont spending the
next four years deep in municipal records, accounts and budgets.
During this period J attended the Bentley School of Accounting
and Finance in Boston and graduated from the evening school
in 1950.

In September of 1950, a rather cursory association which I
had maintained with the Army Reserve program since 1946
suddenly matured into a full time connection and I spent the
ensuing seven years in Virginia, Korea, Japan, the Philippines,
Okinawa and Georgia.

Now I am happily back in the municipal administrative field
in the metropolitan Miami area. We have acquired a new home,
are delighted to be living in what we consider the finest climate
in the country and I have high hopes of resuming my neglected
golf game in the near future.

TRYING to find the time to write a few words for the Twenty-
fifth Anniversary Report of 1933, finds me scribbling hastily on
a Sunday afternoon with two business tasks ahead before a late
bed-time. This situation is strictly normal and is the one char-
acteristic of twenty-five years of my life.

Tam one of those eternal optimists who always feel that “after
we get through this particular phase, things will ease off and we
can live more leisurely” — only they never do.

My present position is executive vice-president of Nashua
Corporation, Nashua, New Hampshire, a paper converting com-
pany operating a widely diversified manufacturing plant in the
U.S. and two smaller plants in Canada. It is an extremely inter-
esting business but its complexities are such that constant attention
by a large staff is required.

My good wife, Julie, puts up with all this and has long since
acquired a stoic attitude, vacationing, aside from a trip to Cuba,
alone at the lake ensconced with a ravenous group of now teen-
agers (previously just ravenous), doing the chauffeuring and the
never-ending culinary chores with weekend visits on my part
accompanied by our guests. We are coming closer, however,
to our European trip with two offspring off to school, and the
third one nearing his departure. Julie smiles at this since our
possible 1958 trip is now postponed due to a fast business trip
to Europe which I must take — well, maybe in 1959 we might
make it together.

As to hobbies, thanks to the airplanes, I’ve been able to indulge
my enthusiasm for the outdoors, fishing for sea run salmon in

the Sedgwick River, New Brunswick, to tarpon off Boca Grand,
shooting woodchuck in Nova Scotia to duck in Arkansas, hunt-
ing wildhog in Florida to antelope in Wyoming. These trips,
however, are of short duration over long holiday weekends or
taking an occasional Friday or Monday. The aim of my family
at the moment is to repair to the country to a large, comfortable
old farmhouse which Julie is searching for with grim determina-
tion. |

The twenty-five years have passed with an incredible rapidity
and when Julie and I look back on them we see little we would
change — they have been busy, happy, rewarding years leaving
us with a fine family which we rather regret is growing up too
fast.

PLOUGHSHARE until 1942, I was beaten into sword by the
Harvard Physics Department’s Engineering 273. Pierre Le
Corbeiller, now significantly molding the undergraduate cur-
riculum in the physical sciences, was then a French officer who,
escaping the German Occupation, was serving his country, per-
haps better than he knew, teaching those who were to be radar
officers the mathematical description of electrical phenomena.
Throughout the war I encountered men whose skill at technical
improvisation in time of need they traced to his teaching.

tory, I found myself a “prisoner of war,” held there for the dura-
tion by the value of Le Corbeiller’s teaching in achieving en-
gineering objectives when wartime shortages of materials and
time made the conventional engineer's approach unacceptable.
Remaining after the war, I expected that we would be in a position
to apply what we had learned to techniques of scientific investi-
gation. That this has not been the case is, to me, a source of
humiliation and frustration, in spite of our continuing success
in meeting the challenge of military problems.

SCHOOL teaching (Middlesex in Concord for seven years),
military service (instructor, administrator, and intelligence officer
in Air Corps for four years), printing (Riverside Press, Houghton
Mifflin Company for ten years), and now roaming the globe and
working for whatever sort of an organization will hire a screwball
with a yen for public service, I seem to have found the greatest
satisfaction in the broad field of cultural relations or international
exchange. I left the Riverside Press in 1955, went to Manila, P. 1,
on a fascinating assignment for six months with FOA (now ICA),
and returned to stumble across the Salzburg Seminar in American
Studies. I signed on with them first to raise money for six months
— my only completely sales experience and one I’m glad to have
had —and then for two years as assistant director in Europe.
This operation appealed to me because of its international flavor,
its educational purpose, and its European setting; it offered the
perfect opportunity to get my family abroad.

In the sixteen months that I have been in Europe I have not
been disappointed, I travel much through western Europe, but in
living intimately for four weeks with a group of fifty or sixty
mature and intelligent Europeans (which we do six times a year),
I believe that we are in the best possible position to come to know

German, and a wife who has had to become here in Salzburg
nearly a professional librarian, I feel secure for the future.

SINCE the Vicennial Report, “‘my” company for fourteen years,
American Paper Goods Company, was fattened up and sold in
late 1954 to one of the industrial giants. So I had my first real
vacation since the forty-five-day leave the Army gave me when
I returned from Europe. I poked into a number of different fields,
_ stock brokerage, real estate, banking and even took a hard look
at setting up a cup manufacturing business in New England. But
in the end I decided to stay in the paper converting field, where I
feel quite at home, and join an established company. On January
2, 1955, I joined Rochester Envelope Company as director of
sales. We moved to Rochester in June of 1955, and have found
ita delightful and friendly city, though Jim-C, our senior son,
still pines for the woods and fields of Connecticut.

THE Report Committee has asked the question, and I must try to
find an answer: “Quigley, what happened to you during the last
twenty-five years?” If I am honest I must say, “Not much.
Certainly nothing of importance to the world.” When I look at
myself, I see little change. I still spend much of my time reading,
thinking, and writing. So little of these activities is observable
to others that J must seem to have had a dull life. As a matter of
fact, to me it has been very exciting. But to the Class of 1933 the
only observable change must be that I now have a wonderful
wife and two sons, am much happier, and have a greatly improved
digestion. I am sure that there is a causal linkage between these
three things; the family improving the happiness, and the happi-
ness improving the digestion. In general terms, that is my bi-
ography over a quarter of a century.

At graduation I won the Dillaway Fellowship and thus began

older boy has spent his summers at camp on an island in Lake
Winnipesaukee. Now, a skilled canoeist and a senior life saver
in swimming, he is a junior counsellor in the same camp. His
younger brother is enthusiastic over lepidoptery, baseball (where
he bats about .400), and soccer.

Looking back over the past twenty-five years, 1 must admit
that there is nothing notable about them. But they have been
good to me, and I can ask no more than that the next twenty-
five be equally good. The material rewards have not been great,
but we have lacked nothing important. My wife, who is a
talented university administrator, has earned enough to allow our
sons to go to expensive private schools and summer camp, and
even to provide me with a small English car occasionally; while
my income has kept a good roof over our heads and excellent
food on the table, leaving, I regret to say, but little over for the
Class Fund or Harvard’s Endowment. On this last matter I hope
to do somewhat better in the next quarter century than I have
done in the past.

As my history above indicates, I finally abandoned my state of

I NEVER cease to wonder why life treats me so well. At least
in my humble opinion I am treated very well. Of course, many
of my classmates will wonder why I think I am well off. Per-
haps the answer is that I am very happy to be doing what I am
doing, and that I am glad that they are doing a lot of the things
that have to be done but which I would not like to do, however
great the recompense,

Maybe if I had a wife to drive me on, or children who made
no effort to hide their chagrin that Father was just a teacher in
a state college, I would seek actively after more glamorous things.
But since these family adjuncts are yet to come, if at all, I enjoy
my subject, my associates and my students. Most of the ideas
which I think are perhaps partly original find voice in print when
I am reviewing books which more self-assured people have writ-
ten.

Even the Second World War brought a quiet, unglamorous,
but pleasant three years in this country (most of the time was
spent in Florida) followed by a year or so with the Office of
Military Government in Germany and another year in much the
same capacity as a civilian working with the War Department.
The job was to try to undo as much as possible the damage to
and dislocation of works of art which had been perpetrated by
Nazi-stealing and duress and the horrible destruction of contem-
porary warfare. The experience of driving and tramping around
mounds of sand and brickbats, which were often all that was left
of men’s highest artistic aspirations: for a millennium, has made
me a near-pacifist.

My weakness for the sensuous and the ceremonial, however,
prevents my becoming a Quaker and finds adequate satisfaction
in the Wesley Foundation at the University of Illinois. Metho-
dism had previously always seemed a little too “folksy” and too
little concerned with what seems to be the primal and the ulti-
mate, But apparently there is much variation in the tenor of the

[ 874 ]

thinking and activities of the many churches of this particular
branch of Christianity.

In politics, my complacent fence-straddling, ticket-splitting
attitude has recently been revised. As long as the ballot remains
secret, I plan to be a staunch Republican at the primaries.

There has been no change, however, in what I find the most
satisfying hobby [ll ever have. My early infatuation with grow-
ing pretty but strictly non-utilitarian things was somewhat
meagerly sustained during my undergraduate and graduate days
by the shows and publications of the Massachusetts Horticultural
Society. Now, however, ferociously armed roses climb twenty
feet or more and dispute possession of the driveway with who-
ever dares to venture in. Most of the spare cash which is not
recklessly employed making the roses still more formidable finds
its way to the American Friends Service Committee.

These European trips have led to a good deal of participation
in the radio work of the Department, in informal programs de-
sioned to tell Hoosiers something about how people live in other
countries. Back in 1933, I never expected to be a radio performer

— but as the little red schoolhouse has grown up it has also spread
out.

For the major lines of all this, as I look back, I feel satisfaction
and gratitude: gratitude toward my parents who seconded with
their interest and counsel the course I chose; toward Harvard as
a school giving access to the experience of the past and guidance

in seeking a path into the future; and toward my wife for being
a part of it all.

WHEN I'm eighty, or if before then I’m obliged to hire a psy-
chiatrist, I'll bare my soul, but 1 won’t do it now while still a
gay kid.

What intrigues me about the last twenty-five years, however,

is the remarkable balance good and bad fortune seem to provide.
There was the major bad fortune, for example, of being told

when entering Harvard in 1929 (by a poet, I think) that they
[ 878 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

did not teach such a mundane subject as journalism there and if
I wanted to be a journalist I should major in English — advice I
was stupid enough to follow. And to this day I become apoplec-
tic at the sight of a couplet. But that bad fortune was balanced
five years after graduation — while stumbling from job to job —
by the discovery that I really could get excited about history
and political science and wanted to teach and write them —
activities ’'ve been enjoying in a modest way ever since.

Then there was the vast error of not getting a doctorate be-
fore I got a family —an error that made professional advance-
ment virtually nil. But that was balanced by the good fortune
of acquiring a truly delightful family, by which I mean a wife
and three children who have made me feel joyous far more often
than they have miade me feel like wringing their necks.

And so I could go on with examples of compensations. But
to shorten a long and dull tale, in 1955 the heavens opened and
I was enabled to go get a doctorate after all; and never have we
had such a rich and wonderful two years as we spent in Chapel
Hill, North Carolina. Hereafter, a year away every five years
will be part of our program. Being rooted out of an old rut was
stimulating beyond our best hope. The only disadvantage was
that it began the disintegration of the family; for Peter, our six-
teen-year-old, stayed there to finish high school — and probably
college. Fortunately, Caroline and Franklin holler, quarrel and
rant enough to keep the house from getting dull.

Our travels and hobbies are still limited largely to camping
trips — our latest near Hyde Park, New York, where I worked
on my dissertation in the Roosevelt Library.

Politically, I long ago deserted my Republican heritage and
became a dyed-in-the-wool Democrat. Perhaps living in Georgia
had something to do with it. But I like to believe the greater
warm-heartedness of the Democratic Party was more responsi-
ble. Moderately liberal is the way I would categorize myself,
however; and I’m more convinced than ever that all extremists

should be made college professors so they'll be where we can get
their ideas without being in a position to damage anything. They
should never be allowed in any position of power. Apropos the
great issue of racial integration, ] had the misfortune of being

Association of University Professors during 1954-55 and of hav-
ing to combat, with little success, restrictive state legislation aimed

Religiously, I’m non-church and unorthodox i in my views; but
I'm enough of a Methodist by marriage for the Preacher to mis-
take me for one of the flock.

Ambitions: All modest! All I hope to do is write a little book
like Machiavelli's Prince, send to Harvard a check big enough
to sign without a sense of shame, spend a year abroad very short-
ly and stay alive until I’m eighty-five.

AFTER graduation I spent an idyllic summer as a guide at Lost
River, New Hampshire. When not showing tourists through the
caves, I worked on and completed a correspondence course in
embryology, and in the autumn entered medical school at the
University of Chicago. My father died that fall, and through
the years that followed I owed much to Mother for her support

[ 880 ]

and patient encouragement. In medical school I joined Nu

Sigma Nu and in my senior year was elected to Alpha Omega

Alpha, graduating in the spring of 1937. After a year as intern in

surgery at the University of Chicago Clinics and a stint as volun-

tary assistant in pathology at the University of Rochester I in-

terned in medicine at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, then took a

residency in contagious diseases at Sydenham Hospital in Balti-

more, and an assistant residency in’ medicine at Vanderbilt Uni-
versity Hospital, When the war came, I was’ instructor in pre-
ventive medicine and public health at Vanderbilt, and left to go
with the Vanderbilt Unit (300th General Hospital) when i it was

activated by the Army in July, 1942,

The 300th kept me through Camp Forrest, Tennessee, North
Africa and a year and a half in Naples. After V-E Day I was
transferred to the g4th Evacuation Hospital, scheduled for re-
deployment to Manila. We were crossing the Atlantic when
the war ended, and disembarked at Newport News. ‘The bach-
elors among us were punished for our sins (and lack of points)
by exile to Camp Chaffee, Arkansas, where we examined thou-
sands of men who were being separated from the service.

After the war I spent a few months in practice in Washing-

ton before taking an administrative position in the Division of
Medical Sciences, National Research Council. In 1948 the love
of teaching got the better of me, and I left to become assistant
professor of bacteriology at Emory University School of Medi-
cine, in Atlanta, but returned in 1951 to my former position in
Washington, having learned many things. Among them the most
important is that accounts of the charm and beauty of the ladies
of the City of the Peachtrees are not exaggerated. Be there yet
among us a bachelor, recalcitrant as I was, may his jaded eye
fall upon these lines, not to awaken a spirit of hope, but one of
professional curiosity. If he could resist unscathed those southern
belles, he would indeed be worthy of the highest rank in im-
pervious Bachelordom! This is The Test, w hich I am happy to
say I failed!

In 1952 I entered practice of internal medicine in Washington,
and in 1954 moved my office to Alexandria. It is a smaller com-
munity, where one has a greater sense of “belonging.” Our
three children have been born since we have been living here,

and we have built our home not far from Mount Vernon, on
land which was once a part of George Mason's estate. There is
lots of work to be done. Virginia, too, has social problems, and
we will have to face them. It is not our lot to sit and criticize,
Nothing about this is easy, but one has to have faith that in the
end good will and long, hard thinking will win an acceptable
adjustment to the changes which are occurring. The rapidity
with which these changes have been forced has, many feel, ag-
gravated for the time the problems which they were intended
to solve.

There are fish to be caught in streams, river, bay and sea near
by, and lots of fine companions, Our church is the Old Presby-
terian Meeting House of Alexandria. It is a good place to live.

SOME twenty-five years ago just after graduation, I had one
foot almost poised on a ship’s gangplank ready for a “round

from the Harvard Gold Coast Band. This was not to be. The
male counterpart of dame fortune, in the form of my father,
redirected my foot to a train headed South, with an assignment
to solve some kind of personnel problem in one of the then six
specialty shops operated as a family venture. Some several
thousand personnel problems later 1 now find myself director of
this organization still wondering if it will ever be possible to
predict the buying habits of the perennially unpredictable female.

The only break in my business career was a tour of duty from
1942 to 1946 with the Army Transportation Corps, This kept me

AFTER graduation I headed for New York City where I spent
three good years at Union Theological Seminary, and the sub-
sequent five years in student religious work at Columbia Univer-
sity. During these years, I was married, our children were born,
and we entered the ministry in the Episcopal Church. I was for-
tunate, since I had neither been reared in the Episcopal Church
nor attended a church seminary, in being able to take some time
from duties at Columbia for various courses at the General Theo-
logical Seminary in New York. There in addition to becoming
somewhat more fully acquainted with the ways and thought of

[ 883 ]

Hee eR RENE... renter ans
eens oe

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

my chosen denomination, I also began an acquaintance with the
Ante-Nicene Fathers, a field I hope some day to find more lei-
sure to study.

In 1941, just before the outbreak of hostilities at Pearl Har-
bor, we voluntarily rusticated ourselves to the small community
of Millington and the Missions of All Saints’, No war service,
but a variety of odd jobs in addition to the ministry: Fire Com-
pany and First Aid Squad, teaching as a substitute in the Junior
High, assistant rural mail carrier, plane spotter on the two to four
shift in the mornings.

The war over, a great many other families decided upon Mil-
lington and the surrounding area as a retreat from city life. The
Mission became fully self-supporting and achieved parish status
in 1949. In 1952 we added a parish house to accommodate our
growing church school and other parish activities. A year or
so later, we undertook the running of a day nursery and kinder-
garten, which under a capable director has proved most success-
ful. We have just completed an addition to the church itself,
nearly tripling its former seating capacity, and adding an under-
croft to accommodate Classes from the still expanding church
school.

As time goes by, I wonder more and more at the people who
regard the ministry as a life of “sacrifice.” I can think of no
more deeply satisfying experience than the privilege of entering
into both the joys and sorrows of so many families. I am con-
tinually being amazed both by the real fortitude, even saintliness,
with which some bear misfortune, and by the abject despair of
others over trifling disappointments. More and more I come to
appreciate the meaning of the Christian Gospel and the role
which faith can play in life.

It has been, on the whole, a very happy life and a very busy
life. Our son, who may have shown poor judgment in electing
Dartmouth in preference to Harvard, has shown excellent judg-
ment in his choice of a wife. He is currently serving in the USS.
Army. Our daughter was similarly fortunate in her choice of a
husband, patient and understanding. I suppose that it might have
been hoped that some of their father’s good judgment in the
choice of a mate would pass on to them.

From the standpoint of attendance at Reunions and activities

[ 884 ]

in alumni circles, I have proved a poor member of the Class of
*33. I am, however, forever grateful for the years spent at Har-
vard and for the heritage passed on by the men under whom I
studied.

THE St. Louis chapter in my life, a long and happy one, came
to a close in May, 1955. My wife and I had fele that we were
settled in the genial city for the rest of our days. I had, in fact,
spent nearly twenty years in the Midwest when out of the blue
in July, 1954, came the invitation to become director of the
Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. I had nearly a year to wind up
my affairs as director of the City Art Museum of St. Louis, and
prepare myself for the major challenge of my life. While it was

[ 885 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

hard to separate ourselves from the community and the museum
we loved so much, I have never regretted the decision. My prin-
cipal misgiving was the thought that increased administrative
responsibilities would prevent my direct involvement with art.
Such, happily, has not proven to be the case.

The compensations for a museum director’s headaches — the
prosaic every day problems of fund raising and keeping a tight
roof — are the stimulation of mounting important exhibitions and
the joy of making acquisitions of great works of art. Here the
museum man is lucky indeed for he has the opportunity of exer-
cising his personal taste and judgment through works that often
rank among man’s greatest achievements. In St. Louis, it was
my privilege to recommend the purchases of masterworks by
Rembrandt, Hals, Holbein and Zurbaran and to guide the acqui-
sitions of several private collectors. Boston has offered larger
opportunities. Since my incumbency we have acquired two of
Rembrandt's greatest early portraits, a famous Monet, Gauguin’s
finest sculpture, and we have staged a Sargent commemorative
show and the finest exhibition of modern art to be organized
by the Boston Museum. But I mention these personal satisfac-
tions with humility realizing more and more the magnitude of
the achievements of former directors and the trustees who have
created this great institution. It is a source of constant inspiration.

In 1954, I edited Westward the Way, an anthology of the lit-
erature and the pictorial record of the Louisiana Territory in
the nineteenth century which was published to accompany an
exhibition of the same name.

In June and July, 1957, as a guest of the Federal Republic of
Germany, I spent four weeks traveling through that recon-
structed country visiting with artists, scholars and administrators
and studying new art museums, and old ones rebuilt from the
ruins of war.

I have become a trustee of the Cambridge Drama Festival,
and a vestryman of Christ Church, I remain a councilor of the
American Association of Museums and the Harvard Foundation
for Advanced Study and Research. I have been elected to the
American Academy of Arts & Sciences, to the Massachusetts
Historical Society and the Colonial Society of Massachusetts.

NOW this job has to be done. The well-organized follow-up sys-
tem has taken its final step, and I sit here ready to write with no
further chance for procrastination.

I have mostly good things to say about the twenty-five years.
First there was the year in Austria as a sort of student factory
worker with all the fun and excitement that a young, unattached
and completely green college graduate could have in that at-
tractive and friendly country. Classmate John Taylor even had
me on the Boston Globe payroll for a day covering the Socialist
Uprising of 1934.

Then came consequent years at different sylvan spots in this
country where I gradually grew up in the service of the Diamond
Match Company. Here there was plently of chance to shoulder
responsibility, and any periods of frustration were short and en-
durable.

The Army did more for me than I did for it by creating the
time and place for Classmate Kirkbride to introduce me to Cyn-
thia Woodward, and I had no desire to be unattached any more.
I did have to go to the E.T.O. for a couple of years, where I had
“cloak and dagger” training with O.S.S, (but no C and D ac-
tion). Then home with the world at peace and a wedding day
in Baltimore with old friends checking back in from all over.

[ 887 J

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

Finally, in 1952, I left my old employer, the Diamond Match
Company, in search of smaller pools where the frog makes what
looks like bigger splashes. This is great fun, but naturally also
has some drawbacks. My attitude fluctuates exactly with incom-
ing orders. The little company I manage makes wooden pallets
and other industrial materials handling equipment.

Jonathan and Molly, our children, are very loyal Harvard
holdouts in this solid Eli bailiwick. My political, social, and
economic beliefs and my hobbies are not yet sufficiently de-
veloped to be put down on paper. I do, however, believe very
deeply that in the struggle for survival of the Western World
Harvard can be expected to play a leading role.

GRADUATING with an A.B. in Classics, | soon found out after
teaching for a year that I had majored in the wrong field. Teach-
ing held no appeal so I returned to my small home town. I tried
my hand at several types of labor inchiding bookkeeping and
floral art and finally radio, T.V. and electrical components, am
now in my twentieth year with the company and manage to
make a respectable living for myself and my wife and two sons
in spite of not being a company executive.

As for my political convictions, they still are Republican, al-
though I am beginning to have some misgivings. My travels
have been limited to what one could cover comfortably in a two
or three-week vacation period. Accordingly my perspective
hasn’t broadened appreciably’ since my college days. As for
religion, ’m still a Protestant by birth, a Baptist by choice, and

[ 888 ]

although I’m not a regular attendant myself, I see to it that my
children are.

And finally my social activities, though not too varied, are
adequate for an elderly gentleman of forty-five. Bowling, square
dancing and fishing furnish me plenty of exercise. A good play
or movie plus interesting fiction still give me enjoyment and,
most of all, meetings with family and a splendid group of friends
made over the years make life really worth living. .

In conclusion, although as yet I have not utilized my Harvard
degree for its intended purpose, I have always been thankful for
the four years of college life that made it possible.

IN attempting at this time to expand somewhat on the pretty
well condensed biographic material submitted for previous re-
ports, I could write about some of the many instances of help-
ful encouragement provided by my wife with whom I am (still)
much in love. “Ha!” she says but [ don’t think she means it. I
could also go on about our lovely daughter even though she
does claim at times that I am “just jealous” of such personages
as Pat Boone et al. However, I am sure this is not an unusual
situation. Suffice it to say I hope others are domestically as

happy.

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

We attend the Presbyterian Church, are independent politi-
cally but normally vote Republican, sporadically collect U.S.
stamps (all of us), German steins (I), British lead toy soldiers
and anything in the way of making housekeeping more of a
joy (Laura), and long playing records, perhaps a little heavy
on the popular side (Susan-supra). We travel rarely, although
on occasions get to New York, Chicago, Washington, etc. —
mostly in connection with my work.

As to this work, career that is, except for interludes during
1933-35 in C.W.A., and W.P.A. offices, all of it has been in the
field of traffic and transportation — with the Pennsylvania Rail-
road from 1935 to 1950 and since then with Pittsburgh Coke &
Chemical Company and its Plant Railway, the Pittsburgh & Ohio
Valley of which I was president for about two years. This 1s
not a very long line but of course it is as wide as others. I re-
signed the presidency because personal proximity to actual
operations was often involved and a condition affecting vision
in one eye made that hazardous. Fortunately, the condition does
not hamper my present activities.

The word “traffic” is frequently associated only with whistle
blowing, directional devices and long lines of autos, trucks and
buses. I have had calls seeking advice on such matters as regain-
ing possession of impounded automobiles and allegedly unjust
parking ticket awards. For these reasons alone perhaps there
should be a word in the language more nearly descriptive of
traffic as used in the term “industrial trafic management.” Along
these lines, it has been suggested that “Transport Control Man-
ager” is a title more appropriate than the traditional ‘Traffic
Manager.” In any event, I am on company records as the latter

and, while I do not ordinarily blow a whistle, accomplishments
of our department are important enough, we are told, to justify
a little “horn-tooting” now and then.

More seriously, traffic management is said to be at the hub of
a business; it is the prime function of industrial traffic people to
provide for efficient transportation, to control the cost of it and
to furnish a variety of services pertinent to those ends. These
people believe their endeavors are coming to be recognized as a
profession. One statistic, of interest I think, and I am done —

AFTER graduating from college, I attended the Harvard Law
School, graduating in 1936. While there I was fortunate in be-
ing elected an editor of the Harvard Law Review. After gradu-
ation I became associated with my present law firm and became
a member of the firm on January 1, 1942. My only infidelity
to the law since has been the period spent in military service
from early 1941 until the end of 1945. I entered the Army as a
reserve second lieutenant and was discharged with the rank of
lieutenant colonel. Most of my active duty was in Washington
in Headquarters of the Army Service Forces. I learned my way
around the Pentagon and solved many of its other mysteries.

My law practice consists primarily in acting as counselor and
adviser to business organizations and individuals. The variety of
business problems that I deal with still continues to exercise a
great fascination for me. Although the law is a jealous mistress,
I find the time to engage in various civic and philanthropic ac-_
tivities which provide me an equal measure of gratification. My
hobbies are reading, golf and bridge, and I have acquired a
modest collection of modern art. I do not take a vacation every
year since I prefer to accumulate my time for more ambitious
trips, which in recent years included three visits to Europe.

Politically, I have made a small contribution to the effort of
the Republican Party to establish a two-party system in the
State of Georgia.

it took all of my legal prowess to woo and win her in 1939. We

AFTER leaving school in 1930 I spent an unhappy year on Wall
Street, from which I was rescued by being fired, a not unusual
occurrence at that time, just a few months after the 1929 crash.
From that time to the present, with time out for three years in
the Army, I have been in the textile business. In March, 1943,
I received my “greetings” from the Army. Because of my
knowledge of German and French, I was put into Psychological
Warfare, where I had an interesting war in ETO.

My hobbies, not necessarily in the right order, are golf, bridge
and music (Beethoven, not Presley).

AFTER finishing at Harvard I commenced working, in Septem-
ber, 1934, with my father’s law firm while at the same time
studying at St. John’s Law School. I have remained with that
firm, progressing from clerk to associate to partner. For a short
time it appeared that the tenor of my life as a lawyer would be
disturbed by the Navy when I received “Greetings” from my
draft board, but that was not to be, for it was decided that per-
sons such as I, over twenty-eight, would be detrimental to the
war effort, ;

In November, 1937, I was married and have lived happily a
normally unpredictable married life. Joe, our oldest, is a sopho-
more at St. Michael’s College in Vermont. Sarah Jane is a senior
in St. Agnes Academic School in Rockville Centre and Connie
is in the eighth grade in the parochial school. They both gradu-
ate in June and will probably miss the Reunion because of exam-
inations.

As for me, I golf a little and indulge in archery, in the periods
when I am not struggling to keep the lawn mowed and the
flower beds free from weeds.

occupPaTION: Partner, H. G. Reisner Bookstore.

SINCE 1933 and before I’ve worked in the H.G. Reisner Book-
store. Come 1958 my Dad will have been in this business fifty
years, and I shall have been associated with same for twenty-five
years. My only reprieve was from 1950 to 1956 when my resi-
dence was in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Even then I commuted
and spent at least six months of the year here in West Lafayette.
The fact that we serve Purdue University and are closely asso-
ciated with this institution has given me a second love and a
prolonged college life.

Virginia and I have just built a new home. We expect now
to be in the book business another twenty-five years. My daugh-
ter, Ann, who is a freshman in West Lafayette High School,
keeps us hopping taking her to out-of-town athletic contests.
My son, “Trey,” shows promise of being a great quarterback —
but of course that is several years off.

Our only hobby is bridge. In Florida we were introduced to
duplicate bridge and now we make as many tournaments as we
can. That doesn’t add up to too many as the bookstore business
is very confining — especially when you are open seven days
a week. We see our share of Purdue football and basketball
games and enjoy the college atmosphere. In spite of hard work
I still weigh 210— Virginia is too good a cook! Guess that
brings you up to date on the Reisners.

leg injury made me unacceptable to the armed forces, so 1 spent
the war years engaged in defense work in shipyards in Portland

and Ellsworth, Maine.
The surveying experiences, with my Harvard studies, enabled

me to take a position with the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads in
the Bar Harbor, Maine, office and for the past several years 1
have found contentment and moderate success in aiding with the
design and construction of the scenic highways of Acadia Na-
tional Park and in the National Forests of New England. The
recent closing of this Bar Harbor office gave me the choice of
transferring to Washington, D. C., or looking for other em-
ployment, so I have accepted a position with the Maine State
Highway Commission in the Ellsworth office. I prefer to bring
up my family and to spend my life in the more peaceful environ-
ment of a small town, and I hope to make my contribution to
the improvement of the highway system which will entice the

In June, 1936, I married Helen Loweree of Ellsworth, a gradu-

FOR about 170 days of every 365 since graduation, I’ve been
teaching school, and I’ve never found it dull. Whether my stu-
dents may have found it so is no part of this biography. In 1933
I started full of enthusiasm for progressive education. By 1943
I had veered to a more staid view, and now I am educationally
in the conservative camp and very happy to find the country at
large coming along in the same direction. I have taught in the
East, West, Middle West and in England, all levels from sixth
grade to twelfth and all subjects except cooking and Spanish.
I believe in public schools and private schools, day schools and
boarding schools, boys’ schools, girls’ schools and coeducation.
Most of all I believe in good schools.

Four years ago the growing cost of raising a growing family
forced me to look for a promotion. I shied away from a private
school headmastership because I felt that the financial responsi-
bility and the pressure of enrollment problems would take me
too far from the classroom. After a complete change of scenery
teaching in English public schools, I taught for two years in the
public schools in Lincoln, Massachusetts, while getting my Mas-

ter of Education degree at Harvard. Last year I was appointed
principal of an elementary and junior high school in Dover,
Massachusetts, where I find the work very congenial.

I married a girl ten years my junior three days after she gradu-
ated from Radcliffe. Thus I have been able to maintain almost
fifty percent control of what goes on at home. We have four
children, who are easy to live with and sometimes quite enter-
taining.

Summer vacations we usually spend on our island in Penob-
scot Bay — Beach Island if you’re coming by. We say we like
to get away from it all, but when we’ve accomplished that, we
love to have visitors.

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

LEFT Harvard the end of my junior year to go to work for
Laclede Steel Company of St. Louis, Missouri, and have just
completed twenty-five years with this company. My first job
was “third helper” in the open hearth department at thirty-six
cents an hour and was happy when I could make twenty dollars
a week. Worked in most of the operating departments of the
company and then into the district sales office of the company at
Chicago in 1935. Returned to St. Louis in the executive depart-
ment of the company in 1939. Became assistant vice-president
in 1942 and vice-president and secretary in 1944; also in 1944,
president, Southern States Steel Corporation and Laclede Tube
Company, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Laclede Steel Company.

I was married in 1933 to Sara Benoist of St. Louis. Our two
eldest daughters are married and our youngest daughter, age
eleven, and grandchildren, ages one and three, keep us young
in mind and spirit if not in body. Over the years I have had
a lot of fun causing turmoil in the various health, welfare and
character building agencies in the St. Louis area and in draining
the coffers of long-suffering friends for the benefit of the St.
Louis Symphony Orchestra and similar perennially destitute or-
ganizations.

I had the good fortune to go on the Administrative Board of
Control of the St. Louis City Art Museum while our classmate,
Perry Rathbone, was still director of the museum. St. Louis
owes so much to Perry, for while our museum was and is a great
museum Perry had the knack of catching the fancy of all the
people of our community and not only brought more and more
of them through the entrance doors but through his “Friends
of the Art Museum” drained the pockets once he had a chance
to show them his wares. The Boston museum is most fortunate
in its acquisition of the one and only genuine Rathbone.

In conclusion I can still waddle through a doubles match on
the tennis courts charging the net like a bull elephant, frighten-
ing the children in the swimming pool half a furlong away. I don’t
know why I take any pride in the above but I assume that my
intention is to show that while dry rot has descended a long
way it hasn’t reached my feet yet.

ACTUALLY, I’m a member of the Class of 1933 only because
of the “occidental” system at Harvard. I started with the Class,
but at the middle of our second year I decided to write the Great
American Novel. I suppose my reasoning might have been some-
thing like, “Eugene O'Neill, or Edgar Allan Poe, or Sinclair
Lewis — why not Richard Rigg!” I say “might have been,” be-
cause, frankly, I can’t remember much about those days. It all
seemed a little silly to be wasting my time taking things in, when
it would have been so much better for the world for me to be
giving out the long-awaited masterpiece. Ah, the egoism and
egotism of youth! So I quit.

For the next several years I did everything, almost, except
write the Great American Novel. From short-order cook to in-

[ 904 ]

creasing ur th henge OARS T CRATE LET A  T,

surance salesman, actor to mechanic, sea-hand to travel agent,

finally to teaching school. At that point I met, 1 wooed, I mar-

ried, the girl. ‘hat was the luckiest and best thing that ever

happened to me. After one year we decided I really ought to

go back and finish my formal education. That, gentlemen, took

some doing. I quit in February, 1931, I went back in Septem-

ber, 1939. I claim the record for the Class in graduating last:

February, 1942 (Occ 1933!). Without making too much of it,

for this is a biography for classmates to read, I want to state for

the record that it could never have been done without the in-

spiration, yes, and the intestinal fortitude of my wife.

So, I went back; changed my field from English to engineer-
ing, and finally, just after Pearl Harbor, graduated. The
O.N.O.P. convinced me I should get a job in industry rather
than in the Navy, so I went to work at Stromberg-Carlson in
Rochester. My boss was Chuck Angle, ’33 (Q.V.), and we got
along fine until he went into the Marines. I quit and went into
the Navy, spending a boring year at BuShips, and an only slightly
less boring year as first lieutenant on a jeep carrier in the Pacific
(we never fired a shot in anger).

After the late unpleasantness, I started as a sales engineer in
he industrial sales department of Corning Glass Works. Some-
vhere along the way we began the process of raising three chil-
‘ren, which, like my education, came later than usual. Then, in
954, a chance came to change to my present company and now

have the glorified title of vice-president, marketing. Being a
Dig frog in a little puddle” is very satisfying; I must do some-
ing of everything and there is never a dull t moment. Advertis-

o, “market research, sales service and engineering, and best of
— peddling.

I’m a Republican, when I think of such things, an avid gar-
ner, reader (whodunits especially), tinkerer, stamp collector
1 loafer. I never have enough money, or time. Oh, yes, I have
1 to write the Great American Novel.

MY professional life started at Harvard Medical School, which
I found difficult and dull after the exciting and somewhat re- —
Jaxed intellectual climate of Harvard College. However, the
economic squeeze of the mid-thirties saved the situation. A fel-
lowship required special work, so I started in on airborne infec-
tion with William F.. Wells at the School of Public Health. The

work proved fascinating and Jed, more than twenty years later,
to a reorientation of my scientific efforts,

But first came years of work in respiratory physiology, en-
tered into largely because the Chest Service at Bellevue Hospital
seemed a reasonable place to await a call by the Navy. When the
call was delayed, respiratory physiology provided a logical move,
especially since Dickinson W. Richards and André Cournand
were beginning some interesting work with a catheter introduced
through a vein into the heart. So in their laboratory I saw first

hand a Nobel Prize in the making and also acquired a first-class
wife.

Then came three and a half years in the Navy, all on dry land
and mostly in association with one of the most brilliant and de-
lightful men I have known, the late Dr. Joseph L. Lihenthal. We
worked together on practical problems in aviation medicine and
on basic respiratory physiology. Though very different in per-

sonality, we clicked as a team. After the war Joe went to Hop-
kins as professor of environmental medicine and a few years later
[ joined the department at his invitation.

In the interim I went back to the Cardio-Pulmonary Labora-
ory at Bellevue, carrying with me ideas and techniques learned
n Pensacola. In the stimulating atmosphere of this laboratory
vhere the cardiac catheter was exposing hitherto hidden secrets
f the pulmonary circulation, ideas and experiments were pro-
ressing apace until, one cold December day, my chest X-ray
10wed tuberculosis. The few months of bed rest which ensued
rovided a timely opportunity to develop some physiologic
cory which up to that time had remained incomplete. The ill-
ss also provided both time and stimulus for philosophic con-

[ 907 ]

templation. It even provided an excuse for a leisurely convales-
cence in Italy.

A few months later, in 1950, came the move from New York
to Baltimore. For the first time we had a house of our own with
magnificent trees and a garden. At Johns Hopkins Hospital we
built a laboratory for the study of respiratory physiology to
which men from many different parts of the world come on re-
search fellowships.

Two years ago my wife and I reciprocated by going to Delhi,
India, to help set up a laboratory. We arrived with Bulganin
and Khrushchev and left just before the arrival of Dulles. While
the newspapers screamed against the United States, we were ac-
corded courtesy and respect and affection. We learned that
working together in politically insensitive areas such as medicine
provides a favorable basis for human contacts of inestimable
value,

On returning to Baltimore, a tentative re-association with that
old master of airborne infection, Professor Wells, became a firm
alliance. My wife, herself a Hopkins M.D., has now joined us
in studying mechanisms involved in the spread of respiratory
infections through the air. With sparks to light the way from
the fantastic mind of a genius who has always been too far ahead
of his time, we look forward to years of spirited activity in the
cause of air hygiene.

My life has been illuminated by close and continuous asso-
ciation with men and women of imagination, integrity and in-
sight. One, Miss Lillian M. Paige, taught music to several of us

in the Class of ’33. Without exception these people have been
liberals and humanists.

LOOKING backwards brings certain scenes to mind that stand
out more now than they did ten years ago. Such might be the
mad gaiety of the crowd in Times Square on V-J night, the
shock of the headlines announcing the atomic age.

Personal highlights include a leisurely auto trip from New
York to Baton Rouge, including the Shenandoah Skyline Drive;
then to Des Moines and back across the wheatlands to New
York. This gave a marvelous picture of the size, variety and
wealth of the country to a born-and-raised Easterner.

A quick trip to Europe, visiting England, France and Ger-
many in 1954 gave a rich taste of British hospitality and the
charm and excitement not only of London but some of the coun-
try. In France, most of my favorable impressions were from
the Louvre. Germany seemed to be a nation that works so ef-
ficiently as to make it look easy. A bottle of wine appears
around eleven instead of a coffee break. A whole city (Bremen),
though rebuilt since the war, succeeds in looking almost like
parts of Cambridge.

The privilege of working in New York City seems to be
grossly underrated. Walking up Fifth Avenue, certainly the
greatest street in one of the greatest cities of the world, and see-
ing the great group of buildings around Rockefeller Center
ought to be, and is, vastly stimulating. With this, I live in Rye
and while it is admittedly a form of substitution (for a Harvard
and Red Sox fan), I revel in Rye High School’s football record
of thirty-three wins out of the last thirty-five.

To be a bit philosophical, it seems to me this is an age when
beliefs are becoming more important. The challenge of dictator-
ship seers to have spurred activity in all the churches in my
community. Most are adding buildings and are filled to near ca-
pacity every week. Living what one believes is splendid but
what amazes me is the lack of articulateness (or is it lack of
thought?) on today’s problems, local as well as world, by those
whom I meet. As a believer in liberty, I refuse to agree with the

political leaders and writers who claim “they” can spend about
a third of our incomes for our benefit more efficiently than we
can. Nor can I understand why so many of my fellows allow
such claims to go unchallenged.

Looking forward: I didn’t think it would be possible for our
children to face a more topsy-turvy world than we did in 1933
but they well may. Yet from what I see of them I feel sure they

will be able to take care of things as well as we have, perhaps
better.

IN 1933, shortly before graduation, when I got the usual treat-
ment on vocational guidance, my adviser suggested “gentleman
farmer.” At the time this idea struck me as completely fantastic,
but actually he very nearly hit the nail on the head. For al-
though I don’t actually do any farming I live on a farm, and in
a way enjoy its assets without its headaches.

Since I left the Air Corps for civilian life in 1945, I have been
living in the country and frankly wouldn’t be caught dead in
the city. I love the availability of all my favorite sports: skiing
in the winter, fishing in the summer, hunting in the fall, and
hiking all year. My favorite hobby is picture-taking, and I find
endless opportunity to indulge in that here. And lastly, my
store is a constant source of interest, not to say amusement, as
well as occasionally a monetary asset. I say occasionally because
in the fall when the summer people leave 1 wonder why I don’t
close it up for the winter. On the other hand, in the spring when

the summer people come back I wonder why I have to work so
hard.

Nothing very profound about my life, but nature to me means

Like most of the rest of us, I moved from school into a world
without much economic use for me, so I took the first job I
could get, which was on a newspaper, and I have been in journal-

year writing editorials for The New Yorker; seven years writing
various departments for Time magazine, one year writing for

AT present I am quite busily engaged in cost accounting at the
General Electric Company in Everett. Here are manufactured
J-79 jet engine parts and assemblies for the GE jet engine center
at Evendale, Ohio. We try hard to steer our way through the
maze of CPFF and target incentive contracts. Cost recovery and
attempts to satisfy the Air Force auditors that we are barely
making a reasonable profit keep us quite busy.

At the time Local Board No. 9 requested my services, I had
been working for the U.S. Engineer Office in Boston. I spent three
years in the Air Force, December, 1942, through November,
1945, including ten months in England where I was stationed
at Base Air Depot No. 1 in Warrington, Lancashire. The service
was quite an experience, but I was quite happy to be discharged.

A civilian again, I became a registration officer with the Bos-
ton Regional Office of the Veterans Administration where our —
principal problem was the administration of the G.I. Bill. Dur-
ing this time I managed to complete some six courses in ac-
counting and business administration at Northeastern Evening
School. Thus, in 1948, thanks to a lead from a classmate, I went
to work for the General Electric Company, as a cost accountant
in the Aircraft Gas Turbine Division at the River Works in
Lynn. In 1953 I had an opportunity to go to Everett as a super-
visor and have been here ever since. I enjoy my work and have
found a great deal of satisfaction in it.

AS you can see from the above, there have been few dull mo-
ments since I got out of the Business School in 1935. On the
theory of “learning the business from the ground up,” I worked
seven years in overalls. Finally, my engineering and business
training came to the fore and put me into the white-collar class
where I have managed to remain.

When the wall of our house began to bulge — our sixth was
just beginning to walk—my wife decided that we should all
move to the country. We live in a big, old farm house on a dirt
road with the woods all around us. Although I was far from
enthusiastic about the project to begin with, I soon discovered
that my wife was right, as usual. Now the shoe is on the other
foot and she complains that it is almost impossible to drag me
away from the place. Having experimented with almost every
variety of livestock, we have ended up with two horses and three
goats in the barn, and three children and three poodles in the
house. Of the three children at home, two go to private school
in Andover and the third is at Rogers Hall in Lowell.

The three older children are more widely scattered. Gail will
graduate this year from Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri,
and Sam from Phillips-Andover. Eleanor is at Chapel Hill. All
in all, the world has been very good to us and we are very happy
in our rural setting.

THE expression tempus fugit certainly is true. It hardly seems
possible that twenty-five years have passed since I graduated.
Many things have changed, but I can happily say that although
I look older, I still feel young and full of energy.

The years of medical school and internship passed quickly.
In 1940, I married a wonderful young lady, Sylvia Denny, whom
I met while still in college. Our daughter, Patricia Diane, was
born in 1942, and our son, Bruce Warren, in 1945. Now, fifteen
and thirteen, our house is never quict what with parties and
rock and roll. My wife and I enjoy dancing and we often have
great times dancing with our children and learning all the lacest
steps. Pat is active as a twirler in the high school band, and she

[918]

can certainly swing that baton, Bruce loves airplanes and mechan-
ical gadgets and his knowledge of those fields is amazing.

The first few years of general practice were entirely devoted
to building up a good reputation and becoming a respected and
well-liked member of my community. Having had a kidney-
stone in 1940, I was automatically rejected by the armed forces
when I tried to enlist. As a result, I remained at home and tried
to do my part in Civil Defense. |

Learning to fly a plane in 1945 was very rewarding. It gave
our family many wonderful experiences and also opened new
fields of endeavor to me. My interest in aviation led me into
the aircraft business. For several years, in addition to practicing
medicine, I developed a thriving business of buying and selling
airplanes and helicopters. When it became too time-consuming
and the opportunity presented itself, I sold it and entered the
hobby-toy field. I introduced the entire line of plastic helicopter
kits which you see being sold today. On the side, I did a little
inventing and now have a few items which are being sold in the
surgical field. Since my dad was always interested and active in

real estate and construction, I also added that to my list of
activities.

Traveling is perhaps our biggest hobby. Since I learned to fly,
our family spends many pleasant hours flying all over the United
States, Canada and Mexico. We all love to fly and are ready to
go anywhere at the slightest suggestion. Beginning in 1948 my
wife and I started to take at least one month every year and see
the world. We have been to every continent and many unusual
places in this vast world of ours. I have taken thousands of
Kodachromes of the places we have been, and it is wonderful
every once in a while to relive those vacations by spending an
evening looking at our slides. Making tape recordings of our
children and friends, listening to Hi-Fi, playing golf, and helping
my children with their homework are some of my other hobbies.

Practising medicine, engaging in my other activities, being very
close to my wife and children, and being very active in the
governmental and social activities of my community have made
the years fly by. I hope and trust that God will watch over us
so that we may all enjoy the next twenty-five years as much as
we have those that have just passed.

IN looking back over the past twenty-five years, I would place
my family first in importance in giving meaning to my life.
Throughout the years we have been a closely knit family — my
wife and I and our two children. With winters in New York
and summers on Long Island, weekends in Millbrook during
the years we have had a place up there — it seems to me we have
spent our lives loading and unloading that station wagon with
family paraphernalia.

The upbringing and education of our children have been an
absorbing interest to Muriel and myself. It is a source of great
satisfaction to both of us how well our children are coming
along. Our daughter Bard is now a sophomore at Radcliffe
where her good academic achievements bear little resemblance
to her father’s record in Cambridge twenty-five years ago. Dick,
our son, is also a good student. He is now fourteen and is show-
ing real qualities of leadership. He is a good athlete, taking after
his mother in this respect. My convictions regarding the value
of creating a climate within the family and school environment,
which allows for individual growth and expression, have been

[ 920 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

borne out as a result of trying to bring up our children. I think

I have been most fortunate in having a professional career that

gives me such a sense of satisfaction. While there are many pro-

fessions about which the same can be said, there is nothing more
rewarding than the sense of achievement in helping others.

Most of the twenty years I have spent in this field, after a brief

career in investment banking, have been related to work with

children — deprived children from broken homes with serious
emotional problems. My first job after graduation from the

New York School of Social Work was with the Community

Service Society of New York, working with boys 17 to 18 years

of age who had run away from home. After that I worked for

several years at Youth House, a detention home for delinquent

boys. F ollowing this experience I supervised a group of social

workers who were trying to rehabilitate families brought to the

attention of the Brooklyn Society for the Prevention of Cruelty

to Children. When the New York City Youth Board started its

delinquency prevention program ten years ago, I joined that or-

ganization in charge of a unit office first in Central Harlem and
later in the Bronx. Five years ago I joined the organization with
which I am presently associated. I am in charge of a volunteer
bureau which recruits volunteers for the more than 200 social
welfare agencies connected with the Federation of Protestant
Welfare Agencies, Inc. I am also finding myself on the way to
becoming an adult educator being responsible in my present job
for conducting training institutes and workshops for the many
thousand board members who direct the agencies connected
with the federation. I suppose one of the important things about
all this experience is that it has afforded a chance for personal
growth and a better understanding of one’s own emotional needs.
With this background I have also been able to make a more ef-
fective contribution as a trustee of a number of schools and wel-
fare organizations.

As for hobbies and travel—my main hobby is photography
and this goes hand and hand with travel. My wife and I both
like to travel. Two years ago we took the whole family to
Europe for a highly successful trip. We talked about it for years
and finally made it before the children were all grown up. This
past summer Muriel and I went by ourselves to Ireland and re-

[921 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

visited some of the spots I had been to with some of the members
of the Class of ’33 back in college days. Almost every Easter
vacation in recent years we have gone as a family to some place
like Bermuda or Nassau. I will always look back to those trips
with particular pleasure. The boxes of colored slides taken on
our travels are piling up and I look forward to many future trips
with my wife in the years ahead when I can photograph some of
the many beautiful spots we have yet to visit. Now that Muriel
has started working for a travel agency I expect to accompany
her on her business trips when I can get away from my ow
job. .
I have not been active in politics as yet but perhaps with my
first hand knowledge of some of the social conditions that cause
delinquency, broken homes, unhappiness and want, I may do
more in this field. Nothing has happened in twenty-five years to
alter my convictions in being a Democrat. It has been encourag-
ing to see what was once termed “New Deal Socialism” ac-
cepted welfare programs in recent Republican election plat-
forms. While I have worked mostly in the voluntary social field,
I am as strongly convinced as ever of the importance of our hav-
ing in this country a sound broad public assistance and social
security system, adequate public housing, health insurance and
better educational facilities.
My only real regret in looking back over the past years is that
I have seen so little of the friends I made in college. Those were
four particularly happy years for me and I hope that between
now and our Fiftieth Anniversary, I shall see a lot more of the
guys who were responsible for making those college years so
pleasant.

ABOUT ten years ago, after some disillusioning experiences in
working for corporations, I came to two conclusions: that I was
absolutely no good at office politics and wanted to get as far
away from it as possible, and that I wanted, towards this end, to
have a business of my own. The result of these conclusions was
my starting my own firm as a manufacturers’ agent late in 1948.

When girl friends of my wife ask her what I do and she tells
them I am a manufacturers’ agent, they mostly look as blank and
uninformed as before. Although this explanation is probably
unnecessary for Harvard men, in case there are some few who
do not know, a manufacturers’ agent acts in a sales capacity for
smaller firms who do not have sufficient volume to employ a
full-time salesman or for larger firms who see the advantages of
a multipleman sales organization over a single salesman. Cur-
rently we represent about a dozen firms in the hardware and
automotive industry. By “we,” J mean my three salesmen and
myself, who cover eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey,
Delaware, Maryland and the District of Columbia, calling on
hardware and automotive jobbers and some mill supply houses,
Our lines include such products as nuts and bolts, wrenches,
spot lights, tool boxes, tacks and nails, washers, chucks, etc. In
all my activities since graduating from the Business School in
1935, I have not found anything as satisfying, as much hard
work, as exciting and varied, as profitable or as all around worth .
while as being a manufacturers’ agent!

To go back a bit, my first job was with Congoleum-Nairn of
Kearny, New Jersey. Later I was with the Wall Rope Works of
New York City in a sales capacity. Then came the war. With
Phil Hoppin and other Business School classmates, I gave up my
job to go down to the War Production Board in Washington
to join the staff of Donald Nelson. Still single, I felt I wanted
to get into war activities further and early in 1942 I volunteered
for the Navy. At first they said my feet were too flat and would

[ 923 ]

have nothing to do with me. (I could never see this — it might
apply to the Army!). However, I got a waiver and, as it were,
got in through the back door. As a result, I found myself in an
office job, rather than out on an aircraft carrier. It was like get-
ing out of Sing Sing, but I made it, and had eighteen wonderful
months at sea as armed guard gunnery officer (lieutenant) on
merchant ships, While in Washington I met the most wonderful
girl in the world and we were married there in July, 1943. Fran-
cesca was then working at the Romanian Legation as private and
social secretary to the Romanian Minister to the United States.
Later, when her country was occupied by the Germans, she was
the only member of the Romanian Legation asked to stay here
by the State Department and handled all the Romanian Govern-
ment’s affairs single-handedly during the war. We have lived in
the beautiful little Quaker town of Moorestown, New Jersey, for
the past ten years, and this is where we hope to spend the rest
of our lives. Here I attend the Christian Science Church, am ac-
tive in the local Rotary Club and in politics as Republican
County Committeeman, as well as serving on the Community
Fund Council.

We trust any classmates who ever pass Exit No. 4 on the New
Jersey Turnpike (they will be one mile from our house), or if
otherwise in the vicinity of Philadelphia, will turn in and pay us
a Visit.

LAST summer at the Berkshire Music Festival, I recognized the
now whitened head of one of my most respected professors,
Walter Piston. I hadn’t seen him in the twenty-four years since
I left the Graduate School. I walked over to congratulate him
on his Sixth Symphony, which had just been performed. Before
I could speak, he said “Hello, Rogers,” without hesitation, “most
of them change, but you look about the same.” This kind of
flattery makes an indelible impression on the middle-aged mind,
and it even had a commendable effect on the young mother of
my eight and ten-year-old sons. I report the incident merely
to prove that the comparative photographs accompanying this
screed constitute an outrageous lie. Of course the camera lies.
I suppose I can even claim the professional right to say so, since
a fraction of the twenty-five years was spent as a photographer
for Time and Life. (Favorite assignments: The Harvard Tercen-
tenary; Gypsy Rose Lee.) How this happened to a music major
(or do we say “concentrator” at Harvard) is even more puzzling
today than it was then. It had something to do with economics
of the decade into which the Class of 1933 found itself thrust.
A member of an earlier Harvard Class had closed the banks,
reopened them, but failed to give me a key. Later, a Yaleman,
Harry Luce, refused to give me a key to the executive washroom,
so in 1938 I talked the Philadelphia Inquirer people into hiring
me to be the editor of their erstwhile national picture magazine,
Click, | was twenty-five at the time and I took my responsibil-
ities quite seriously, especially when it came to the selection of
cheese-cake photographs. These presumably accounted for a

number of years. I may well have made the conversion before
this is printed, since the desires for contemplation, for creative
effort, and for taking more of a hand in the education of my sons
have become of increasing importance to me.

Other than as a broadcaster, I have found some time for
direct participation in music during this all-too-short quarter cen-
tury. My “Sarabande” (revised from Harvard days) and my
“Prelude with Fugue” have been performed in recent years
by the National Symphony Orchestra under Howard Mitchell.
I have been the commentator at special concerts of the National
Symphony and of the Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene
Ormandy. In January, 1957, the Howard University Chorus and
the National Symphony gave the world’s premiere of “The
President’s Prayer,” a setting of the prayer that Eisenhower wrote
for his first Inaugural Address. The audience at the concert in
Constitution Hall included my eminent collaborator and his wife,
the Vice-President and Mrs. Nixon, and the Assistant to the Pres-
ident and Mrs. Adams.

It was through Sherman Adams that I affirmed that art and
politics do mix. As a longtime Republican (who has not always
voted the party ticket), I found the candidacy and election of
Fisenhower welcome even before I knew that it would bring
to Washington the dividend of Adams in the top staff post at
the White House. We came together through our mutual cul-
tural interests, and out of our friendship came CASE, President
Eisenhower’s Committee of Art, Science and Education. This
was organized in 1956. I signed on as executive director, with
Dean Harry Carman (Columbia) and Helen Hayes as co-chair-
men. We were born as the symbol of the President’s interest in
the eggheads, and theirs in him. Our original function was to
dispel the commonly accepted myth that American intellectuals
were a monopoly of the Stevenson wing of the Democratic
Party. It had been my thought that CASE would be retired
after the 1956 election, but its success in recruitment of American
cultural leaders led to its continuation on a modest basis. Pres-
ident Eisenhower has drawn on its members, but certainly not
exclusively on them, for advice in their fields of competence.

Perhaps by virtue of my administrative relationship to them, I,
too, might get their advice. Some of them could explain why

[ 928 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

I had written so much for a publication that does not pay space
rates. (Guilt for not having kept in better touch with my class-
mates.) But can anyone explain why, in June, 1958, I am just
about ready to undertake many of the things I had in mind in
June, 1933? The twenty-five years in between have been active.
Mostly, I have been happy. By some standards I have flourished.
If I have, it is evident that I have flourished in chaos.

In teaching the philosophy of Plato, the late Professor A. N.
Whitehead used to discuss at some length the relationship of man
to the chaos that surrounds him. Although I’ve forgotten ex-
actly what it was that Professor Whitehead tried to teach me,
it appears that the years to come, as have the years gone by, will
furnish chaos adequate for experimental purposes. I shall take
faithful notes and I hope to be able to report the results to you
in time for the Fiftieth Reunion.

MY wife, my son and I are sometimes called “the Three R’s,”
and I suppose that designation is as appropriate as any: all are
in school as teacher or student, all are concerned directly with
reading, ’riting and ’rithmetic, and all three are Romans.

[929 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

Except for three World War II years which I spent in the
American National Red Cross first as an assistant field director
and finally as a service director for eight southern states, I have
worked in the field of education. A recital of my peregrinations
from private schools to junior colleges to public high schools
would make interesting reading only to a personnel manager,
a manifest of the various administrative and teaching jobs I have
held would scarcely have wider appeal. Teaching senior English
classes in Sharon (Massachusetts) High School and carrying
out somewhat nebulous duties as department chairman, I find
myself still enthusiastic about students and subject matter as well
as interested in problems of personnel and curriculum.

Until recent years my wife has been our beautifier of home
and creator of the repast divine. Now, for obvious financial
reasons with a son approaching college entrance, she has returned
to elementary school teaching — strangely enough, in the wing
of the high school building housing both father and son. And
so, the little “triple entente” rides to school each day, allied in
the pursuit of scholarship.

In education, I am both amused and pleased to see the pen-
dulum swinging from the playboy approach to learning back
to a Boston Latin School type of rigidly directed study. Perhaps
this “spaetnik” approach to learning will eventually produce
the “sputniks” we need. |

Progressing to politics, I find little to say of my convictions.
Internationally, I have always had no stomach at all for the fare
served by fascist and communist regimes. Nationally, I am still
a “Republocrat,” choosing individuals, rather than “sides.”

My religious beliefs are those of my college days, and I go
to church regularly on Sundays, Although I have the desire to
travel far and wide over the world, I have limited my vacation
jaunts to the United States and Canada. To date, I have found
Florida most appealing and may some day hang my hat on a
palm tree peg.

MY grandfather had an old maxim which he was fond of quoting.

“It doesn’t matter how many times you change your profession

as long as you do it in good faith and it leads to the right one be-
fore it’s too late.” Looking back over the last twenty-five years,
I can honestly say that I agree with him, although when I was
a boy, it all sounded too odd, for, of course, I thought that I knew
what I wanted to do. It has taken a long time to find the right
profession and it hasn’t been easy. But, by doing so, I have also
oroved to myself a pet theory that we should do in life what we
‘eel we must, in spite of endless good reasons to the contrary.
-erhaps the theories amount to the same thing, but the second
ne if I had followed it would have saved me a great deal of time.

In my college days I wanted to be a landscape architect, but I
vas persuaded against it by well-meaning members of the pro-
ssion who, having ascertained that I had to earn my own liveli-
Dod, put up a foolproof case from the point of view of reason
at, in view of the depression, then very much with us all, I
d better turn my hand to something more practical like archi-
sture. Here was the first mistake about my future profession.
1e argument that in spite of depression, people must have
mes, shops, factories, and, in those days before television, which

w seems so long ago, cinemas, seemed a good one,

[931]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

In the autumn of 1933, I started my architectural career at
Princeton. It was to be short-lived — not as cynics and the most
loyal Harvard Alumni will say because I chose the wrong uni-
versity, but because my real interest was in landscape gardening
with emphasis on the gardening. By the end of my first year
at Princeton, I had an “elegant sufficiency,” if I may borrow a
phrase from another era. This was not surprising, even as a
child I had spent my allowance on bulbs and seed packets and
shown little inclination toward bricks and mortar.

The autumn of 1935 found me teaching English and Latin at
the Buckley School for Boys in New York City. It was a pleasant
life for a bachelor as New York offered opera, theatre and art
galleries which I enjoyed. Weekends I gardened at my parents’
home in New Jersey. In summers I traveled, often by tutoring
in various parts of the country and even tutoring two boys
blessed with family yachts which took us to many parts of
Europe.

With the war the pattern changed. When I left Buckley to
take up my commission as an ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve,
I knew that I would not return to teaching. My duty was
varied, partly behind a desk at Navy Headquarters at go Church
Street, partly afloat in landing crafts including the invasion of
Normandy and finally intelligence work in London. On my ar-
rival in England, I dug myself in as I had visited there before the
war and there were both familiar places and faces.

When I returned home and was discharged from the Navy, I
was at once asked if 1 would return to London to open an office
for the Rheem Manufacturing Company. After a year devoted
to the problems of steel, oil drums and heating appliances, I
realized that “big business” was not for me.

In 1948, after some months at home, I returned to England to
train at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The cycle had been
completed and I was turning back to my first interest. More
training at the Edinburgh Botanic Gardens followed. Mean-
while I made it a point to visit as many of the important gardens
in the British Isles as possible and also those on the Continent.
Next, I had four years as assistant to the editor of the Royal Hor-
ticultural Society in London, My journalistic career had started
and I began to write for the horticultural press.

strafed the U-boat deck, and then returned to place some charges
with considerable accuracy. The South African aircraft com-
mander and his gunner waved jubilantly as they circled us be-
fore returning to the Courageous an hour or so before the carrier
went down. :

Although 76% of the Americans polled after Munich felt that
the U.S. would be drawn into any great war such as that taking
place, the U.S. was no Switzerland, nor even a Sweden, in its
method of avoiding war, but more a Norway. One financial serv-
ice which predicted World War II in its 1939 forecast now said
that the war would remain phony and that Mussolini would be
acclaimed as the greatest statesman of the age as he brought peace
to the world.

I felt that the accelerated war production was one objective on
which the U.S. could unite, since military strength could be used
in the Swiss or Baruch manner to avoid war, or to reduce our
suffering, if we chose or were led to fight. I worked at the
British Purchasing Commission and War Production Board.
While many Americans believed that Roosevelt was following
the one course that could keep us out of war, foreigners tended
to assume that Roosevelt’s policy was a subtle one to put us un-
wittingly into the war. If the pacifists had done more for defeat
than for peace, what might be called the GM approach did not
do much better. In spite of rather open warfare with Germany
in 1941 and a business man’s distrust of Roosevelt, the GM man
was convinced, fundamentally if not openly, that the world of
business was the only world, that world events were too insigni-
ficant to concern the indestructible U.S., that there would be no
war, that war production would cause widespread unemploy-
ment, that public clamor for arms could injure the world of in-
dustry, and that this clamor could justifiably be countered by the
falsehood that industry could not be converted to war. The GM
mentality in 1957 seems still unsuited for war production.

Writers now tend to treat 1941 as a year of war for the U.S,
but I was unable to find a single person before Pearl Harbor who
believed that the U.S. faced military disaster. On December 8th,
1941, I was in the historic air raid on New York and noted that
social complacency was replaced by private panic in the many
persons who jammed the telephone lines. A former GM official

[ 936 ]

in Washington now conceded that the automobile industry could
be converted, “now that there is nothing else to do.”

In July of 1942, I reported as a private to Company G of the
87th Mountain Infantry Regiment, later the roth Mountain Divi-
sion, and was sent into the woods to cut myself a club as a
weapon. After a few weeks of basic training we packed our bar-
racks bags for Guadalcanal and went on a hectic schedule of field
exercises. When this excursion fell through, we went to Hunter
Liggett, California, and then to Camp Hale, Colorado, where
smog caused many casualties. Not long before our regiment's at-
tack on Kiska I was transferred to the Air Force, in which I
spent the remainder of the war.

After the war I was engaged in war industry, statistics, and
security analysis. I moved from the East to the Los Angeles area.
In the summer of 1953 through Zee Grant of Harvard 36, I met
a very attractive San Franciscan named Nancy Carruthers. We
climbed a few mountains together that autumn but then were
separated while I traveled in Europe. As I returned, she left for
a lengthy trip around the world until late 1955. We were married
in June of 1956, and that has been by far the best move of my
career. We expect a second child somewhat before our second
wedding anniversary.

The children grew and grew, in stature if not in wisdom. Their
advancing years increased their demands on us, but also released
us from the necessity of constant watchfulness. The house that
had been “added on to” became too small and we acquired an-
other one that was larger. We assumed a little broader respon-
sibility in community affairs. We traveled a bit more extensively,
even spent a summer abroad.

Somewhere along the line in the past twenty-five years, I seem
to have lost my sense of independence. Duties have been ac-
quired: to a family, to professional and business associates, and
to my community. “Security” and “responsibility” have re-
placed “opportunity” and “freedom” as the key words in the
dictionary of American political opinion. I don’t know quite
where to place the blame for my loss — whether on the Age or
on my middle age. Perhaps both are somewhat at fault. I really

don’t care too deeply. You see, I’m no longer a rebellious young-
ster. I’m a parent.

REVIEW and reflection concerning the last twenty-five years
suggest the following highlights:
My career so far seems to have had quite a good deal of variety.

After graduation there was about a three-year Wanderjahre, in-
cluding clerking in a Wall Street bond house, working as a cow-

boy on an Arizona ranch and a brief and totally dismal attempt
as a Hollywood screen writer. After this, I went back to aca-
demic life, first at Columbia and then at Harvard where in 1944
I received an A.M. in economics and government but never quite
finished my doctorate. In 1941 I went to Washington with OPA
and served there during the entire war as economist in various
rice and rationing branches. Immediately after the war, jealous
of my friends at OSS and elsewhere who had traveled the globe
while my most glamorous activity was raising chickens on a
Maryland farm, I wangled a job as an economist and statisti-
cian on SCAP in Japan. |
The three years I spent in Japan were certainly the most stimu-
lating and personally constructive of my experience so far.
Like a number of Americans who came there at the beginning
of the Occupation, I found a double-barreled excitement. First,
there was the challenge in confronting a truly beat-up economy
(in January, 1946, Tokyo was one vast rubble heap and nation-
wide starvation came very near that spring) and attempting to
reestablish a workable economic and political organization. The
other aspect of life there for myself and many others was the
contact with a rich and ancient culture that gave us new insights
and new horizons; even after an interval of almost ten years
Japan continues to give my life fresh dimensions in many fields.
After eight years in government work it seemed to me that if I
was ever to escape permanent bondage to the bureaucratic life,
then was the time. Accordingly but with considerable trepida-
tion, I resigned from the government, returned to this country
with my family, and after some floundering entered a business
career for the first time at the age of forty. To my real sur-
prise, in the period since 1950 I have found the housing develop-
ment business, which is a rather rough and tumble leftover from
the period of the nineteenth century economic free-for-alls, to
offer at least in my case an opportunity not only for financial
reward but also for creative self-expression not really dissimilar
to the experience of establishing a new statistical series or encoun-
tering a new esthetic realm of understanding. After a while one
learns there is a common technique for entering and seeking to

no matter how tiny or recondite, he had thereby developed the
ability to become skilled in any other area he chose to enter.

It is in this respect that I am most aware of the debt I owe to
Harvard. The easy availability of the many different sectors of
learning freely offered at Harvard, although netting only a
smattering of the formal education I should have absorbed, nev-
ertheless did give me an orientation and a solid training for easily
entering new fields and taking on new problems. Above all the
educational opportunities offered by the Harvard of my day was
the tremendous intellectual nourishment presented in such
gracious abundance in the lectures and writing of Alfred North
Whitehead; the instruction and inspiration I received from him
have provided a reservoir of guiding principles and tools for un-
derstanding which have always stayed with me,

My principal hobbies and interests are participating in bring-
ing up three most rewarding children and building up a collec-
tion of Oriental and modern American pottery. At the present
time I am beginning to investigate new areas of activity in my
career, and I intend to make every effort to have the next twenty-
five years yield at least as much interest and variety as the past
twenty-five years have done.

AFTER graduation I entered the field of teaching and was very

my services.

In 1945 a reappraisal of economic realities convinced me that

I could no longer afford to remain exclusively in education. I
was offered the opportunity of learning the retail furniture trade

but my duties include buying, credit-work, trouble-shooting,
sales promotion and other functions too numerous to mention.

AFTER an interesting and lucrative (?) law clerkship in New-
ark, New Jersey, I was admitted to the New Jersey Bar. My
time and attentions were absorbed by the practice of law until
diverted by a girl in Boston, whom I married in 1941. We settled
in Newark, New Jersey.

All went well until Uncle Sam sent me “greetings.” I received
training in the Military Police and then was placed in charge of
a legal assistance office at Fort duPont, Delaware. My wife fol-
lowed me to camp to keep an eye on me, though I was moved
from post to post. She was prevented from following me over-
seas by our daughter, Judith, who was born after I left these
shores. I met my daughter, Judith, when she was a year old. I

served in England and in France with a Signal Corps unit, made
many friends and did a lot of sightseeing as a guest of our govy-
ernment. By an odd coincidence, 1 was inside Notre Dame
Cathedral in Paris at the moment the Victory in Europe was
announced, The religious impact on the persons present was
most impressive. I remained in Europe until after V-J Day, and
then “sweated” out being returned to the good old U.S.A.

After a wonderful family reunion, I did a little tax seminar
work at Harvard and renewed some old acquaintances. While
doing this, I gained admission to the Massachusetts Bar. We
returned to Newark, where I resumed the practice of law and
did a little writing. In 1948, we moved to Paterson, New Jersey,
my birthplace. After wandering so much, “home” never looked
so good. In 1953, my daughter, Judith, acquired a younger
brother, Charles. Since then, the only additions to our family
have been a dog, a bird and some fish. Surrounded by this mé-
nage, I still practise law. A man may well dedicate his work to
his family, without whose assistance it could be done much more
quickly and with less effort (and also less incentive). -

Through the years, we have had our joys and our sorrows.
We would never refer to a glass as “half empty,” but would
prefer to call it “half full’ Our two children, who are unlike
each other in every respect, do have one thing in common —
they keep us from being inactive, thereby protecting us from
stagnation, We do not know what the next twenty-five years
will bring. If they are as good as the past twenty-five, we shall
truly be able to say, “our cup runneth over.”

AFTER moving around the country on various jobs for General
Foods, we moved back to Needham, Massachusetts, where we
lived during the first year of our marriage. During the inter-
vening years I spent five years working for the John Hancock
Life Insurance Company with the remainder of the time happily
spent with General Foods in various divisions, and various jobs
in various parts of the country. The number of company moves
made while with General Foods has been nine. While some in-
convenience has been occasioned from time to time on these
moves, on the whole we have enjoyed and profited by them.
On the other hand, we are most happy to be back in Boston,
where Evelyn and I both grew up and where we have so many
ties.

I have been in sales ever since starting to work and my present
job is one of sales management, primarily. Needless to say, I
still find my work most enjoyable.

For several years I have been interested in Vintage and Classic
Cars. At present, I am in the process of restoring a 1928 LaSalle
Phaeton which promises to be a beauty when finished. Being a
member of the two major old car clubs gives the family and
me a lot of outside activity the year round when meets or tours
are held. Since old cars like old antique furniture appreciate
rather than depreciate in value, Evelyn had no objections. This,
of course, is most important.

BEING absorbed by things botanical, I did not know when to
stop studying, so after some research, a Harvard A.M., and part-
time teaching near and in Cambridge, I struggled toward and ac-
quired a PH.D. degree at Stanford University, my research con-
cerning a primarily western group of plants. There I enjoyed
experiences with interesting people and in a beautiful and varied
region. Botanical field-work afforded some wonderful camping
trips in the western part of the country. I found the field of
biology to be traversed by two main trails, the one leading to
teaching and research, the other to government or state “wildlife”
interests. Always desiring more wildlife than I could manage to
get, I found myself on the latter trail. This led to Laurel, Mary-
land, known for both forms of wildlife, mine being sequestered
at Patuxent Wildlife Research Refuge, thence to Wisconsin
where I was called a “food habits research biologist” and “leader”
of a state-federal project in which I was fortunate in having
largely cooperative and understanding personnel in the form of
myself. After three years of this I found myself in New York
City boarding docked ships and snooping among cargoes on
piers while wearing an official cap inscribed Bureau of Ento-

mology and Plant Quarantine, which meant I had become a bug
and fungus inspector of foreign imports. Inspection of New
York lasted two years.

The above period covers my marriage to Ruth Peabody, Rad-
cliffe graduate, and mother of our three girls, Anne, now aged
seventeen, Hazel, fourteen, and Susan, twelve. The girls now live
with their mother near Crestwood, New York, visiting me dur-
ing summers when I go to Maine.

Intrigued by the road I had not taken, I went, in 1946, to the
College of William and Mary as an assistant professor, teaching
largely botanical subjects. In Colonial Williamsburg I learned
to understand, but not speak Tidewater language and, as in all
new homes, I explored the countryside. While at Williamsburg
I remarried. My wife is Mary Maguire of Reading, Massachu-
setts, and a graduate of Boston University. We now have three
children, Catherine, now aged eight, Kenneth, four, and John,
three.

Every spring I would leave the flat land of the Old Dominion,
its pine and oak and marshes and bays, to take a botany class on
a visit to the exhilarating wilder mountains of West (by God)
Virginia, not knowing that by the end of 1949 I would be teach-
ing among those mountains at West Virginia Wesleyan College.
I am still there. So now I have brought you up-to-date.

All this while, however, I have never forsaken the state of my
birth, Maine, and the cottage I often visit at Pitcher Pond be-
tween Belfast and Camden, where I indulge in my hobby of col-
lecting a representative flora of Waldo and Knox Counties, in-
cluding the outer islands visited by mail-boat, lobster boat, row-
boat and twice even by canoe. This collecting bug can infect
one wherever he lives or goes. During two summers it produced
a very pleasant job for a University of Kansas research team on
Mt. Desert Island where the old camping out was resumed.

During 1954-55, I was fortunate in returning to California,
this time to Stanford’s rival across the Bay at Berkeley, on a grant
from the Fund for the Advancement of Education. The whole
family camped en route, slowly reaching California via Maine,
northerly Ontario and Montana, Five of us jammed into a six-
teen—foot trailer every night. I washed diapers in every body of
water across the continent, ranging from Jones Run to the Co-

lumbia River and gas station toilet to Lake Superior. At the
University of California I resumed some botanical research and
also returned for a pleasant spell to the receiving side of college
teaching and to the mountains, seashore and deserts of the West.
As to normally expected treatment of subjects obviously here
deleted, I have no more to say than that I am a Republican who
voted Democrat, a Unitarian in a Methodist College, a Yankee in
the South (just barely), and happy with wife, children, asso-
ciates, work and avocations. I am pleased with the road taken.
My immediate plans are Monday’s lecture on the anatomy of
the ligneous stem (as much a psychological wrestle with teen-
agers as botany), tomorrow’s hike in the wooded mountains,
identification of collected plants and supper with my family.

H. M. PULHAM approached his “I'wenty-fifth” biography
with the thought that it was like writing “something on a tomb-
stone.” I approach mine with no such funereal thoughts, for I
rather enjoy the prospect of writing when I know that a pub-
lisher has not only guaranteed to print the stuff but has been
assiduously hounding me to get it in.

By the time this is published, I will have practised law for

[ 948 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

twenty years in the same town that | have lived in for almost
my entire life. The same streets that I once meandered on school-
bound, I now tread briskly (for forty-five) more-or-less daily
in a before-breakfast jaunt to my office, about a mile and a
quarter from home. This morning constitutional is a great way
to prepare the mind and body for the daily problems that are
standard fare in the general practice of law.

In my twenty years of practice, those problems have been
so diverse that the range seems ludicrous. The first case that
I argued before our Supreme Court involved the right of a
dog-owner to recover damages from an automobile driver that
had run over the unfortunate hound. At stake was the princely
sum of $99. My most recent case in our Supreme Court, argued
only a short while before this was written, concerned the power
of the Governor of Connecticut to appoint new municipal court
judges to replace those whom he had previously appointed. The
issues involved constitutional and statutory provisions concern-
ing the distribution of the appointing power between the Gover-
nor and the Legislature.

With variety like this, it is not strange that the practice of law
should be interesting. The fact is that I enj oy practising law even
though, like most lawyers, I sometimes complain abouts its rigors.
I like to help people and I like the intellectual challenge of a
complex legal problem. If a man enjoys his work and, inciden-
tally, can take care of his family’s ever-increasing financial re-
quirements, he shouldn’t ever complain. And if he’s fortunate
enough to have some time for such delightful diversion as travel
with his family or an occasional day at the track, in the company
of frolicsome and entertaining friends, he’s fortunate indeed.

Besides work and play, I’ve found time for local politics
(Democratic Town Committee), Citizens Committee activity
(getting a school built in spite of opposition from the “ins”
serving my term as president of our Temple, United Jewish Ap-
peal work, accompanying my wife to the Great Books course
(sometimes even doing the reading), and serving as director in
the local bank and the local Chamber of Commerce. In other
words, I’m having a wonderful time. I just hope the next forty-
five years are as good.

City became regional headquarters and literally took over. Wall
Street offices and New Jersery suburbs are both very nice, but
just too far apart. Fortunately, however, I was not destined to
fight the New York-New Jersey commuting ordeal for too long.
Now we are back in the more normal and comfortable atmos-
phere of southern New England, thanks to a Westinghouse pro-
motion into the wiring device division at Bridgeport.

A BACKWARD look over the swiftly-traveled road since grad-
uation from college reveals some changes in direction from the
course that I had plotted when I came to Cambridge in 1929.

I am fairly certain that one of my reasons for choosing Har-
vard College was my intent to go to Harvard Law School in
order to become a lawyer, a goal I had anticipated since early
boyhood. This predilection for the law undoubtedly stemmed
from my father’s love of the law — an influence indicated by the
fact that both of my brothers are lawyers and my only sister 1s
married to one!

Yet, upon graduation I went, not to Harvard but to Yale
Law School, doubtless attracted by the relatively small enroll-
ment and the highly-touted freedom from the bitterly com-
petitive spirit that I had witnessed and disliked among my friends
in Cambridge who were going to the Law School while I was
in college. Yale Law lived up to its reputation. The instruction,
being more personal, was intensely stimulating and, in my opinion,
thoroughly satisfying.

After law school and the bar exams, I went into the rather
large legal department of The Texas Company, where I was

[952 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

able to obtain a rounded experience in the practice of law, both
as counselor and advocate. There, until Pearl Harbor, I was
happily engaged in the varied affairs, business and legal, of a
Jarge and expanding world-wide organization.

In June, 1942, I became one of the “60-day wonders” at N.A.S.
Quonset Point’s “Academy for Administrators” for the Naval
Air Arm, and then served in Air Operations at several Naval Air
Stations before being assigned to the billet of operations officer
on the staff of the commander of the Naval Air Ferry Wing,
where I remained until discharged from active duty as a lieu-
tenant commander in 1946.

Then, back to Texaco until 1947, when I came to American
Cyanamid Company as a member of its legal department. This
involved the general practice of corporate law dealing with
sales, production, traffic, purchasing and the other myriad prob-
lems of a diversified chemical company. Enjoying the work and
my association, I fully expected to make it my career. In 1953,
however, came another turn in the road when top management
decided that I would be more valuable as a “businessman” than
as a lawyer (it has always been my opinion that an effective
corporate lawyer had to be both), and I was sent off to the Ex-
ecutive Program in Business Administration of Columbia’s School
of Business in Harriman, New York. There, ensconced in “Ar-
den House,” the plush symbol of the business acumen of the
elder Harriman (which seemed to whisper to those budding
executives, ‘“This shows what can be done”), we reviewed the
fundamentals of the professional corporate manager’s job.

After serving awhile as assistant general manager of Cyanamid’s
Petrochemical Division, another turn in 1954 brought me to the
executive vice-presidency of Cyanamid’s engineering subsidiary,
Chemical Construction Corporation, which conducts an inter-
national business in engineering, designing and constructing
heavy-chemical plants. For three years we sought to win multi-
million-dollar engineering jobs with guaranteed, lump-sum bids
under fierce competition and faced with inevitably rising material
and labor costs —a very challenging assignment, but a difficult
way to make a profit. In 1956, Cyanamid sold Chemico and I
am now managing our Fine Chemicals Division, which manu-
factures and sells antibiotics, vitamins, and other pharmaceu-

ticals, to manufacturers of drug products throughout the free
world. The work is interesting and stimulating, and there is a
good deal of satisfaction in playing a small part in the battle to
improve our health, but it is a long way from the practice of
law!

While defending the Wabash River at a Naval Air Station in
Indiana, in 1943, my military service brought the reward of find-
ing a young lady whom I married in 1946. We live quietly in
Larchmont, New York, where we have enjoyed sailing, swim-
ming, gardening, and the antics of a small black poodle. We
have taken occasional trips to Central America, the Caribbean
and Europe, and are planning another for the spring. Soon after
we return, we are looking forward to the coming Reunion.

SINCE our Fifteenth Anniversary Report and the quite erroneous

of the big world. 1 became married and divorced, and am even
more than ever for it, but want the next one (if possible) to bring
more joy and perhaps income via a rich in-law — got any on tap?

My work assignments have, as ever, been in the midst of some
of the pretty crowded and mixed up areas of our twentieth-
century American cities — Lynn, Brighton, Dorchester and Rox-
bury. I’ve had a yen to work in this milieu, ever since the halcyon
days of organizing in the late thirties and early forties among the
CLO. shipyard workers and taxi drivers— Mike Quill’s and
Johnny Green’s outfits. One would have to kill some of those
guys to get the unionism out of them, and I got “bit by the same

bug.” So, working people in the city have become my assign-
ment as a parson, and I think the P.E. Church in a few spots is
doing a real job among our workers. Also I firmly believe that
in our solutions to city life lies hidden some of the keys to this
civilization of our era.

When my private family life fouled up three years ago, I took
on some social work training and joined the staff of the group,
“Special Youth Program,” working in Roxbury among the street-
corner teenagers. In 1954 there had been a murder of a Rabbi
there. What an eye-opener! Respectability got frightened and
had sent us in as a flying squadron because they were afraid of
what the inner city was coughing up in terms of personal and
group conduct. Our squadron was headed up by a brilliant team
under Dave Austin; with Walt Miler (anthropologist) on re-
search, Les Houston on community-wide action and five of us
out in the field. Authoritative and entrenched folk, whose identi-

ty in city government and church I'll Jet you guess at, fought a

delaying action. : Of course, there are some wonderful persons

who proved the exception, but about half of all service effort in
this type of work is usually wasted in “inter-service” friction.

But Dave Austin broke a few egg-shells to make an omelet and,

even now, a year later, after the Special Youth Program was

buried, the Irish, Negro, Yankee and Italian teenagers of Roxbury
are asking, “When are we going to get some more social workers

like we had . 22”

After the Special Youth Program was effectively interred, the
Y.M.C.A., bless its heart, caught the picture and tried to pick up
some of the pieces. We've got about twenty groups of girls and
boys in Roxbury going — some strong and some on the verge of
folding up. These are mostly Negro, but also Irish, Jewish, Greeks
and so on down the spectrum of humanity. We're badly in the
-ed, working in this portion of the city, so sling me some of
Harvard’s money! Or better still, come out to 146 Warren Street,
Roxbury, and have a look-see.

Politically, I’m still a dissenter. Rich America isn’t offering
quch at this time to the poor old world. But I’m a bug for the
uilt-in philosophy of Voltaire’s dissertation. It comes to us right
-om the ancient prophets of Israel. May be we can hold up this
anner before the world, which is in for some real tyrannies,

direct or indirect. What makes us human, I think, is to be children
of God and to use our imagination, to create and see visions, and
to talk about them and act upon them. And so I’m still rooting
for something a good bit left of the New Deal, that hasn’t had the
C.P.’s kiss of death. Find it for me and I'll join.

ON leaving the Law School, I entered a medium-sized law firm
in Boston where, for the next five years, I was engaged in trial
practice. It was a valuable experience, affording contacts with
people from all walks of life and a knowledge of the law in ac-
tion which, I think, I shall always draw upon with profit.

My wartime career was uneventful. From ensign to lieutenant
in the Naval Reserve and with duty in Washington and Honolulu
summarizes quite adequately the years 1942 to 1945. Upon re-
turn from service I became a member of the legal department
of the United Fruit Company. There I have been engaged in
the handling of corporate legal matters that I find most congenial,
and here I hope to remain until I cease to pull my weight in the
boat.

As for my personal life, there is little to report. Being a bache-
lor, I have had perhaps more than my share of leisure. This I
have spent taking a modest part in the civic life of Milton, in
Great Books discussion groups and in assisting in the religious
instruction of some of the Roman Catholic students at Milton
Academy. A little golf, the nurture of a stubborn lawn and

much reading answer the hobby question. All in all, it has been
a happy and satisfying and, I hope, in some degree a useful

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

IN the spring of senior year I met Nancy Hoyt, Radcliffe ’3;
while we were rehearsing the Brahms Requiem at Symphony Hall,
The meeting led to many good things, among them new recruits
for the HGC and the Radcliffe Choral Society. Our daughter,
Clara, is now in the Choral Society and our son Michael hopes
to enter Harvard next fall—he is already a devotee of the A
Capella Singers. Sally, Christopher and Barbara sing their parts
too.

For a dozen years after graduation, I taught French and His-
tory at Choate and undertook the multifarious jobs any willing
boarding school teacher is likely to try—helping the editors of
the school paper and the officers of the Current History Club,
harvesting corn and apples with a boys’ work crew, coaching
younger teams in hockey and six-man football. In the fall of
1941, I went to Chicago to study American History and our
family (two children then) lived at Hull House. We decided
to give some years to settlement work, but Pearl Harbor and
the great war-time load on friends and family at Choate led me
to return to the Choate faculty for the following five years.
During that time I got deeply into administration working
on admissions, letters and reports to parents, and student coun-
selling. Choate is a great school, with a live faculty, and we never
quite stop missing it. |

In 1937, Nancy and I were directors of a Friends Work Camp
near Knoxville, and in two other summers I had done volunteer
work with the American Friends Service Committee. When
the draft came, I took the Quaker stand as a conscientious ob-
jector. The basic problem of war, I was sure, lay in solving con-
flicts before they got to the shooting stage, and I decided in 1947
to take up work that might help toward better race relations—
an area of all too serious conflict in America.

For seven years we lived in Nashville, Tennessee, where I
was assistant to the late President Charles S. Johnson and then
Dean of the Basic College at Fisk University. Fisk is one of the
two or three strongest colleges serving Negro students. We saw
big strides ahead at the college under Dr. Johnson’s leadership,
and we saw encouraging steps away from segregation in the
city of Nashville. Fisk earned the right to establish a chapter of
Phi Beta Kappa and got on the approved list of the Association

[958 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

of University Women. These are simply two examples of Fisk’s
progress “into the main stream” of American life.

After a valuable year at the Harvard School of Education (a
busman’s holiday type of sabbatical!), I became headmaster of
Moses Brown School in Providence. The rewards of working
with a most capable group of boys, some skillful and dedicated
teachers, and a distinguished group of parents were great. Our
association with the Providence Friends Meeting meant a lot
to us. |

This year I am teaching History and Modern Problems at

Weston High School getting a first-hand picture of the public
school teacher’s demanding task. Try some day teaching a
class of thirty ninth-grade boys and girls whose reading levels
range all the way from 6th grade to 12th! Or try getting a
senior group to dig into the problem of foreign aid or of civil
liberties when less than half expect to enter college. Back the
schools, public and independent —for the good of your chil-
dren and grandchildren and the good of the country.
' Having been a peripatetic family during the last few years,
we have been grateful to have a summer base near the mouth
of the Kennebec at Phippsburg, Maine. We are delighted that
friends from New England and friends from Tennessee find
their way to our granite ledge looking out over marsh and sea
to Seguin Light. If you come, we'll set you to painting the
house or harvesting blueberries with us, and give you a chance
to “make a joyful noise unto the Lord” around the piano.

occuPaTION: Economist; senior staff member, Brookings Institution, a non-
profit research organization.

OFFICES HELD: Member, board of editors, American Economic Review, 1956~
58; member, Universities-National Bureau Committee on Economic
Research, 1956-58.

MEMBER OF: American Economic Association; Royal Economic Society;
Econometric Society; Harvard Club of Washington.
puBLicaTions: Articles in various professional economic journals, book re-
views, comments on conference papers, etc.
I SPENT the year after graduation studying economics at Cam-
bridge University, learning much that was new to me if not to
others, and much that had not yet been loosed to the idea-
starved world. J. M. Keynes was then lecturing on his still un-
published ideas about the theory of employment. The ferment
which his book on this subject later caused in the world of
economics had already begun in Cambridge, making it most
exciting and stimulating. In that year I also made several lasting
international friendships and acquired greater knowledge ot
what was going on in Europe, which, if you recall, was plenty.

Upon my return to the United States I entered the Treasury
Department in Washington as one of the most junior possible
economists, thereby being initiated into the then-exciting world
of the U. S. Government. In 1936 I returned to Harvard for
two years of additional post-graduate work, spending the second
in the lively atmosphere of the newly-established (Littauer)
School of Public Administration. Thence to Washington, where,
after a year of research at the S.E.C. on a new method of estimat-
ing saving by individuals, I joined a new economic policy unit
at the Department of Commerce.

My arrival there coincided closely with Hitler’s arrival in
Poland and I soon found myself involved in research on the
economic effects of the war and our defense program. This work
evolved into research and planning of price and general economic
stabilization policies under defense and then war conditions. |
spent the entire war chair-borne in Washington, mainly in the
Office of Price Administration, but towards the end as economic
adviser to the director of economic stabilization and finally to
the Price Decontrol Board. Thus I was involved in wartime
stabilization planning and controls from their conception until
their burial.

[ 960 }

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

In 1946 the Council of Economic Advisers was being organized
in the executive offices of the President. I became a member
of its first staff and was responsible for its staff work on inter-
national economic matters. While at CEA I had two tours of
duty as an adviser to U. S. delegations to meetings of the U. N.
Economic and Social Council and one to help Gordon Gray
prepare a report to the President on foreign economic policy.
I remained at CEA until September, 1952, when I went to Paris
for a short but hectic assignment as an economic consultant to
NATO. |

I then left the Government, spent one term as visiting profes-
sor of economics at Stanford University, and in 1954 began a
research study at Brookings Institution. Early in 1957 Brookings
generously allowed me time out to teach at the Salzburg Seminar
for American Studies, where, among other pleasures, I had that
of becoming better acquainted with John Putnam in four weeks
than I had ever been in four years of college, and of getting to
know his admirable wife, Susan.

The adjustment from policy work in central agencies of the
sprawling U. S. Government to the quieter and more lonely
challenge of research was not so difficult as I had expected. I am
now fully adapted to the world of research in economics, for
which [ trust sixteen years of Government work educated rather
than corrupted me.

This review of my professional life brings home the fact that
my career has consisted largely of advising others about action
decisions rather than making them myself. If this tendency re-
veals a subconscious bias, let others interpret its deeper meaning.
I feel no urge to press my luck after my own major and best
decision, recorded by my marriage in 1939. In 1942 my wife
and I moved, with our month-old first child, Mike, into a fine
house which we built in the country seven miles outside Wash-
ington. Steve arrived in 1945. The whole family went to Paris
with me for the NATO job in 1952 and we enjoyed a Christmas
in French ski country and a trip to Italy. We made our only
other long family expedition in 1954 when my teaching duties at
Stanford ended, casing the West in several short trips and a 4000-
mile tour of the area between California and Denver.

When the boys reached the stage where lack of public trans-

portation conflicted with the development of juvenile indepen.
dence, we swapped our modern house, with its four unusable
but taxable acres, for a conventional house on a country-like
street in Washington, with access to usable but non-taxable
playing fields and tennis courts. Thus we became ex-suburban-
ites, contra tentpora et mores, to the benefit of my wife’s time
and social life, our boys’ activities and independence, and my
allergies and gasoline bills. My wife is now working with two
friends in starting an art gallery for rental of paintings. Mike,
now fifteen, has great interest in science and has won honors in
local science fairs. Steve, now twelve, is an ardent radio han,
musician, and athlete.

THE necessity of taking a backward look of twenty-five years
has a twofold benefit. It gives our colleagues a chance to learn
what has transpired with their brethren during these years,
but more importantly it affords the subject an Opportunity to
scrutinize the hero of “This Is Your Life.” Speaking personally,

and bromidically, it doesn’t seem like a silver anniversary. As I
take a backward glance, it seems to me that merely to have sur-
vived a Depression and a War takes some doing. (Elihu Golde
and Carl Radlo were well-remembered friends of mine.) Just
the opportunity to live and strive, and meet the every-day chal-
lenge in a highly competitive field, has been an exhilarating
pleasure.

Charlotte and I have been blessed with three sons, named re-
spectively Charles (I), Richard (II) and William (III). Char-
lotte is sincerely worried about Henry (VIII)! All of the boys
were born in January (so as not to interfere with the golf sea-
son). I hope that the four days in Cambridge at the Reunion will
imbue the boys with sufficient Harvard spirit so that they will
go after “A’s” instead of being satisfied with “B’s”. Living in
the shadow of Boston College, as we do, may well swerve them
from the goal which I do hope they will seek out by themselves,
the goal of spending four happy years in Cambridge.

- My practice has not brought me in contact with any cele-
brated or glamorous people, but I have managed to travel ex-
tensively in Europe; four trips since graduation, and two trips
before. As a matter of fact, one of the choices for the essay on
the English exam that most of us took in the 1929 College Board
was entitled “Why Travel?” I assure you that I had no problem
with that part of the exam.

When not actively engaged in the practice of the law, which

I enjoy exceedingly, and zestfully, I spend my time writing
articles on legal subjects, and occasionally on general topics. It
is the one way I know of getting away from the hurly-burly
of the market-place and being philosophical, in a highly practical
world. This therapy, I may add, has given me a good many
pleasant hours, the fact that I have rejection slips from both
Esquire and The New Yorker doesn’t faze me at all. I’m cer-
‘ainly delighted that I don’t have to make a living at it.

LIFE for us has involved a theme with a number of variations.

Believing that one should grab onto interesting opportunities to
develop and expand one’s horizons, we have departed from the
straight and narrow path occasionally. We have found that
the risks were worthwhile; each new experience has added zest
to our lives, Our first big step brought us to Stanford Business
School, in California, after four years of varied exposure to
Boston’s financial world. The Boston Bean quickly threw away

his jacket for the informal local garb, joined in the “jolly-ups,”
and successfully avoided running over Herbert Hoover durin
his morning constitutional walks. Here we gained some lasting
friendships and a desire for a new occupation in labor relations.
Why the crises on the San Francisco waterfront ever persuaded
me to enter this field I don’t know, but I’ve been in it ever since,
and love it.

When we came back east, things were tough. It took three
discouraging months to land a job, finally, as a truck pusher on
the second shift of a textile mill. I got on finely with the boys,
but I’ll not forget the day when the overseer.sent me home with
my tail between my legs because I couldn’t operate a simple
sewing machine even after all my education. Transfers brought
me through production planning and time study work to an
opportunity to replace a former policeman who was personnel
czar in another mill. Wet behind the ears, as I was, I sur-
vived the highly charged years of union organization, and quickly
learned how agile one must be when caught in the squeeze be-
tween a bewildered management and an aggressive union.

By 1946, after three years in the Navy stateside, the family
had grown to four, so I hustled back to my trade as personnel
director, Arlington Mills, As I look back on it now, I can’t
quite understand why I wasn’t smart enough to see the hand-
writing on the wall for textiles in the north, but at least my job
forced me to pack a host of concentrated, hectic and rewarding
experiences into the next few years. Longest union contract
negotiation started ten A.M. one day and ended seven A.M. next
morning.

The big chance came for me in 1950 when Harvard Business
School opened the door to a new assistant dean with a desire
to teach others some of the mysteries of personnel work. I felt
I had been making decisions by guess and by gosh long enough.
I needed to learn more about the human relations field which
lay behind personnel work and labor relations. Teaching by
the case method was fun, though guiding a discussion with 110
students was some job, particularly when I taught a course on
defense mobilization (mostly economics). Even my slight recol-
lections of Ec. A didn’t help much — they were, in fact, dim,
since I had flunked the course.

What of life outside of work? It scems that we've tried near!
everything from raising chickens in the cellar to dogs in the
bedroom, not always with conspicuous success. The best thing
we've done was to join with “Woc” Holcombe and his family in
purchasing a small log cabin in Jackson, New Hampshire, right
in the center of the ski country. Our independent, energetic
kids have really found an outlet for all their enthusiasms in a
wonderful atmosphere en famille. For years I have been a man
of the soil, at home, struggling with all the fruits and vegetables,
yet never receiving any ‘subsidy from Uncle Sam. More recent
creative interests have involved casual furniture making to satisfy
my wife’s desire for the modern, and in the past two years we've
been doing some sketching and water-color painting here in
Europe.

No special political bent for me except one vote for FDR, and
strong support for Eisenhower. We have been more interested
in local politics in North Andover, My three years on the local
town finance committee took lots of time but was a rewarding
experience, especially the last year as chairman when I was a
spokesman at the annual town meeting. Much to our surprise,
they even voted our proposal for a new town fire engine—the
pride of the neighborhood.

As a result of an opportunity offered by the Business School,
we've had two wonderful years in Italy, and now live in Lau-
sanne. During this period we have succeeded in giving each of
our children at least one year of education in Europe. My work
in both places has been with post-graduate management training
institutes. Turin certainly taught us how different and satisfying
life can be under conditions that resemble the U. S. not a whit.
We found that one’s values may not change, but one’s horizons
and interests broaden once you learn to let the light come in.
For the last two years the family has patiently lived with my
struggles to turn out a combined text and case book looking at
human relations in industry through the eyes of the operating
executive. I hope to see it come out by the end of this year,
with a McGraw-Hill tag.

students from all over the world, to meet what is recognized as
a vital need for better managers in the future. We are happy and
healthy abroad, but we treasure home base and our closest
friends.

ical material for this book. Therefore, the Secretary is printing
the story as it was prepared, in place of an obituary.

“After graduation from the Conservatory in 1936 I entered
the teaching profession. My first position was at Fort Fairfield,
Maine, as instructor in high school mathematics. Then followed
six years in Barrington, Rhode Island, as supervisor of music
and thirteen years in School Union No. 13 in Maine, in the same
capacity. Last spring I kicked over the traces, deserted the teach-
ng profession and entered the insurance business. 1 am sull
ctive in music as a church organist and a member of the Port-
and Symphony Orchestra and the Portland Lyric Theatre.

“As for spare time, that is devoted in winter to remodeling, one

1 the summer we go out of doors and devote ourselves to gar-
sning with a strong emphasis on iris in which line we have tried
me hybridizing without any startling results as yet.”

FOLLOWING graduation in June, 1933, 1 was fortunate in
being able to continue my education in Graduate School. In
June, 1934, Boston College conferred the degree of Master of
Arts upon me and I entered a teaching career in secondary educa-
‘ion in Massachusetts, Activities in the public school systems of
Vatertown and Revere, Massachusetts, occupied my first years, °
“hile I continued graduate studies in history and education at
farvard and Boston College. In June, 1936, 1 was fortunate in
ceiving an appointment as assistant professor of history at
ston College, where I held forth in the fields of ancient and
nerican history until June, 1938. At that time, having received
doctorate of Philosophy, I accepted a position as assistant dean-
fessor (head of department) of history at St. Michael's Col-
, Burlington, Vermont. ‘There my educational sojourn lasted
1 February, 1940, when I transferred my “loyalties” to the
on Public School System.
a result of an obligation incurred when | accepted an
'C commission at Harvard in 1933, I was called to active

Anita Mulcahy of Boston. Of all my good fortune, this has been
the best.

Moving to the European Theatre of Combat in 1944, I re-
mained with the 89th Infantry Division throughout World War
Il. Thanks to a favorable fate, promotions came regularly ad-
vancing me to captain (1942) to colonel, Chief of Staff of the
division in 1945. When the European phase of the war came to
a close in April, 1945, I drew the detail from SHAEF of super-
vising the personnel administration of all troops returning to
the United States through Port of Le Havre for reshipment to
the Far East — 1,000,000 troops from April, 1945, to January,
1946. .

In February, 1946, I requested relief from military duty. At
that time I returned to the Veterans’ School of the Boston Public
School System and to Boston College as professor of history
and education (Evening Division). In the fall of 1947, I was
transferred to the Phillips Brooks School, Roxbury, Massachu-
setts, as second-in-charge.

With the outbreak of the Korean Affair in 1950, the Pentagon
quickly decided that I was of more value to the military service
of the nation than I was to its civilian educational efforts. Re-
called to active military service, I was given the mission of estab-
lishing a reception center at Ft. Devens, Massachusetts, capable
of processing all inductees, enlistees, reservists, and reassignees
of the Department of the Army within the New England States,
New York and New Jersey. From August, 1950, to August,
1951, 100,000 soldiers and officers were processed in that recep-
tion center with only two AWOLS, The Navy, the Air Force,
and Congress itself sent investigators to learn the secret of the
operation. No secret—just, efficient, and humane processing.

August, 1951, found my activities transferred to Headquarters,
Far East Command, Tokyo, Japan. I must confess that I would
have preferred to remain at Ft. Devens; but mine was not to
reason why. As Chief of Special Services and Educational Ac-
tivities for the United Nations Forces in the Orient, I promul-
gated recreational and educational policies for Generals Matthew
Ridgway and Mark Clark until September, 1952. It was my
good fortune to meet many Harvard men — civilian as well as
military—in the Far Fast. Harvard was well represented in

[970]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

Japan, Korea, Formosa, Okinawa and the Philippines. Among -
this group was Lt. Col. “Pick” Walker, ’33, whom I met during
an inspection trip to Hq, I Corps, USA, Korea.

In September, 1952, I requested my release from active mili-
tary service. In accordance with the Department of Army direc-
tives concerning involuntary recall to active duty, my return to
civilian life was authorized, coupled with a mobilization assign-
ment to the Office of the Secretary of Defense—colonel, Military
Personnel Officer (Army). At the present time as I write this
résumé, I am under consideration for appointment as Assistant
Division Commander, g4th Infantry Division (Reserve). I must
also confess that perhaps the promotions and assignments which
were mine during military service might well be explained by
six personal decorations received during that duty.

Although I jhave been a civilian again since September, 1952,
I am still being queried as to why I did not stay in military
service. My answer to all is my firm belief in civilian education
and a sincere desire to provide my wife and daughter a “firmly-
rooted” home. Although preferring civilian pursuits, like the
Minutemen of old, I am still ready to serve in an emergency.

As I finish penning this statement, I stand first on the promo-
‘ion list to become a headmaster in the Boston Public School
system. Twenty-five years after graduating from Harvard, I
ondly hope that, in some small way, I can contribute, in a
vorthwhile manner, to the rejuvenation of American education.

in greenbacks” at the present time. After holding down a variety
of jobs, in 1942 I finally became an instructor in Latin at the
Eastern Junior High School in Lynn, where I have been ever
since.

I have led a very quiet, uneventful existence since I received
my sheepskin in 1933, but I must confess, considering my tem-
perament, that I am quite satisfied with that mode of living,
Since garnering my A.B. cum laude, 1 have been taking courses
off and on at Boston University until I have now amassed forty-
five additional semester hours of credit in a variety of subjects.
No doubt I shall continue to take courses as my fancy dictates.

My hobbies at the present time are reading, walking and
gardening. The last occupies my attention during the summer
months when I pack myself and the family off to nearby Saugus,
where my parents own an acre of land. It isn’t exactly an idyllic
spot, but it meets my needs well enough. It gives me a chance
to do a bit of “organic” gardening. I have become intensely in-
terested in this matter of “organically” grown food. It is my
unshaken belief that food grown the “organic” way (using only
natural fertilizer) is nutritionally superior to food grown on soil
saturated with artificial fertilizer. I have a strong suspicion that
the alarming increase in the degenerative diseases is due to the
devitalized, chemicalized, processed foods we eat, lacking in the
essential minerals and vitamins that are conducive to a vigorous,
healthful existence.

As for my family, I am justifiably proud of an understanding,
patient, self-sacrificing spouse and two fine, devoted daughters.
As far as my political convictions are concerned, I started out
as a Democrat, but at the present time I owe my allegiance to
the Republican party. It is quite possible, however, that I may
return to the Democratic camp before the 1960 presidential
election.

MY first three or four years out of college, I worked as a vacuum

tube production engineer at Raytheon and Triad Manufacturing

Companies. In 1937 I joined the Research Department of the
Foxboro Company, and after two years transferred to the Sales
Department in the Application Division. During World War
II, I was engaged in a special project manufacturing radar train-
ing equipment, and also did some instructing evenings at Harvard
for specialized Army courses in electronics and electrical engi-
neering. Since then, my work has been the preparation of instruc-
ion and parts manuals for the industrial instruments manufac-
ured by the Foxboro Company. My job has grown from a
me-man affair to a department consisting of several engineers
loing technical writing, an artist, and a half-dozen ladies em-
loyed in specification and book compilation. Work at Foxboro
rovides the advantages of bringing up a family in a small New
ngland town, where there are still open lots for baseball, woods
or camping and streams for fishing.

Music has always been my main extra-curricular activity, going

back to the days when I was a rebellious youngster sawing on a
fiddle or pounding on the piano. To these instruments, I added
the piano-accordion shortly after my marriage; and a little later,
when the Foxboro Band needed a baritone horn player, I took
up this instrument. I am now the violin soloist at my church and
occasionally play the violin or accordion at other functions. And,
the horn comes in handy for parades. I have inflicted these
musical instruments not only on my own three children, but on
scores of other aspiring youngsters, who come to me in the
hopes that they can learn to play quickly and painlessly. The
degree of success varies, but my own children are my best ad-
vertisements. My boys, Peter and Gerry, have specialized on
the accordion and trumpet, and are well-known in the community
for their appearances in amateur shows and other entertainments.
Carol, too, has made her debut. All three children have main-
tained highest grades in school and I trust that the Harvard
Classes of 1964 and 1967 will include the name of Saparoff.

A secondary hobby of mine is photography, with eight mm.
movies and 3D slides being my latest interests. And, of course,
we have a tape recorder. As for sports, skiing has become too
strenuous, and I now settle for swimming in the summer and
bowling the rest of the year. Every year, during the month
of July, the family takes a pilgrimage to Provincetown at the
tip of Cape Cod, where we pass a few fleeting weeks amidst
picturesque surroundings and congenial friends.

Well, this is my story. I can’t imagine who might be really
interested. Except, perhaps, a certain Ruth Mahoney who has
been heckling me for weeks with postcards signed, at different
stages, Trustingly, Frantically, Desperately and Sadistically
Yours, Class Report Editor. I hope this report is worth the an-
guish I have caused. As for myself, I suspect I shall miss the
weekly reminder, which always provided a chuckle as well as
a stab at my conscience. ,

in active service. After our first son's birth, as we pushed his
carriage through Harvard Yard, I experienced a wry sense of
continuity—little did [ anticipate in 1927, such a use for Harvard.

Our small apartment began to seem crowded with infant gear
— wartime housing was hard to come by and our search for
larger quarters in 1946, reached out as far as Groton. My com-
pany moved to Waltham and I became a commuter. Finally
the New England winter roads made it desirable to find some-

thing nearer. After a few assorted attempts, ended up in my
present position as welding engineer; near home and an interest-
ing occupation, but a far cry from the Diplomatic Service.

Acquired two more children and rapidly became immersed
in the life of a very busy small town and the usual children’s ac-

THE fascinating (?) facts of the Schafers’ ménage are so varied
and colorful that I’ll start where the Twentieth left off — with
me hanging over the cliff — becoming fat and forty in Ken-
tucky’s Blue Grass. On second thought, for you who may have
missed the scintillating literature I added to the Fifteenth and
Twentieth — a brief review is in order. Following the Business
School, I was a Wall Street grain market analyst and during the
War headed up the O.P.A. Flour and Wheat Section in Wash-
ington where a long bout with rheumatic fever kept me from
becoming General (or Admiral) Schafer.

After that, I was successively economist of Pillsbury Mills
in Minneapolis, Hercules Powder in Wilmington and General
Baking in New York .. . interspersed with nautical junkets
such as the Chicago-Mackinac Island sailing race, the Miami-
Nassau race and the St. Pete-Havana race.

My first wife, Margaret Latady, Radcliffe ’37, having died
in 1943, I married Ann Shelly of Philadelphia in 1948. We moved
to Chicago where I joined Hales & Hunter, a privately-owned
feed manufacturer. After a year there, my company bought a
mill in Lexington, Kentucky, and sent me down to manage it.
We have lived here happily ever since, adding to our crown
three jewels, Elsa seven, Robbie five, and Elizabeth three.

Tennis and badminton help the spread (and I don’t refer to
he commodity markets). Some civic work and lots of inter-
iewing of prospective customers for the (brain?) (sweat?)
gin?) mills known as Harvard, Radcliffe and Andover keep
ne from the horse races. Kentucky being 47th of all the states

ducationally speaking, it is an exhilarating experience to find a

[977]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

boy of Harvard caliber here. (Besides I have to keep my hand
in for when my own little hill-billy comes of age.)

Our three small ones occupy us busily, but in odd years we
have managed to tour such garden spots as Bermuda, Nassau,
Haiti, Jamaica, the Virgin Islands and Cuba where Ada and Wal-
ter Arensburg royally get out the red carpet. Music, from
chamber to jazz, is a favorite avocation, and we miss the waltzing
groups in Boston and New York, though my wife feels my
dancing stopped with the minuet.

In short, I’m still around, trying to contribute a little to society,
trying to enjoy life a little, trying to feed my small hungry
mouths, and awesomely realizing the speed with which these
twenty-five years have gone. Be merry, for tomorrow we'll wake

up to find it is the Fiftiecth (unless Sputnik awakens us on another
planet).

2§TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT
Writing . . . and the broad field of communicating ideas to the
public .. . have been my basic occupations for the last twenty-
five years. Chronologically . . . during the months just prior to
graduation, I organized and directed an Audience-Preference Sur-
vey for the Columbia Broadcasting System, in cooperation with
the Harvard Psychology Department. Using W.P.A. enrollees,
we measured such things as the persuasiveness of male versus fe-
male voices reading identical commercial copy for a variety of
products; optimum length for a radio spot announcement, reten-
tiveness of various forms of program material (particularly of an
educational nature). This was one of the earliest motivational
research projects in radio.

Then to New York for a try at a job on a newspaper, in radio or
on a magazine. With no luck in that bleak year, back home to
Cleveland and the rounds of the local papers. By July I was dis-
couraged enough to decide that ’'d never make the grade and so
I took the only job advertised in the papers . . . selling auto-
mobiles on straight commission. Surprisingly, I earned a living at
it for four years despite the fact that my heart was not in it. I

stayed that long because I had the chance to handle the company’s
advertising and write the script for a weekly radio show in addi-
tion to developing their fleet sales department. And the pay was
good!
Then to the New York Life Insurance Company for a‘ “phonied-
up” job as education and public relations director; their way,
then, of recruiting another insurance salesman. On the side, I
started handling promotions for concert courses, local community
activities and political candidates, including myself . . . running
as a Democrat for the State Legislature. By 1941 I had enough
activity with civic groups under my belt to volunteer for the job
of Executive Secretary for Information and Education of the
Sreater Cleveland Civil Defense Council. The week after Pearl
arbor I started on this job which, during the early months of the
var, was.a full-time project of coordinating area activities for

AFTER graduating from the Medical School, Schoenbach be-
came a resident physician at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.
In 1941 and 1942 he returned to Harvard as an instructor at the
Medical School. During World War II, he served on the War
Department’s board for the investigation of influenza and the
control of other epidemic diseases and as consultant to the Sec-
retary of War. After the war he was associate professor of pre-
ventive medicine at Johns Hopkins University and medical
consultant to the Veterans Administration. He was professor
of medicine at the College of Medicine of the State University
of New York and director of medicine at Maimonides Hospital,
both in Brooklyn. A research expert in bacteriology and the
chemotherapy of infectious diseases, he was engaged in re-
search on the chemotherapy of cancer at the time of his death.
He had also participated in studies at Johns Hopkins Medical
School which reportedly developed a compound that helped
starve cancer cells, Two months before his death, the American

N flight high over the San Bernadino Mountains, heading east
ver the desert, is a good time and place to look at life and re-
ew my activities for a quarter of a century. It sounds so long
It seems so short and insignificant from here.
Three years at the Harvard Law School completed my Cam-
idge days; then to Chicago and five interesting years practising
v with Bell, Boyd & Marshall. A happy marriage in 1940 added
rything to this period. The year 1941 brought: a shift from law
a business career which lasted five years and moved us from
icago to Oklahoma City. In 1943 our able, i interesting daugh-
Marcia, was born. Many changes came with 1946. Our

[ 983 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

rocket pilot-space-traveler-to-be son, Philip, was born in May;
in the fall of the year I decided to return to the practice of law,
The break gave us a chance for a few months off and a swing
through South America. Ten active years of law practice in
Oklahoma City slid by. During those years I had the pleasure
and pain of teaching Wills for two semesters at the College of
Law at the University of Oklahoma. Classes are refreshing after
the routine of the legal-business world. You feel you know so
little and it is so hard to get the students to respond and think.
They are just like you and me—only younger and T.V. brighter.

The past slides into the present with its current and pressing
problems. In September we yielded to the Call of the West, tore
up our roots and moved to Rancho Santa Fe, California. All we
need is a home, friends and a new legal career. California does
not welcome foreign lawyers, the present joins the past and,
just like twenty years ago, I now face a Bar exam in February
before I can practise my profession. Law is a jealous mistress —
fun and at times funny and exasperating.

The sun has set, the motors drone on; the past is gone; the
future is all that can be interesting. The writing of this gives
me one regret—no more anguished pleas from my old room-
mate, Don Sullivan. No more mail!

uation the Harvard Business School seemed to be the best place

to hibernate. Here I majored in banking but I ended up by being

a food peddler. They always say people have to eat, but the
sequel of that story is people don’t have to eat your products.
However, through the years Best Foods has done very well in
the competitive food industry and I have enjoyed the fast tempo
of the daily struggle for Mrs. Consumer’s food dollars. My
work has taken me to most of the cities in the United States and
Canada and has convinced me more than anything else that we
have achieved a remarkable sense of balance i in living and govern-

ment in this country.

During my business career I have had one delightful respite
from the conventional pattern. In 1950 I returned to the Harvard
Business School to attend the Advanced Management Program.
This gave me a rare moment of seeing the forest again instead
of the trees and a very pleasant and stimulating thirteen weeks

vith a fine group of businessmen.

Travelling and our family have restricted very much my civic
articipation to only those things that are not time-consuming.
ur family, two active teen-age sons and a pretty, vivacious, and
iderstanding wife, has had a lot of fun together and we are
oking forward to more interesting chapters as we continue to
ow up together. Recently we moved into a new house and

at has brought out latent talents in unsuspected fields of en-
AVOr, despite the so-called simplicity of “‘do- -it-yourself” direc-
ns. I can’t resist the temptation to note that if all of us can
the right job at home there will be no juvenile delinquency.
Thus, contributions of my time have been small to political
other outside organizations and fund-raising activities. Per-
s this has forged my political convictions to be simple but in
Ly cases hard to live with. Basically, in politics my allegiance
been to the man rather than a party and my philosophy has
| that any party or faction will react like dead fish when they

‘around too long. We have had enough of this on all fronts,

NO doubt it is a little strange, even in these days of rapid changes,
that one who finished college concentrating in chemistry should
find himself now a public administrator in the Federal Civil
Service. This has resulted in my case, certainly not from any
lack of interest in chemistry or science — which continues to
have a great fascination — but rather from an even greater sub-
sequent interest in the public service.

After college I did one year of graduate work in organic
chemistry under Harvard’s great Elmer Peter Kohler. There-
after I spent six years in a family business in Minnesota, inter-
rupted by two years of graduate work at what was then the
fledgling Littauer Center for Public Administration at Harvard.
The end of the war found me in the Division Artillery Head-
quarters of the 103rd Infantry Division in Innsbruck, Austria —
than which, I suspect, there is no lovelier city in all of Europe.
At least it seemed so in the aftermath of the fighting.

Since 1946 I have been on the staff of the Bureau of the Bud-

get in Washington, where I have been concerned primarily with

the Nation’s atomic energy program and some related scientific

and technical programs. This specialization has involved num-

erous visits to the installations of the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion, and I must admit that the sights and particularly the smells

of A.E.C.’s chemical laboratories invariably bring back fond and

nostalgic memories of the stimulating days spent in Mallinckrodt

and Converse. The work at the Bureau of the Budget has been
for me very rewarding, particularly in the fast-moving field of
atomic energy. The Bureau is a sort of cross-roads of the Fed-

eral government, it has broader and more varied functions, I

mon than is generally realized.

A report of this kind should focus on personal things, Tm
sure, and particularly on one’s own family. Here I ‘have, un-
fortunately, very little to report, because I am still single. In
the meantime, I take great pride and pleasure in eight nieces and
nephews.

How then does one spend his personal life? To be sure,
there are times when the pace on Pennsylvania Avenue leaves
little enough time for leisure. But, when time permits, serious
music and art bring rich rewards and Washington has much of
both — not to mention the vast treasures of recorded music
available these days at the flick of a switch. The interest in great
music, first stimulated at Harvard, has added much indeed to
the years since then. And then, too, there is always far more to
read — just to keep abreast of our times, let alone trying to catch
up on the past — than time permits.

Here we are on the threshold of launching into outer space,
ind a moment’s reflection must remind one that in twenty-five
years, however crowded the years have seemed, he has done
ittle more than scratch the surface of the richness and fullness
f living on this planet.

AFTER graduation there followed four years of law study,
summer travel abroad including Russia, and two years of stock
brokerage, before affiliating in 1939 with the Empire Trust Com-
pany. By 1942 I had become secretary of the bank’s investment
sub-committee when the Army beckoned. Four years of service
followed in such warlike spots as North Dakota, Florida and
Delaware. Three years of this time were spent as adjutant of
a small post. For the record I was discharged in 1946 as a captain
with awards of the Army Commendation Ribbon and the Con-
spicuous Service Cross (No. 8840) by New York State.

After returning to the bank I was assigned in 1950 to the job
which I now hold as trust officer of our Uptown Office in the
Rockefeller Center area. This type of work enables one to be of

aid to many disparate people in practically every aspect of per-

American Bible Society and on the investment committee of
An Association for the Relief of Respectable, Aged and Indi-

Except for a trip abroad in 1950 we have spent our summers
in Newport, Rhode Island. Recently we purchased a house
there and now week-end from New York at every opportunity.
Newport, with its interesting and varied history, is, like so many
communities, in process of further evolution, and I hope to be
of some help in shaping this development in conformity with
the natural beauty and traditions of the area.
In closing this brief account I should like to say thanks to a
wonderful girl for the immeasurable inspiration provided in a
happy partnership of almost twenty years.

[ 989 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

this résumé may turn out, I am even more worried after reading
the excellent “sample lives” sent us as examples.

I was among five or six in our Class who took the five-year
combined engineering and business administration courses and
consequently we spent another year at Harvard, not graduating
until 1934. Of course, ’33 is still our Class. Upon graduating I
accepted a position with Crunden Martin Manufacturing Com-
pany as mechanical engineer and assistant superintendent, and I
am happy to say after twenty-four years I am still with the same
firm as vice-president and factory manager. The company manu-
factures many metal, paper and rubber products. During the
war we were doing essential war work and I was deferred. Thus
my war years, although very busy, were unexciting compared
with those of the men in actual combat.

As far as my family life is concerned, back on August 3,
1940, I married Stephanie Ostie and on February 24, 1942, our
first child, Joanne, was born. She is now fifteen and in her sopho-
more year in high school, Our first son, Richard, thirteen, was
born December 6, 1944, and he is hoping to graduate from gram-
mar school this June, Our youngest son, Stephen, now nine,
was born on September 27, 1948. This completes our family,
except for an Irish setter, two hamsters, one parakeet and several
tropical fish. Seeing the children grow up makes us realize how
old we are actually getting to be.

So far my travels have been limited to the North and East,
but we hope to tackle the West now that the children are older.
My chief interests are still my work, family and home.

various learning-type jobs, some of which became positions. The
last to become a position was in Interstate Aircraft Corporation,
later Interstate Credit Corporation, which in the late 1930's
pioneered in financing aircraft for the fixed base operator and
private buyer. This work, though it involved many hours of
travel, yielded an excellent opportunity to see America first, and
by air, in divers types of small private aircraft. It was here that
I logged some five thousand air hours and saw all forty-eight
states but one (Florida).

As war came, a physical disability prevented entrance into
the military effort. Interstate became the management group of
Northwestern Aeronautical, a company which produced about
one thousand military gliders. During its formative period I
served as vice-president, then later as a consultant to other com-
panies involved in the military glider production program. While
in this position we, that is, my newly-acquired family of one
bride, one stepson and one rather large French poodle, landed
in California, where we have remained except for a brief exile
in Texas. The exile occurred while serving with Consolidated
Western Steel and involved being the liaison between Consoli-
dated and Kaiser during construction of the Kaiser Aluminum
plant near New Orleans. The exile over, we returned to Cali-
fornia, but as a smaller family, having left our son, John, behind
in the hands of a lovely and lovable Texas belle. The course of
nature being such as it is, we now have two Texan grandchildren,
a John and a Suzanne.

Here in California we manage to spend our leisure time in
our lovely garden; in occasional Mexican trips to dodge the
“occasional” smog; at the symphony, ballet, or opera; and in the
pleasure one find in good friends. Some of these, of course, are
Harvard, others from both eastern and western scholastic back-
grounds.

My flying days seem to be past except for an occasional bout
with the controls of our company Lodestar on a trip to one of
the outlying plants—then only for a while in the co-pilot’s seat.
My desk is where I now spend two-thirds of my working time
and where I fight the unending battle of making our division’s
plans and projects fit into the rules and limits of the budget. It

[ 992 ]

is fun and interesting as it becomes the realization of a long

range plan, this battle of the budget. As long range planning for

the division also falls among my responsibilities, along with the
budget, this so-called battle involves frequent changing of hats,
from the budget hat, somewhat like a bowler, to a Stetson, some-
what less conservative.

Politically speaking, I belong to what for sixteen years,—no,
more—was the minority group, the Republican party. While
in Texas it was really a minority until Ike. Now, in some respects
still a minority, we at least have an administration and I can
commend myself for having twice voted for a winning presiden-

tial candidate.

the years, having moved a total of seven times due to family
expansion and other reasons relating to real estate matters. In
the spring of 1953 we bought a brownstone house on Ninety~
fourth Street, complete with a back yard with a large apple tree,
and we hope that our moving days are over for a while.

To my friends from Suburbia who have been saying to me
for years that they can’t understand how I can bring up my
family in such an unhealthy place as New York City, my only
comment has been that my kids have missed far fewer days of
school every year than most of theirs—and here I knock
violently three times on wood! We city folks have every germ
in the world blown at us every day in the year, and so build up
immunity of sorts to a good many of them. Let the Suburbanites
have their draughty houses and their two and three-hour-a-day
train rides. We like it in old Manhattan!

In the fall of 1933 I started out with Carlisle, Mellick & Com-
pany, odd-lot dealers on the New York Stock Exchange, and
have been with this firm and its successor (due to a merger in
1941), Carlisle & Jacquelin, ever since. I have been a member
of the Exchange since 1936 and a partner of our firm since 1940.
If my readers, like most everyone else in the United States, do
not know what odd-lot dealers are or what they do, I should
be most happy to have them attend one of the many classes or
lectures which I give on this subject during the course of each
year. Suffice it to say here that an odd-lot of stock is an order for
a number of shares which is less than the unit of trading in that
stock. Most stocks on the New York Stock Exchange are traded
in one hundred-share units. In these stocks we handle orders
for one through ninety-nine shares.

With me im our “House on gqth Street” at the moment are
my lovely wife, Peggy, sister of °33’s Vernon Woodworth;
our seventeen-year-old daughter, Ellen, a senior at Brearley

School, who is sweating out the college situation along with
the rest of her classmates; a ten-year-old fireball and southpaw
pitcher, Stuart (“Timmy”), a fourth grader at Buckley; and
a beguiling four-year-old nursery schooler, Danny. Our oldest,
nineteen-year-old Anita, is a sophomore at Radcliffe, and so
wrapped up in and enthusiastic about Cambridge that we prac-

tically never see her at all. We are hoping that we may get a
glimpse of her at the Reunion.

As I look back at my career both before and since college,

I think I must be one of the last of the “Old School Conserva-
tives.” Look at the record: I went to Fay School, St. Mark’s,
and Harvard, am a member of the New York Stock Exchange,
and am an active and lifelong member of the Republican Party.
Furthermore, I’ve had only one wife and intend to hold on to
her for as long as she'll have me! Old-fashioned as the whole
set-up may sound to some, I’ve never regretted any one of these
affiliations, and my greatest joy and satisfaction in life has been
in working for all of them. This has most certainly been true of

‘ROM outward appearances I would pass for a typical Harvard
lumnus — indifferent enough to lead you to think I thought
re College and the town of the same name were at the same
cation! However, on closer scrutiny on the inside, I am typical
1ough to comply with preexisting concepts of what graduates
ould do to carry on the tradition after commencement, i.e,
ntinue to educate yourself, for one.
Having been so unfortunate (or fortunate) as to have had more
sure time to fill than most do, I soon decided that the pleasures of
> mind were more varied and got one into less trouble than the
re limited animal pleasures, so I pursued the former with
:to and set to emulate former President Eliot with his five-
t bookshelf of classics. If my reading was not quite as varied
Yr. Eliot would prescribe, I did manage to wander quite far

Id from my starting point, music. Apropos of books and

factual knowledge, one point grows increasingly evident: on
reading one book one thinks he knows something; after two,
one begins to have doubts; and after three or more, all one can
be sure of is what he does not know! This is like the cocksure-
ness of our twenties yielding to doubtful thirties and forties,
fading into blasé or indifferent fifties and sixties. At seventy we
are certain only of doubt, taxes and death. Too, with the chang-
ing concepts in some science, after twenty more years one’s
first acquired viewpoint is out of date.

To cite one instance: when young we were taught to consider
the one-celled animals crude and primitive when compared with
the highly complex and specialized mammals. Now the simple
celled animal capable of all the functions is thought to be older
in evolutionary order than the complex mammals who are com-
parative newcomers in the field. As with machines, simplicity
comes last — even though we try to disguise the fact with ever
more gadgets. To all this you will say, “He never got over being
a student!” But in the broad sense, should we ever? I have ob-
served whereas men live to the seventies, most of them have died
mentally, emotionally and spiritually by the time they reach
the thirties. In this I am not preaching — merely observing.
We all fall victim to the dictates of existence.

I like best the outdoors, the writings of Joseph Wood Krutch,
the terse verse of Emily Dickinson and three wonders from the
North Country, the symphonies of Sibelius, the voice of Flag-
stad and the beauty of Garbo (all except the feet!). These are
but a few items taken at random. A full list would be boring
and to no point.

In my twenties and thirties I consumed much paper and ink
in writing serious music in various forms, but grew increasingly
critical of my efforts with added years. Now I am more of a
critic than a creator. The former hamstrings the latter. Some-
one has observed that to be a first rate composer one must
be either a genius or an idiot, and I can’t lay claim to exactly
either category! So I fall between two stools, as most do with
high aspirations. I have turned out music affirming a personality,
but music worthy to be called art must be something more than
this. It must plumb the depths and scale the heights of the
spirit—a rather large order. We are told that in the serious

music of our days never before has plain mediocrity carried such
high standards. Perhaps this notion will let me out gracefully!

THE compulsion to meditate on almost a half life makes one pon-
der on what is planned and what is chance. In the middle thirties,
many of us had to improvise and make the most of the meager
opportunities which came our way. I suspect that such hard
economic discipline serves us well with sturdy values now in
improved times. Like many others, I would have settled in those
early days for a more modest future.

My career in the food industry began from the fact that the
first technical job for pay presented itself at General Foods
Corporation’s Walter Baker Division in 1934. This looked more
tangible than marking time with further graduate work. My
term in the food industry has encompassed the growth of a new
profession, food technology. This is the field in which I have
endeavored to become authoritative with the specialty of a chem-
ical engineering approach.

In 1939, I was transferred to the then-new Central Research
Laboratory of General Foods in Hoboken, New Jersey, which
was the source of many developments that have emancipated
your wives from kitchen drudgery. Perhaps you question
whether instant coffee, frozen or dehydrated foods, prepared
soups, Jell-O with “locked-in flavor,” etc. come under the head-
ing of Advancement. At any rate, in our business we believe
that such items are a large part of the complex of today’s better
life.

In 1941, I deprived Dr. Donald H. Menzel, Harvard Observa-
tory, of his attractive secretary-technical assistant, who forsook
typewriter and mathematics to become Mrs. Seltzer. Except
for wartime activities in places like Kankakee, Illinois, and Keo-
kuk, Iowa, we have lived mostly in Teaneck, New Jersey. Here
we have the comfort of having early recognized the need for
public school expansion and improvement. With Harold Ham,
also ’33, and a few active others, we toiled through referendum
campaigns, early defeats and final victorics. We now have a
good faculty, good schools and enlightened town government.

and applications of television and techniques to astronomical problems.

BY the time I had finished Dr. Bart J. Bok’s beginning astronomy

course as a junior at Harvard I knew unequivocally what career

[999]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

] wanted to follow. As a graduate student at the Harvard Ob-
servatory, I met Dr. Shapley’s assistant, Muriel Mussells, and
married her. However, since I had been awarded a Parker travel-
ing fellowship, I first had to propose this marriage to Dean
George Birkhoff. Fortunately, both the Dean and Muriel ac-
cepted!

Following four years at the McDonald Observatory at West
Texas where both of our children were born, we spent two
years at Mr. Wilson Observatory in the presmog days where |
held a National Research Council fellowship. With the advent
of World War II we went to Cleveland where I taught engineer-
ing to the Navy, navigation to the Coast Guard and did classi-
fied research for the Army and Bell Labs, chiefly on ballistics
problems at the Case Institute of Applied Science.

I came to Vanderbilt in 1946, as director of the small, old
Barnard Observatory. Part of my job was the task of interesting
people in contributing to a proposed new observatory. With the
invaluable aid of Mr. A. J. Dyer we persuaded eighty-two firms
and individuals to contribute materials and services equivalent to
a quarter of a million dollars toward the project. “The money to
put all these parts together was supplied largely by Mr. Dyer.
The new-design telescope, largest of its type, was completed and
dedicated in 1953. During the construction of the observatory
and our residence located on a high hill, ten miles from Nashville,
we all lived in a trailer on the site in order that I might supervise
all details of the construction. This trailer now sits on one of
the beautiful TVA lakes and is used as a weekend headquarters
during the summers for our fishing and water skiing.

Our house near the observatory overlooks the beautiful sur-
rounding hills. Muriel designed it with a story-and-a-half facing
north for her studio, When she is not painting someone’s portrait
she is busy around the grounds. She built a brick patio, a stable
for our three Tennessee walking horses and has just completed
a brick swimming pool! They laughed when she started to mix
mortar, but she laid all 7,000 bricks in it last summer and we
swam in it from late August until early October. Fortunately,
our three miniature dachshunds, Lyra, Scutum and Vega, don’t
like water.

When I was asked to do a five-minute weather show on TV,

[ 1000 ]

I agreed to do so for a week or two until they found someone
to do it regularly. That was seven years ago and I’m still at
it! It’s fun, takes little time and 1 manage to sneak a surprising
amount of astronomy into it.

Astronomers love to travel this earth as well as out into space.
Muriel and I spent the summers of 1948 and 1953 in Europe at-
tending the International Astronomical Union meetings in Zurich
and Dublin. This summer we are off to Europe again, where
I will attend the meetings in Moscow and Leningrad for two
wecks while Muricl and daughter Gail stay in the Austrian
Alps. Carl, Jr. a sophomore geology major at Vanderbilt, pre-
fers to return to Colorado where he fishes and hunts rocks with

Sputnik not only promised to change our way of life, but it
nearly killed me. I fell off the roof of the observatory last Octo-
ber while observing the d— thing. I broke my right wrist and
elbow rather badly and am in for a lengthy therapy. They call
me Sputnik’s first casualty. At any rate —stand by to blast off

for the moon one of these days. Muriel says I can go on the second

trip.

since then except for the years 1942-46, which were spent in the
Amny. From 1949 to 1954, I had the good fortune to work at
a branch of the Institute that had been set up in San Francisco
during the building of the new center in Bethesda. Of course,
we almost immediately became rabid Californians of the San
Francisco variety. When the time came to go back east again
we almost felt like original settlers, having lived in the Golden
State longer than most of the people we met out there.

Now we find again that the east has its own attractions. We
enjoy the change of seasons, including winter; as I type these
words I can see my son joyously playing in the eleven inches of
snow that has just fallen. I have been engaged in pretty much
the same thing over my whole working life, laboratory research
on biochemistry and in particular on the biochemistry of cancer;
and at the present time I expect to go on with it for some time
to come.

AFTER graduation I merely followed the originally formu-
lated plan of my life to enter medicine, ultimately receiving my
medical degree from Tufts College in 1937. Once again there
was little choice but to continue with postgraduate studies, and
this was accomplished by internship for one and a half years in

the Boston area, which was convenient, because my wife prac-
tised Jaw in this city. My election to concentrate in the field of
orthopaedic surgery (I find that I adhere to the use of the AE

'n that word, probably because of my previous deep grounding

n the classics at the old Boston Latin School) again threatened

o control the course of my next four or five years, but first I

elt inclined to answer the call from the Government for reserve

fficers to volunteer for a year of active duty. Life at Fort
Yevens in 1940 and 1941 Offered a deluding picture of military
<istence, because regular hours of work, ample time for dining
1d dancing at the Officers’ Club, and the exhilaration of being
itt of the mass military movement made me feel that life was
ite pleasant after all. Surgery was practised in a gentlemanly
shion, with night calls only once a week, and complete control
er patients who were required by regulation to remain in
ur ward for a full six weeks after a simple hernia repair.
When my year was up and I packed my bag to pursue my
dies, the Pearl Harbor thing was already brewing, and when
oiled over, I unpacked my bag. For five weeks I helped de-
d the shipyards at Quincy, Massachusetts, from air attacks,
jering medical service to anti-aircraft-men who never did
ally receive their ammunition, and then we moved to the
-hwest Pacific. That went on until I was knocked out of

nn late in 1944, and J finally left the Army early in 1946. My
loving wife joined the WAAC and then the WAC late in

[ 1003 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

1942, and she almost managed to outrank me while she sat in a
swivel chair in Washington. What she regrets most is wilfully
cancelling her orders to proceed with haste to the Southwest
Pacific late in 1944, when I had already arranged to spend leave
with her in Australia; she heard that I was coming home and
she got cold feet.

Our Army service has provided us with everlasting memories,
but there followed four wonderful years of almost pure academic
existence, learning my new trade in New York City, studying
the insides of all the theatres and restaurants in that fascinating
city, and finishing with a fellowship in Europe under the auspices
of the Royal College of Surgeons in London. This afforded
Sylvia and me a great opportunity to study and evaluate pre-
viously strange peoples before settling down to work and live
with the people we had always known. Like the economist who
has felt the pulse of finance in many lands, I have had my hands
inside the hip joints pf Englishmen, Frenchmen, Germans, Swiss
and Italians. And I have learned that under the skin we are all
brothers. In England you can drink scads of whiskey because
it is low proof. In France you can learn how to make home-
made Cointreau. In Italy, little children will drink Cinzano in-
stead of Coca-Cola.

I have been practising and enjoying orthopaedic surgery in
Boston since 1950, while my wife toys with the idea of resuming
the practice of law, my daughter designs clothes and other ob-
jects of beauty and my son practises swinging a baseball bat. It
is fascinating to watch these children mature, especially when
you yourself are quite mature in your own right. I have not
yet discovered where my little girl gets her artistic bent, and my
little fellow is so engrossed in archaeology and astronomy that
neither of us is certain in which field he will concentrate when
he enters the College.

Traveling could be my major hobby, but how far can one
travel on a Wednesday afternoon? And so it resolves itself
down to a little golfing, a little photography, a little gardening,
a little carpentry in my basement workshop, and recently I have
begun to study painting, to see if there is a spark of culture inside
me. My political convictions are not firm, and I have wandered

[ 1004 }

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

from one party to the other as each (I thought) presented a

proper program for dealing with the problems of the world and

the problems of the little man at home. When the overall prob-

lem becomes too overwhelming, I forget about it and settle down

to watch how the Democrats and Republicans treat the subject

of Workmen’s Compensation, in which I am deeply interested,
since it is a field which in its broad ramifications affects the wel-
fare of a huge class of insecure persons.

I follow the religion of my family, which is Judaism, and my
wife and I are active in community Jewish affairs. We enjoy
our close association with the Cub Scout movement, the P.T.A.,
and the various other civic activities in which all of us work with
our friends and neighbors toward making the local community
a better place to live while the rest of the world seems to be
falling apart. Three years ago we purchased a big old house
which our friends thought we were crazy to tackle, and which
my clever wife has transformed into a warm, comfortable and
gracious home, where the Cub Scouts can scout and the Brownies
can cook over a campfire without interfering with one another.
Coexistence without too much war.

My hair has thinned, my vision dimmed. My children are
young, the product of an unsettled and delayed generation. I
hope that their first twenty-five years out of college will be as
‘ruitful and stimulating as mine have been, and that they will
1ever be bored, as I have not. We are looking forward sincerely

nd eagerly to this Reunion.

AS I sit down to contribute my chapter to the Class history
under the impetus of persistent proddings by the Committee, the
benefit of a searching review of a quarter of a century of my life
slowly dawns. Two facts are immediately apparent. In retro-
spect, twenty-five years are not a very long period of time, and,
perhaps more revealing, life does not owe me a thing. It has been
an exciting, challenging, rewarding and thoroughly happy interval.
My experience has probably been more normal than that of
most of the Class, less successful than some, and not as spectacular
as many. I can well recall, after the excitement of Commence-
ment week had faded, the gradual realization that, although I was
the proud possessor of a Harvard diploma, no means of livelihood
was in sight. A summer job loading gravel trucks had solved my
immediate problem of how to eat, when through good fortune
rather than good planning an offer came through from Carbide &
Carbon Chemicals Corporation, unit of Union Carbide & Carbon
Corporation. It was a present for my birthday in August, 1933;
and in 1958 I shall be celebrating concurrently twenty-five years
as a member of the Class and as an employee of Union Carbide
Corporation. While at the time I considered myself an embryonic
production wizard, they quickly changed the illusion by assigning
me to the sales department. This has been my area of develop-
ment. I need only add that the long association has been both
happy and rewarding, and I am convinced it would have been
difficult for me to have selected a career I might have liked better.
While I now am a member of the Bakelite Company organiza-
tion, my association with the plastics interests of Union Carbide
has been continuous from the start. I have enjoyed the somewhat
unusual opportunity of growing up with and contributing to a
new basic industry as it has matured and expanded rapidly into all
phases of our economy and our personal lives. The plastics indus-
try still maintains its vitality and capacity for growth, and I hope
it may be my good fortune to stick with it for many years to come.
I can wax equally enthusiastic about my family, with a wife
who understands me and insists on pampering me because she is

[ 1006 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

sure I work too hard, As will be noted from the vital statistics

detailed above, I can be expected to know little about raising

girls, but do feel I am gradually becoming experienced in the

problems associated with boys. The oldest is in his second year

away at school (Eaglebrook, Deerfield, Massachusetts) and at this

stage I carefully avoid running the extension on the cost of
educating them all as we would like to do it. Only one has
matured to the extent that positive interests have emerged. He
holds an Eagle rank in scouting and is determined to be an elec-
tronics engineer. As college is still a little remote, it is early to
predict how many Harvard applicants we may have.

My personal activities are, of necessity, tailored to the demands
of a commuting and traveling business schedule. My work takes
me to the principal industrial cities of the United States, and I
have not taken time to explore the world outside these borders.
[ did not even have the benefit of wartime travel at government

egational Church and am inclined to supply the loyal

ve served for a number of years. During this time I have run

o
tion from implementing the restoration of the lovely old

am sure a complete detailing of my political and social convic-
s would create more words than any of my classmates would

tly only because they have represented the lesser of two evils.

have made this country great. We are gradually betraying our
heritage of hard work, individual initiative, and love of freedom
for an illusion created and sold us by a benign, ineffective, and
horribly inefficient government complex. I am trying hard to
maintain my faith in the democratic principle of majority rule,
but wonder if I will live to benefit from that “equal and opposite

reaction” which Professor Merriman of History I fame assured
us would inevitably develop.

creator of another Madame Bovary succumbed, a long time ago,
to the severe limitations of natural endowment. The transfor-

mations came rapidly, aided by an increasingly sedentary approach

to corporeal exercise and by the very effective mental deflation
of the Harvard Ph.D. program.

I was at least fortunate to obtain the necessary credentials for
college teaching and thus to realize my sole ambition. Changes in
locale were held to a minimum: four years as an instructor at the
University of Illinois, one year as an associate professor at Miami
University and, in 1947, a full professorship at the State University
of New York College for Teachers in Albany, where I expect to
continue until retirement unless forces beyond human control

decree otherwise. Here, the joy of watching youthful minds
acquire learning (sometimes, with a modicum of wisdom) is
enhanced by the fact that students normally become teachers
themselves, schooled not merely in the best aspects of professional
training but also in respect for scholarly attainment. It is a source
of great satisfaction to work with those who will form one very
vital cornerstone of future American civilization.

As with many of us, professional activities were interrupted by
military service. It was first a task of fitting a square head into
a round hole until the assignments of intelligence officer and
command historian made me feel more at home. There are a
Bronze Star and other mementoes of four years of active service
(three in Europe) gathering dust in my study; the greater know!-
sdge of myself, both favorable and otherwise, gleaned from these
‘our years of enforced absence from academic pursuits, became a
yermanent factor in my personal assessment of potentialities.

If the years following graduation have been enriched by positive
esults in the classroom and in literary research, they were made
omplete by periods of study and relaxation abroad, realized with
ne help of a French Government Scholarship, a Harvard Sheldon
ellowship, sabbatical leave and the like, which neither time nor
ioney might have permitted in another profession. Nothing has
ven me, a staunch patriot, more genuine pleasure than attempting
» understand by direct contact the philosophy of other peoples

id, in consequence, to destroy national prejudice and recrimina-
on.

cation. We are, at least temporarily, engrossed in pedagogy of
one sort or another. I should never change, even if a regression

candidly indicates the stupidity of her father in choosing to attend

FAILING to find any demand for embryo geologists in the
summer of 1933, I returned to school for a Master’s degree. In
1934 the employers were still unimpressed. I finally went to work
for the Department of Agriculture making aerial photographic
maps, on the strength of a course in aerial photography which I
had taken for the airplane ride. After a couple of years of that
I transferred to the U.S. Army Engineers and have been doing
engineering geology for that agency ever since that time. My
work has taken me all over the eastern United States, a little of
Canada, the West Indies, and Panama Canal Zone. I have worked
on the St. Lawrence Seaway, many flood-control and power
dams, air bases, harbor facilities, and in very recent years, on
foundations for launching and tracking facilities for guided
missiles,

field trips. We have settled down in an oceanfront house at

Jacksonville Beach. The sun and spray make maintenance a chore,

but we enjoy having the ocean in the front yard.

Our four boys are a pretty normal group. Eddie, the oldest,

is a high school athlete (“All-City” outfielder, fullback on football

team). At the moment he hopes to be a dentist. Dennie, fifteen,

is a radio bug and a collector of assorted fauna (snakes, birds,

etc.). Robbie and Tommie, the Boy Scouts, provide a uniformly

high noise level from 6:00 A.M. until bedtime except for school
hours. They are still at the age when adults are the natural enemy
and I find I don’t know them very well.

Aside from my family and my work, my chief interest is in
sports. Fishing, of the surf and deep-sea varieties, is the only
sport in which I still participate and Dot always outdoes me at
that. I am still a rabid fan of football, baseball, and all the rest.
(How about those Milwaukee Braves?) In intercollegiate sports,
I think the establishment of the Ivy League has been a forward
step. It is now the only major college group where sports (par-
ticularly football) are still played by students, and are kept more
nearly in proper perspective with the rest of college life.

I have no political affiliation. Mr. Roosevelt made me a con-
servative, or at least an anti-“liberal.” The principle of “throw
the rascals out” is a good one in my opinion. I never vote for the
incumbent unless there is no other reasonable choice.

THE man who said that life begins at forty probably knew a thing
or two, and I am inclined to agree with him. Having been born
here in New York, I returned forty years later to take up resi-
dence, and have enjoyed the past seven years immensely. Three
years ago I married Mary Furtick Stocksdale, a southern belle
who, like me, had been married before, and whose home town of
Columbia, South Carolina, I knew from business trips before I
met her here in New York.

My two daughters live with their mother in Pasadena, Califor-
nia. We go out to see them once a year, and soon they will be
coming east to visit us. This is a phase of modern life that one
must learn to live with. My job as sales representative of the
Great Northern Paper Company in five southern states is more
pleasant than arduous, and involves frequent trips down south,
often accompanied by my wife, calling on publishers of southern
newspapers. Many of them have bought their newsprint from
Great Northern for thirty or forty years, and southern hospitality
isno myth. Great Northern is almost as well known to southern-
ers as it is to New Englanders who have gone fishing or touring
in Maine, via the private road over Ripogenus Dam.

Although only a two-year member of Harvard ’33 (I graduated
from Trinity in 1933 along with Joe Frothingham), I have always
felt a strong bond for Harvard, possibly abetted by the fact that
I have two Yale brothers-in-law, and by the fact that my family
has lived in New Haven for thirty years. My father, a staunch
member of Harvard ’98, and retired attorney for the New Haven
Railroad, still lives in New Haven, and at age eighty-three will
regale a roomful of Elis. We were brought up on the story of
what a fine, cultured city New Haven is; the culture is constantly
increasing because every freshman brings a little culture into
town, and no senior ever takes any away!

Modern economics being what they are, my wife chooses to

[ to12 ]

keep her excellent job as co-owner of a small travel agency called
Frederics-Helton in the Empire State Building (advertisement).
Thus we can indulge a predilection to travel, and whereas she has
actually been around the world, I can merely claim to have
touched over the years on every continent except Australia, In
the summer of 1929 I made a trip with Capt. Bob Bartlett on the
schooner Morrissey to Labrador. On two summer vacations from
college I worked as a deck hand for the American Export Lines
and made all the ports around the Mediterranean. As a naval
officer in the war I had duty in Panama and South America, and
then on a naval transport in the Pacific, taking in the islands, the
mainland of China, Korea, and finally Japan. Just recently my
wife and I completed a three-week trip to Europe taking in
Germany and Spain.

Thus travel is likely to be our main avocation over the years.
Being city dwellers, we read a lot and see most of the plays (“My
Fair Lady” twice). To keep the waist line in control there are
squash racquets and skiing in the winter, and in summer swimming
and golf. Actually the days aren’t long enough for the things
we want to do, and weekends in the country with friends and
numerous relatives are a constant temptation. To top it off, we
may become camera bugs with our new Zeiss Contaflex brought

back from Germany!

EXCEPT for a break of four years, I’ve kept to my chosen job
of teaching fairly steadily and happily. The four years’ interrup-
tion for service in the Army, including two years in the Pacific
Area, though not exactly the sort of sabbatical I would have
chosen for myself, made me realize how exacting it had been to
work with children at the junior high school level. Since then I
have taught in the Boston Public Schools and, for the past five
years, at the Bridgewater State Teachers College.

Apart from my interest in literature and education, I try to play
a little tennis. This year I managed to wheeze through just one
session of doubles.

Most important of all, I have fairly recently married. Barbara
and I have two beautiful daughters whose energy and high spirits
amuse and all but exhaust us. We hope, when our family has
grown enough, to do some traveling — perhaps as far as California.

ONE spring day last year I sat on a bench in Florence and decided
that when I retired, here I would like to be, So ever since I have

been plunged into the Renaissance (evenings). Occasionally I
emerge, take a quick look around, and hasten back.

Daytimes I spend running my own publishing house, which
specializes in creating rather fancy books and booklets for in-

dustry. Some of it is much ado about nothing, but much of it is

very satisfying, particularly when we use top design, artists and

writers to translate the intricacies of science to the public. I have
a small office, with a photogenic staff and a flowering terrace, our
clients don’t bother us much, and it is a very pleasant way to earn
a good living. It took several years of sweat to build it up, how-
ever, and many years of experience gained while I labored in the
book publishing vineyards.

Weekends I almost regain my youth when I commute to West-
port and try to keep up with the (literally) breathtaking activities
of my nine-year-old daughter. Summers I have often spent on
Martha’s Vineyard, but in ’58 I am looking forward to what I
hope will be an annual pilgrimage to Bordighera on the Italian
Riviera and thence back to Tuscany. The Association Inter-
nationale des Humoristes, an assembly of European cartoonists,
meets there and they have asked me to edit an annual selection of
their work.

So after all these years, with their moments of ecstasy or bore-
dom or pain, and I have had all three, I find myself as happy as
one can expect to be in this Age of Anxiety, comfortably en-
sconced in a lovely apartment on a favorite street and surrounded
by my records, art books, humor collection and American history
books. I have edited eight anthologies in the humor and short
story fields and have become adept at scissors and paste, I have
been reading a great deal lately on the period of the American
Revolution and I hope that some of my classmates will some day
re-read the giants of that era who grappled with the fundamental
question of that day and this — the relationship between govern-
ment and the individual. They didn’t really come up with the
answer, but they sought deeply. We don’t even try.

In any case, bachelorhood is perhaps too self-indulgent and it
Joesn’t seem natural to me, though it has its obvious advantages.
30 the chances are I shall reasonably soon take up once again the
esponsibilities of family life.

IT was 1934, and in a retail store which was most inadequately

even the first idea), there was an utterly confused, very ungram-

matical “me.” My years of training stood me in good stead,

however, and in no time at all I had made every possible mistake,

and even impossible mistakes possible.

Nearly 25 years have passed and, beginning with that small
corner of confusion, I can list these happy credits. A wonderful
marriage to my college sweetheart, and we are looking forward
to our twentieth anniversary. A very pretty daughter, who is
about to have her Sweet Sixteen party. A fine son who will soon
celebrate his Bar Mitzvah in our local synagogue. As for myself,
I have changed but little. Same size trousers, same size hat. This
isn’t news to Etta. She swears it’s the same hat. My principles,
too, are basically unchanged. I persist in believing, for example,
that in all things (politics, religion, education, merchandising of
every type) the product is the important thing, not the package.

I WONDER how many full-blown biographies are going to
develop out of the tries we are all making to portray ourselves in
a few paragraphs. At any rate, here are a few facts about me
which will bear repetition in drastically altered form if I ever
get around to a lengthier rationalization of my existence.
My field of work is public relations for philanthropic causes,

and I have spent a goodly part of the past twenty-five years in it.
I have been married twenty-one years and have an only cherub
yclept Cynthia. In the last seven presidential elections I voted for
the Democratic candidate. That gives me a record of five winners
and two losers, and Id settle for less on any sunny day at Belmont.

I have never published anything under my own name, but
many a tripping phrase I have fashioned has been uttered by, or
borne the signature of Senator...., Governor... ., and
even Presidents ....and..... To cap this summary, I have
long been a dues-paying member of the American Automobile
Association.

As you see, this narrative allows me to husband for future use a
he intricate diagrams that depict my soul at work. It gives no

-haracter of the activities I pursue. All that will have to wait

UPON leaving college in the spring of 1930, I went to work for
the Gorham Manufacturing Company at Providence, Rhode
Island. My job at that time was in the bronze foundry shovelling
the sand imported from France which was used to make moulds
for the castings used in bronze statues and other bronze archi-
tectural work, and while employed here I had the privilege of
working on the bronze work which now graces the front of
Shreve, Crump & Low Company at 330 Boylston Street in Boston.
It was my plan at that time to do the necessary work at the
Harvard Summer School and return to college in the fall, but
when I returned to Cambridge to find out about being reinstated,
the advice given seemed to be that if you have a job you had
better keep it, as they are going to be very scarce before your
classmates leave college. This no doubt proved to be true, but in
retrospect I consider it darned poor advice even for Harvard.
After a year or so working in a tree nursery, I ended up finish-
ing my education at Bryant & Stratton School in Boston, as jobs
really were getting scarce at this point. I graduated in 1934 from
this institution with many honors and blessings, but no job. So you
can see that I might just as well have gone back to college. After
another stint with the Gorham Company, this time in advertising,

and after selling on the road, packing sample lines for the sales

force, a try at selling food house-to-house (I don’t advise it), the

Armed forces caught up with me in 1942 when I was getting rich

and famous in the boat and engine business (Thos. T. Parker

Company, late of Boston). So I was a “sitting duck” for the US.
Coast Guard in which I served for three years, leaving the
country only once and that was by mistake. (We were blown up
off the coast of Nova Scotia when I was a crew member of a
seventy-foot schooner working out of Portsmouth, New Hamp-

shire.) The rest of the tour of duty was pretty uneventful and
most unheroic.

Oh, yes, I had got myself married just before going into the
service, so when I was mustered out I needed a job and money.
pretty quick; so instead of living happily ever after, 1 went into
the jewelry business, that is, the family business located at the
corner of Boylston and Arlington Streets in Boston, Here I
have been ever since. I am now a vice-president and a director
of the company and do the buying of the silverware. We have
just completed a very thorough renovation job on our new
quarters on the second floor and some new ideas on the street
floor. Like all things today, these alterations took twice as long
and cost considerably more than we had originally estimated,

which makes me think of the education of my children.

My older boy is at the Berkshire School as a first year student
and is probably a better student than his old man; the other two
children are at the Shore Country Day School in Beverly, Massa-
chusetts, along with the sons and daughters of many classmates.

FOLLOWING graduation, I spent a year studying in England
and traveling (in part, with J. C. Campbell) in Western Europe.
The next year I resolved the problem of how to make a living
by postponing it and returned to Cambridge to give Law School
a try. Surviving the three-year siege finally settled the issue,
however, and in 1937 I began practising Jaw in Boston, where,
as number fifty-seven on the roster of the venerable firm of
Ropes, Gray, etc., I had — and enjoyed — the varied fare of the
legal apprentice for five years.

In 1942, I went to Washington as assistant to the chairman
of the Federal Communications Commission and spent the next
two and one-half years fighting the “battle of Washington,”
in particular, one of the hottest Congressional investigations on
record — the Cox Committee Investigation of the Federal Com-
munications Commission.

At the end of 1944, I went to New York City to set up a
law office with Chairman Fly of the Federal Communications
Commission, and I have been at that stand ever since, handling
the usual range of legal problems but concentrating in large part
upon broadcast and other communications matters. Broadcasting,
particularly, is a dynamic field and our work is often challenging

occuPATION: Book business, rare and second hand; general book buyer.
AFTER college, I took my law degree at Boston University,
following the footsteps of my father. Then came brief tussles
with law, advertising and the theatre business. In 1940 I finally
settled down into what is still my career —the book business.
My war service was from F ebruary, 1942, to May, 1946, includ-
ing overseas duty in Hawaii and the Philippines with a radar
battalion. I was discharged as captain.

Upon return to civilian status, I operated the Brattle Book
Shop in Boston until May, 1948, when I joined Goodspeed’s Book
Shop as general buyer. I am still with the same firm and have
found my work and association with George T. Goodspeed,
Class of 1925, to be most pleasant and rewarding.

Family life with two young boys, now aged nine and seven,
and an ever younger wife has been most exciting. I know I
must be younger than I feel or how else could I keep up the
merry pace?

It is most encouraging to me that the reading of good books
has not been superseded by the distraction of the T.V. screen.
[ feel that my small contribution in the purchases and distribu-
‘ion of books has been fully repaid by the appreciation of our
customers, the not so small reading public.

GRADUATION from college was for me only the first step in an
ever-lengthening period of study and training. In the years that
followed 1933, 1 went through medical school (Harvard), medical
internship (at Boston City Hospital), and specialized hospital
work in psychiatry (at Boston State Hospital). Then came the
war, and I spent the next four years as a medical officer in charge
of psychiatric units at several large Army General Hospitals,
acquiring finally the rank of major. During this period I was
certified as a specialist in psychiatry by the American Board
of Psychiatry and Neurology. This, however, represented the
completion of only the second step of my post-graduate studies.
While I was in military service my interest in psychoanalysis
had grown steadily. I felt that psychoanalysis represented both
the most advanced knowledge of the workings of the human
mind and the best techniques of treating emotional illness, Train-
ing in this specialty within a specialty was not possible until I
left military service in 1946. The third step in the course of my
studies —a giant one — began at that time at the Boston Psycho-
analysis Institute. Crowded arduous years followed. My workday
schedule ran from early morning until late at night. Most of the
day was spent at my job as assistant chief of neuro-psychiatry at
the Veterans Administration Hospital in Framingham; late in the
afternoon I would return to Boston for my personal analysis.
Among other things, fighting the Worcester Turnpike traffic
daily gave me material for reflection on the couch. Evenings
were taken up with psychoanalytic seminars, clinical conferences

and case discussions, (Yes, I saw my family weekends.) The third
step was completed when I became a member of the Boston
Psychoanalytic Society and an accredited psychoanalyst. Sub-
sequently, I joined the American Psychoanalytic Association.
While my schedule has become somewhat less strenuous, it is
full enough. For some years now, I have divided my tume between
the private practice of psychoanalysis (in Brookline), teaching of
medical students, medical and psychiatric house officers, writing
of scientific articles, and research. The fourth step? It’s in the
direction of trying to discover more about the complex relation-
ship between the mind and the body, between emotional factors
and physical illness. Hopefully, this research will continue in the
years ahead. ;

It hasn’t been all work, though. My wife, two sons and I
spend every August in Truro, Massachusetts, on a wonderful bit
of wind-swept, ocean-sprayed sandy shore. In my spare time I
play chess, the violin, and do a fair amount of fishing with my sons.

As I try to reflect on the years at college, a host of memories

of those “carefree undergraduate days” arise. I still remember
the jolly trips on the “EI” from Boston to Cambridge daily, the
high social life at the Phillips Brooks House where commuters
ate their lunches, and those light-hearted hours at Lehman Hall
arranging for payment of the next semester’s tuition. I am sure
that others have similar recollections of those trying times during
she years of depression. Speaking for myself, I feel a sense of
sratitude for the considerable help the College (and Jater the
Medical School) gave me. One of my hopes is to make it possible
‘or my two sons not only to obtain the best of educations, but also
o taste to the full all the other pleasures and satisfactions that
tarvard has to offer.

IT is generally accepted that employment opportunities were
not plentiful in 1933 and it didn’t make too much difference if
you didn’t quite know what you wanted to do. After prad-
uation I just drifted from one temporary job to another wher.
ever I could find one. I worked as a meat cutter, pay roll
accountant and legal investigator.

Not getting anywhere fast, as they say, I decided to study law,

evenings. I entered Boston College Evening Law School in
1935. This seemed to be a very wise thing to do. After all, I
wasn’t making any headway in anything and the study of law
would be helpful to the extent that I could at least know if I
were within my rights in not getting anywhere. Besides this,
there was the economic fact present that I wasn’t earning enough
money to enjoy life in the way that a young man of twenty-four
would like to enjoy it. Law school would occupy my evenings
to advantage and I would be developing myself at least, while
I couldn’t be spending money which I didn’t have, to do the
things I thought I would like to do. My father’s demise in 1937
virtually ended my law pursuits. As I look back now, it is
clear that this need not have been the case if I had been seriously
interested in the pursuit of law. However, I quit law school
thinking that I was only temporarily postponing it.

From that point on I worked as a legal investigator until
World War II commenced and the President sent me his greet-
ings to join his official military family. During my service in
the Army I served as a celestial navigation trainer operator,
agent in the Counter Intelligence Corps and as a vocational coun-
selor. I didn’t see any action overseas because of a back injury
but my education was involuntarily furthered because I was
sent to the highest ranking military schools for celestial naviga-
tion, counter-intelligence and vocational guidance, In the time I
spent in the Army, I suffered the usual indignities and restrictions
that are inflicted on enlisted personnel and, of course, indulged

[ 1026 ]

in the activities and abandon that seem to be reserved for enlisted
men only.
After discharge from the Army in 1945, I obtained a position
with the Veterans Administration as a training specialist han-
dling the training of veterans with neuropsychiatric disabilities.
It was here that I met my future wife in 1950, and in 1951 we
were married. Even though my work at the Veterans Admin-
istration was very interesting and satisfying and at times excit-
ing because of the special type of cases I was handling, I must
confess that I was more than ready to resign when I received
the offer of employment for my present position, Mayor John
B. Hynes, whose candidacy for mayor I had espoused in 1949,
called me in November, 1950, about a year after he took office,
and offered me the position as director of Urban Redevelopment.
Urban Redevelopment is a new program authorized by the
federal government in 1949 for the clearance of slums and the
redevelopment of our urban areas, The program is administered
locally with the federal government paying two-thirds of the
cost. Needless to say, I accepted the position. Since then T have
iterally worked my “head off,” but I really believe that I have
ound what I wanted to do and I am reasonably sure that my
cnowledge of this subject is equal to the average at least of my
olleagues in this field in other cities of the country. It is an
xtremely complicated activity by nature of the federal relation-
rips, federal and local legislative requirements, and progress is
ow. I am in constant consultation with top-level planning con-
tants, engineers, realtors, appraisers, market analysts, financial
-ople, federal officials, civic leaders and local officials and office-
ders. |
A typical project involves thirty or forty acres of land in
3 inner core of a city, the displacement of three or four thou-
id families, the acquisition of eight or nine hundred parcels
real estate and several million dollars of real estate acquisition.
e very nature of this type of operation requires extensive plan-
g for the acquisition, demolition and clearance, relocation of
ilies, site preparation, re-use and disposition of the cleared
1 for the new uses.
' goes without saying that any program which displaces sO

y families and affects the property rights of so many people

[ 1027 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

would be obviously regulated by adequate local and federal laws.
These legal requirements, plus the federal regulation, in addition
to the enormous public relations job indicated, add up to only
one thing — ulcers unlimited. So far I have been fortunate, but
I am and have been losing my hair quite rapidly and what hair
remains is becoming gray fast. At best, although very interest-
ing, this is a thankless job. It seems that no one is pleased. The
general public and the civic groups are in favor of the program
but they can’t see why it takes so long to carry out a project.
The people living in the slum, substandard or decadent areas
are, of course, opposed to the idea. The minister loses his flock,
the storekeeper loses his patronage, the politician loses his baili-
wick, the slum landlord loses his high rate of return on his invest-
ment and the inhabitants lose their habitat which they are afraid
to leave.

In short, it is an extremely challenging assignment, unequalled
in opportunities for growth and knowledge and in spite of the
headaches I love the job and intend to stay with it unless my
head rolls off because of the cumulative effect of all the antag-
onisms created.

Hobbies? After taking work home and appearing before social
and civic groups on many evenings, | don’t have much time for
hobbies except to play with my five-year-old son and two-year-
old daughter, before they retire and on weekends.

AFTER numerous unjustified postponements of getting to this
Report, I finally realized that I was shying away from the task,
because it gave me the subtle, but real, feeling that I was engag-
ing in a “do-it-yourself obituary,” premature as I hope it is.
However, inasmuch as it has been acceptable policy to speak
well of those who have gone on, except in politics, I shall not
e too unkind to myself should there be a choice.

In September, 1933, I left the protective Hub of All Things
Worth While, after having spent my entire life in Boston, and
regan the study of medicine at the College of Physicians and
surgeons in NewYork City. This change of geographical loca-
ion also marked an even sharper change in the required time
nd effort necessary to master the mountains of material in the
urriculum. J must admit that this was a radical about face
‘ter four very easygoing and pleasant years at Harvard. The
rious phase took over and, as far as I can see into the future,
is to hold. After the usual four years at medical school, I spent
ur and one-half years at various hospitals in training, most of
hich was at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. This
stitution is noted not only for the high level of attainment in
dicine, but also for the fact that its leaders for the most part
> Harvard men. That may be saying the same thing twice.

[ 1029 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

I was in practice for about a year and then, because of the
fracas that was called number two in the series of world wars,
J joined the Air Force. For the following year, I enjoyed the
well advertised advantages of living in Florida and California.
This era came to an end when I was assigned to a general hospital
in Texas which moved to England as a unit in the early months
of 1944. My experiences with this organization were most re-
warding and after eighteen months I moved on to Germany in
the Bad Nauheim area for a tour of duty. When this was over,
I headed back to England and, eventually, back to the United
States. I am genuinely grateful that I had productive assignments
and that my exposure to hazard was minimal.

In 1941 I was married to June Colen who has put up with my
idiosyncrasies over the years in a manner well beyond the call
of duty. We have a plenitude of common interests the most
important of which is our son, John, who has reached the mature
age of eight years. He is at the Buckley School in New York,
and has drawn a sharp bead on Harvard. I hope he makes it.
We spend our summers at Sorrento on Frenchmen’s Bay in
Maine, where my wife finds many scenes to paint, where my son
finds endless interests on the water and where I play golf and
fish from sun up to sun down. In the course of the fall we get
about five weekends of enthusiastic upland game and duck shoot-
ing with or without limit in the bag. During the last few
years we have again tried out our old skis and at the end of
March we head up to Vermont for a week or so on the novice
slopes. I come back to the city with a multitude of physical
complaints but the brain has been brushed clean of its spasms.

Since the war, practice, hospital work and teaching have filled
the days very completely. The challenge of a baffling case and
the successful accomplishment of the cure of a difficult situation
help neutralize the irreversible problems. The stimulus of the
new developments in the field of medicine is never-ending and
the rewards are rea] because they are concerned with aid to
man. One can not ask for any more, in spite of the fact that
the newspapers tell us that our children shall have the moon for

a playground.

During undergraduate days I planned to enter the business
vorld. The Great Depression and other factors helped change
1y mind. Instead of heading towards Wall Street, I accepted
teaching position at the private school from which I had grad-
ated. Thus began my life’s work in the field of education. My
ureer has been a roving one. Until 1945 I stayed in the New
ngland states. Then I took the advice of a friend who said,
don’t be afraid to move some distance away.” An opportunity
take a position in Maryland came. From that state it was a

ort hop to a position with the National Education Association
Washington, D.C.

[ 1031 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

For six years I was associated with the National Commission
for the Defense of Democracy through Education, a part of
NEA. We were a “fire-fighting” trouble-shooting outfit: set
up to defend the cause of public education against unjust attacks.
We investigated many “fever spot” communities where teachers
had been fired for no apparent good reason or where unethical
school practices had destroyed teacher morale. One of my re-
sponsibilities with the commission was to collect information
on the activities of extremist groups that attacked public schools
and passed it along to school officials. During the height of the
Communist “scare” this work became especially significant be-
cause many extreme right-wing groups used the Communist
issue to try to persuade the American public that the schools
and colleges were loaded with subversives.

When the pressures subsided, I felt the need for getting into
something which had a positive, constructive approach. I shifted
within the NEA, therefore, to membership promotion. For the
past two years I have spent nearly seventy percent of my time
traveling over the United States speaking to teacher groups.
Those of you who travel or have traveled extensively know
what I mean when I say, “I’ve had it!” A wonderful experience,
yes. But, my, oh my, what it does to one’s home life! It isn’t
good for ulcers, either. Now I am in Los Angeles, having ex-
changed the toils of travel for a stationary position which will
be challenging, to say the least.

As I write, I am thinking of the very pleasant afternoons which
John Gowan, my college roommate, and I spent with friends
of his. We haven’t seen much of each other since graduation,
but here we are together again. New England doesn’t seem so

far away.

EDGAR ALLAN POE wrote tales of horror and despair. I’m
no Poe, but to me, my tale might well be considered in the same
category. For that reason chiefly, I have been so hesitant to
get to it. What produced activity on my part was the threaten-
ing follow-ups I have received from the committee. As the
king in Alice’s Adventure said: “give your evidence... and
don’t be so nervous or I’ll have you executed on the spot.” So
sayeth “King” Don Sullivan and his entourage. Hence, here it
is, such as it is.

After college I attended law school, was graduated with an
LL.B. degree, luckily passed the Pennsylvania Bar examinations
the first try, and was admitted to practice. Law school was the
usual uneventful grind. Except for making the Law Review of
the University of Pittsburgh, nothing else happened. To please
a wonderful, hard-working, sacrificing father, I opened an office
for private practice in McKeesport.

With the entry of the United States into World War II, an

I was never able to pass a physical for a commision in any branch

ONCE upon a time — my, where did that 25 years go? —a de-

to work toward another degree. One year later, armed with an
S.M. in E.E., I again emerged and gladly accepted a job in the

Electric. Two years later, no richer financially than when I
started but far ahead personally (add one wife, native of afore-

gave us time to rest and prepare for the rigors of a tight schedule.
Coming home on the S.S. Independence (a party ship) resulted
in our resting up at home.

How do you live with a teen-ager and a ten-year-old, They
both wonder if there were telephones, autos, and electricity when
we were young. Seventeen-year-old Doug is an Eagle Scout and an
excellent swimmer having worked two summers as a life guard
and is a letterman on the swimming team at Newark Academy.
In the past three years he has improved so much as a skipper of
“Comets” that the ‘old man” may be demoted to crew next
summer. He still has plans for Harvard and we are not dragging
our heels you may be sure. .

Debbie, the ten-year-old, leads a busy life with Brownics (now
Scouting), ball room dancing, piano lessons and ballet competing
for first place. School, of course, has to be endured. Crewing in
the summer sailing races is her ambition but at 60 Ibs. she can’t
make the weight.

Hobbies? Egged on by the children (but needing little or no
encouragement) my first choice is sailing. This year we sold one
Comet and bought a brand new one named after my wife “Witch
J.” We have had considerable fun with that name along the lines
of “Who’s on first—” As a result of sailing all summer, my w ife
now beats me in golf. Part of the fun of sailing (as a confirmed
do-it-yourselfer) has been the scientific aspects ‘of painting, sand-
ing, polishing and setting the mast, centerboard and weight to
develop the most speed. We live all summer at Highland ‘Lakes,
New Jersey, 40 miles and 1400 feet up from work. The one hour
commuting each way is small price to pay for the pleasant cool
living. During the remainder of the year, we keep busy w ith
P.T.A., Adult “school courses, Scouts and Civic affairs. Once in a
while we get a chance to visit New York City and sce a pliv and
even New England, school vacations permitting.

I STARTED with First National Stores during the summer of
1933, and remained with them just over a year, at which time
I was managing a small store. Next employed by the S. D.
Warren Company, paper manufacturers in Cumberland Mills,
Maine. During a three-year period, I served as an apprentice
in the mill and a few months in the New York office. From
the nearby town of Cape Elizabeth, I met a young lady who
was later to become my wife. In 1937, I became superintendent
of the Finishing Department for the Groveton Paper Company,
Groveton, New Hampshire, until 1941 then returned to S. D.
Warren Company. February, 1942, found me a second lieu-
tenant in the QMC. The Army had not forgotten my pleasant
years of R.O.T.C. at Cambridge. I served with the QMC and
Coast Artillery during the four years of active duty. Left serv-
ice with rank of major. Two and a half years spent stateside
and eighteen months most pleasantly located at HQ, Bermuda
Base Command. Meanwhile, we had been blessed with the births
of two boys, now thirteen and sixteen years of age. Since the
war, with the exception of a few years in the automobile busi-
ness, | have been for the most part in the food business, prin-
cipally with frozen products.

As to hobbies and recreation, our interests seem to be out of
doors. We have been fortunate to have had a lot of skiing during
the past few winters. Needless to say, our sons have long since
passed us at this fine sport, but can still hold on at golf, hunting
and boating that take up the remainder of the year. Politically,
I started as a Republican and remained a staunch one all through

SOME people do not like school, and some people probably
do not like Gloucester; I like both. Following two years of
graduate work, I came back to this high school to teach history
in 1935, and have been here ever since, with time out for service
during World War II.

Running a comprehensive high school of some 1400 boys and
girls may seem to have its drawbacks, vocationally, but it’s never
dull; we’re supposed to turn out everything from accomplished
carpenters, printers and secretaries to Harvard freshmen who
can compete on a reasonable basis with the prep school boys,
and the work does bring its problems. However, Dr. Conant’s
decision to spend two years studying and interpreting the work
of the comprehensive school indicates the worthwhilcness of
solving the problems.

Our young fellow, Gregg, is presently concerned with Little
League baseball, basketball, hockey, football; thank Heaven

he can also spell and write sentences. I hope he likes Harvard,
but after a couple of games we saw this fall, I dunno. On the
other hand, his yardstick may lengthen with the years.

Anna, a Gloucester girl and Sargent graduate, came to New
Mexico, and we were married on the airfield where I was sta-
tioned; the Chaplain was a full-blooded Comanche Indian, which
perhaps explains Grege’s interest in Westerns on the televi-
sion. My wife, who is, in general, a superior athlete, fortu-
nately has not mastered the simple art of putting; consequently
I make up in the summer what she takes away from me in the
winter at bowling.

During the war years I was a student of the Southwest; having
absolutely no math or science background, I was a natural to be
put in charge of engineering training at B-17 and B-29 Trans-
itional Training Fields; fortunately the student officers were apt
pupils, and the programs were successful.

In the few hours left over from schoolwork, I try to take an
interest in local affairs, do some studying and production in
various areas of local history, play good match put poor medal
golf, and think how wonderful the Lord was to give us such
a fine earth to live on.

Religiously, I stay with the Congregational Church of my
fathers, having adventured a little into more liberal pastures;
politically, Gloucester has always been conservative, and I go
along generally with the Republicans for the same reason a
pilot lowers his flaps coming in for a landing.

AS in all similar cases, I find that procrastination has not made
the preparation of this history any easier. In fact each day that
passes makes another idea seem ridiculous and less likely to be
readable for the next twenty-five years. At this point my only
suggestion for future class committees would be that they not use
such readable personal histories as samples for the average non-
professional writer.

My personal history seems to divide itself into four different
categories, The first is that short period of three years after 1933
during which Dean Pound and his staff labored to help me to be a
lawyer and which culminated in graduation from the Law School
and admission to practice in Massachusetts.

Period number two involved my education in the practical ap-
plication of that legal training and development of a small clientele.
The high point of this period was my marriage in 1941, but this
was too soon followed by the suggestion of my “friends and
neighbors” that I lend my talents to the war effort. This period
started with basic training as a “Branch Immaterial” replacement
and Jed me to a Georgia Induction Station interviewing illirerates.
In spite of the obvious advantages of knowing more than my inter-
viewees and free time in Atlanta, I convinced someone to approve
my application for Officer Candidate School. The Army, realiz-
ing the futility of training a lawyer in the Judge Advocate School,
assigned me to the Finance School at Duke University. Then to
compound the felony they retained me as an instructor after,
by Act of Congress, making me an officer and a gentleman, Some
three years later, having accumulated forty-five points, a ¢ap-

[ 1041 J

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

taincy, a position as Director of Disbursing Instruction and a com-
mendation from the Chief of Finance, this period ended with my
promotion to unemployed civilian.

I soon found that four years had changed a lot of things and
when the opportunity came to open a branch office for a bank in
my home town, I took it. This has proved to have been a satis-
factory move with my legal education helping me to hold the dual
portfolio of banking officer and chief trust officer. ‘Thus my post-
college career comes to its next climax at the Twenty-fifth
Reunion.

Prior to the war, as I have said, I was married but my sole
addition to prospect lists for the Class of 1969 (?) arrived after
the return to civilian life. My home life has been centered around
Newton and it seems that I shall continue to be a local small-city
boy until retirement comes along. Occasionally, vacations or con-
ferences have taken me out of this area but generally “Old Cape
Cod” has claimed our free time since the war.

Hobbies of a small town banker seem to be established for him
by the continued requests to take part in this or that community
activity, However, I try to find time to spend with my son in
his growing interests in Y.M.C.A., Cub Scouts and helping him
learn to play the flute. Maybe The Band will still be able to use a
piccolo player named Smith.

Recently one line of a dramatic production reminded me of
Harvard and threw a spotlight on its greatness, “As for all other
things, they are mortal and transient but TRUTH (VERITAS)
is everlasting and unchanging.”

AT the last writing in 1948, we were comfortably ensconced in
Suburbia, both living and working on the fringes of New York
City. Shortly thereafter my work took me to Brooklyn, which,
from our home in White Plains, represented four hours a day of
commuting, the anathema of the suburbanite. So it was with
nterest that we considered an opportunity to move to Vermont,
nd after much discussion, argument and soul-searching, decided
o do so in 1949. We have not regretted it, and are now in the
hroes of settling into and renovating a big old (150 years) house
y a series of five-year programs. Plenty of land (150 acres, with
1e usual “more or less”), mostly wooded, gives plenty of oppor-
inity for working off steam and frustrations, and a fifteen-minute
‘ive to work makes the forty-hour week a reality. We are here
stay.
My principal contact with Harvard is through the Harvard
ub of Vermont, and particularly the School and Scholarship
mmmittee. We are spread so thin in this state, with only two
ndred alumni, that the problem of finding, interesting and

sponsoring candidates for Harvard is a unique and challenging
one. It is also generally a rewarding one.

As I write this, with Sputniks I and II whirling about our
heads, I am deeply concerned, being an engineer, with the phi-
losophy of our educational system, and am convinced that we
must sacrifice many of our indulgences for the sake of our
children’s future. This is at present our biggest job.

MY life and work continue in the same direction but with a

on the colonial architecture of Brazil and was awarded the
National Order of the Southern Cross by the government of that
country. In 1956 I was promoted to the rank of professor of the
history of art by the University of Pennsylvania. Last year I was
appointed honorary consultant in Brazilian and Portuguese Studies
at the Library of Congress and in this capacity I attended the
Third International Colloquium on Luso-Brazilian Culture at Lis-
bon last September. In 1956 I also began an association with the
Henry Francis duPont Winterthur Museum at Winterthur, Dela-
ware, in the field of American civilization, which led me to give a
course for the fellows of that museum at the University of Dela-
ware. In the last two years I have inaugurated courses at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania in the history of furniture and the history
of museums, the latter in association with the director of the Phil-
adelphia Museum of Art. In connection with these courses I have
made thousands of color transparencies which constitute the
largest archive of which I have knowledge for the study of the
decorative arts.

LITTLE did I realize that my field of concentration, “Money

five years after graduation —I am now a director of a bank
and have no money. There is no earth-shaking news to announce
as all my activity has been at the local level. The prominent
items that come to mind include sharing with my good wife
the problems of raising five children, building a business in a
very competitive field, handling many Civic assignments in satis-
factory fashion, shooting a sixty-nine and a hole in one, selecting
the Yankees each year to win the pennant, spending winter vaca-
tions in Florida and Bermuda, riding out a good tour of naval duty,
enjoying the friendship of some people and defending the name
of Harvard deep in Yale territory.

BETWEEN college days and the war, I studied architecture at
Columbia and Harvard Universities, and worked for Coolidge,
Shepley, Bulfinch & Abbott of Boston.

In 1941 and 1942, I practiced briefly on my own, and in May
of the latter year, joined Pan American Airways, Africa, Ltd., as
an engineer. This subsidiary company had been formed just
prior to Pearl Harbor to fly aircraft and supplies from this coun-
try across Africa to the British Eighth Army. I was soon in Kano,
Nigeria, the main stop between Accra, Gold Coast, and Khar-
toum, designing and constructing an air base. After the invasion
of North Africa, the line was militarized, and in early ’43, I joined
the Army Engineer Corps at Accra and went at once to Dakar.
Almost two years were spent in design and construction of air
bases at Dakar, Marakesh and Casablanca. Pre-fabricated hos-
pitals were built of P-go crates, control towers on machine gun
nests. There was little or no equipment to build with, and native
materials and labor were used.

In the fall of ’44, I returned home and was assigned to the
headquarters of the Ferry Division of the A.T.C, in Cincinnati,
which was then taking over military air transport from the com-
mercial carriers. ‘There was a great deal of flying all over the coun-
try, which seemed more picturesque at the time than the ancient
walled city of Kano with its black Mohammedan population or
the Atlas mountains and the Berbers.

I was separated from the Army in ’45, having very much en-
joyed being stationed with my family in Cincinnati. During the

[ 1046 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

last year, I worked with the Preload Corporation in New York,
directing the construction of an oil storage “tank farm” near
Shanghai, for the Chinese National Government. After a year
of commuting, I returned to Boston, where I formed a small
architectural firm.

Our work has followed the general postwar sociological pat-
tern of expansion in housing, industry, school development,
recreation, religion, office space and individual homes. Our busi-
ness is a cyclical one and has taken ten years since it began after
the war to become established so that the work keeps coming in.
Our volume has not been~large but has had awards and caused
some comment in magazines, and exhibits.

For relaxation, I enjoy travel and the out-of-doors. Unfor-
tunately, there is little time or money for the former, except
looking at jobs under construction and meeting committees. I
can, however, thank Uncle Sam for taking me to some mar-
velous spots in the war. I think I enjoy being out-of-doors more
than ever, but am not as passionate about fishing or shooting
birds and beasts as I used to be. Classmate William Nickerson
has given me endless good times and opportunities in bird hunting
— a game which he is learning to do quite nicely.

EIGHT years postgraduate work — seventeen years in practice
of medicine — twenty years of raising children — this, in a cap-
sule, would be my life since ’33. Internal medicine, having the
largest scope of any of the medical specialties, demands hours of
“keeping up” studying difficult to sandwich in between demands
of practice, family, and the seemingly endless list of meetings.
I grow ever wiser learning “more and more about less and Jess” in
my sub-specialty of electrocardiography.

meals are eaten in our community lodge, complete with cook and
helper, Sam Morgan, ’33, and Henry Taylor, ’35 (of cholesterol
fame in case any of you coronaries are listening), are in the group,
as well as a history professor (Princeton ’32), an insurance Big

THE first six years of my life after leaving Harvard were spent —
in a losing battle to earn a living in music during the depression.
Neither teaching (which I did not like) nor dance music arrang-
ing (which I did like) seemed to be what I was cut out for. In the
fall of 1939 I decided the time had come to change horses, mid-
stream or no. I went to Columbia University to take a degree in
library science and then accepted a position in the Music Division
of the Library of Congress. Here I found both my wife and my
career. Thus I can vouch from first-hand experience of the treas-
ures of our national library!

Not long after arriving there, however, my low draft number
came up and I was packed off to Fort Riley to have the experience
of being in one of the last few groups of trainees in the horse
cavalry. Except for my basic training, my subsequent Army
career was a notable exception to what might be expected from
the stereotype of Army personnel classification, Having only the
unlikely skills of librarianship and music, I spent the duration
engaged in either one or the other activity, the last three years as
bandleader of an engineer training center band.

Since my return to the library, I have had a succession of differ-
ent assignments. Now I find myself directing one of the library’s
two cataloging divisions (Descriptive Cataloging), My confrere
who directs the other (Subject Cataloging) is, by remarkable
coincidence, a Harvard A.M. in music of the same year I took
mine, Richard §. Angell. I have found great satisfaction and in-
terest in being a member of the library profession and especially
in being at the profession’s hub in America, the Library of Con-
gress, 7

AFTER receiving my medical degree from Georgetown, I spent
a year interning at St. Vincent’s Hospital in Bridgeport, Connccti-
cut, and two years of residency at Northville, Michigan. It was
during my stay in Bridgeport that I met the girl I was to marry.
Since then we have been blessed with four lovely daughters for
which accomplishment I have been rightfully called “Sultan Sam.”
Having been denied the advantages of co-educational background,
I have hopes of “Harvard daughters” now that some of the depart-
ments permit the entrance of women. There are not many dull
moments for a poor male surrounded and overwhelmed by five
females.

Following the completion of my residency, I entered the ser-
vice of Uncle Sam and after several years was discharged a major.
During my period in service I remained in the United States, in
charge of a section concerned with the treatment of tuberculosis
patients.

In matters of religion, I belong to the Jewish faith and follow
the conservative segment, We are anticipating a great event seen.
On January 17, 1958, the day before my birthday, our number
one girl, Marsha, will celebrate her Bas Mitazvah. The happy
turmoil preceding this event has us all in a state of high excitement.

In reviewing my career in general practice, where perhaps the
financial returns do not equal that of the specialist, I feel that my
learning and understanding of the man as a whole has been most
satisfying and rewarding to me as a person.

As I look back over the past twenty-five years, I can think of
nothing I would have done differently other than general practice
of medicine, aided and abetted by a wonderful wife and kept
youthful by four beautiful and stimulating daughters.

AFTER leaving the College I moved over to the Law School for
three years. Dora Innis White of Providence, Rhode Island, and
I were married in June, 1935. Subsequently, I began practising
law in the firm of Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C. I
had taken the Naval R.O.T.C. course at college and early in
January, 1941, I found myself on active duty as first lieutenant of
a four-stack destroyer operating out of Panama. At this time, our
elder son, Henry, was about a year old. Janet was born in August
of 1941, when I was in the Galapagos Islands,

[ 1052 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

In March, 1942, I was transferred to the Sub Chaser Training
School at Miami, where I spent the better part of a year as a

gunnery instructor. Later I took command of the P. Conzts and
spent some months on convoy duty i in the Caribbean. My next
assignment was commanding officer of the U.SS. Oberrender,
DE 344, which I commissioned and took to the Western Pacitic
where we participated in the Leyte, Lingayen and Okinawa
operations. At Okinawa our ship was severely damaged by a
Kamikaze, as were so many other destroyers and destroy er escorts,
In the early part of the war, Dora made efforts to “follow me
around and was evacuated from Panama with our two children
after Pearl Harbor. As the war progressed, this became less and
less practicable, and she settled down in Providence with her
mother, where our younger son, Dick, was born in 1944. For me,
the war was a very poignant experience, as I am sure that it was
for many of our classmates, involving what amounted to learning
a second profession and becoming thoroughly conversant with,
even though perhaps never completely adopting, the military
point of view, so basically different from the ideas which I had
absorbed at Harvard and during my civilian education. I have
always loved salt water and I found spending several years aboard
ship in a professional capacity not wholly unpleasant, The
aesthetic pleasure of being at sea went far in my Case to atone for
the seamier side of wartime operations.

In 1947 I hung up my shingle and started my own law firm
where I am now ‘practising.

I had always had an urge for public service, and in 1953, when
President Eisenhower came into office, he appointed me a Com-
missioner of the District of Columbia. I served as president of
the Board of Commissioners for three years until April, 1956, and
since then have been back with my law firm, Spencer & Whalen,
engaged in the general practice of law. The president of the
Board of Commissioners is the executive head of the District of
Columbia government, who more or less corresponds to the gover-
nor or mayor. The experience was exhilarating, invelvi ing aw nile
range of problems of unending variety and interest, inte lutiers
integration of restaurants, theatres, hotels, recreation areas and
schools, and a fifty-eight-day transit strike.

Our elder son, Henry, 1s now a senior at Milton Academy with

[ 1053 ]

hopes of entering Harvard next fall. Janet is also in New England
at Concord Academy. Dick is still at day school in Washington.

Hobbies — tennis, sailing, shooting and fishing, For the past six
years we have owned with my brother-in-law a sturdy forty-foot
ketch, Lark, on which we have had many happy family cruises.
Some of the time we have had her on the Chesapeake Bay, which
is a delightful cruising ground in spring and fall, and some of it in
New England waters. In August, 1954, Dora and I and the three
children all rode out Hurricane Carol aboard the Lark in Casco
Bay, Maine, an unforgettable experience. '

Perhaps I should also add as a hobby engaging in civic activities,
At the present time I am executive vice-president of the Washing-
ton Hospital Center, a new 800-bed hospital which at the time this -
is written is just about to open.

I SUPPOSE I must confess to being a horrible example of the
proverbial rolling stone. The longest job I ever held lasted a mere
ten years, and that particular occupation involved frequent moves
from one part of the world to another. I was pushing forty when
I finally settled down and started raising a family, Even now, I
don’t for a moment believe that the Pocket Principality, albeit its
increasingly publicized charms, is the ultimate haven, or that my
present profession is permanent. Who knows, after spending two-

[ 1054 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

thirds of my life in foreign climes, I may yet renounce the status
of expatriate and end up as a solidly entrenched citizen in the land
of my forebears.

I had planned on becoming an architect when I was at college,
but by 1933 it no longer seemed like a good idea. Immediately
after graduation, I joined my parents in England, where my father
was serving as American Consul, and spent a year there doing
graduate work in Durham University, The following year I
Janded a job as clerk in the American Consulate at Havre, where
I remained for five very happy years. I was appointed vice consul
shortly before the war broke out, and was transferred to Port
Said, Egypt, late in 1939. I spent three pretty exciting years in
the Suez Canal area, dodging bombs a great deal of the time. Then
in July, 1942, just when everything seemed blackest, I was sent
back to the States for a brief leave, which was followed by a
year’s assignment in Haiti. I was drafted into the Navy in January,
1944. My quite indistinguished war service, as luck would have
it, took place exclusively in the States, notwithstanding my heroic
vision of myself as a high-powered bilingual secret operative in
France and North Africa. The only comparatively interesting
break in my humdrum Navy career was a stretch as a French
typist and proof-reader at the San Francisco Conference of UN
IN 1945.

I was among those sorely beset by disillusion at the war's end.
The process of demoralization had actually begun some time
before I entered the Navy, when increasing numbers of inex-
perienced men were being brought into the Foreign Service at
higher salaries than the one I was being paid for far more responsi-
ble work. After I was drafted I performed my menial yeoman’s
tasks as cheerfully as I could, but my resentment continued to be
fed by an exasperating conviction that my previously ill-rewarded
Capacities were being thrown away as well. Perhaps TI was too
hasty in my insistence on a drastic, immediate improvement in my
Foreign Service fortunes when, after my discharge in January,
1946, I reported back to the State Department for reassignment.
The outcome was resignation instead. A year in: Washington,
during which I taught French at the Navy Intelligence School,
followed; then an ill-fated attempt to sell myself to Central Intclii-
gence. At this point, overcome by frustration, I headed back to

[ 1055 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

France, with no definite plans beyond a much needed change in
scene and the renewing of old ties.

That was 1947, and I haven’t been back to the States since. I
first spent two leisurely years in Paris, where my best friend, a
Frenchman I'd met in Havre before the war, gave me a roof. I
didn’t do anything very constructive beyond trying to find out
whether [ could become a concert pianist (I couldn’t), or get a
doctorate from the Sorbonne (I didn’t), go to work for Coca-Cola
(it fizzled), the Marshall Plan (no soap), UNESCO (ditto). But
I did succeed in having a wonderful time.

In 1949 I was offered a job as assistant to the Secretary General
of the International Hydrographic Bureau by one of its directors,
an admiral to whom [d taught the rudiments of French at the
Navy Intelligence School. The fact that my parents had just
bought a house in Nice to retire to overcame any hesitations I
may have had in accepting. The IHB ts an intergovernmental or-
ganization boasting thirty-nine maritime states as members (in-
cluding the U.S., of course), although a staff of fifteen suffices to
run it. Its main objective is the “coordination of the work of
hydrographic offices with a view to rendering navigation easier
and safer in all the seas,” a task which includes the issuance of
various hydrographic publications, in both English and French.
This is where my bilingualism comes into use, since I am by no
means a hydrographer. I became the administrative assistant this
year upon the retirement of the Secretary General, who has not
been replaced, but whose administrative duties have devolved
upon me. .

My wife is the young sister of the Good Samaritan who put me
up in Paris back in 1947. She is French, but of Alsatian stock as
her unpronounceable name suggests, I’ve known her since she
was the ripe old age of nine. We have two small, very lively
daughters, and are expecting a third child in March. Certainly
domesticity is one of the rare wise, completely satisfying choices
I’ve ever managed to make. After majoring in geography at the
Sorbonne, my wife got a scholarship to the University of Louisiana
in 1950. Aside from this particular subject, our tastes are pretty
nearly identical, including an overwhelming love of chamber
music (I wish we had room for an extra piano), and a predilection
for literature, the theatre and travel.

[ 1056 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

What shallow roots I may have put down thus scem to he
taking hold in France, where as an American Foreign Service
child, I was brought up in the first place. My children so far speak
only their mother tongue (although we are now trying to intro-
duce a wider use of English into our household), and I feel very
much a part of my wife’s large, wholly delightful family, which
had more or less adopted me years and years ago in Havre. Yet
J am not totally assimilated: like any other American, I find my-
self defending many (not all!) aspects of our way of life, I worry
about the President’s health, about labor bosses, gangsterisim,
Governor Faubus’s attempts to defeat integration, the Russianv
next artificial satellite, and Secretary Dulles’s next gaffe. I hope
my children will be able to go to an American college, and I will
probably feel bound to rally round when the next Crisis Comes.
All this doesn’t necessarily mean that I could painlessly readape
myself to life in the U'S., I realize, yet I’m still game to try.

My four years at Harvard are by far the pleasantest recollection
of my scattered fifteen years’ sojourn on American soil. Various
classmates I’ve run into in odd spots of the world have helped to
keep the memory fresh: Stratton Anderson had the desk next to
mine at the Havre Consulate in 1937, and Oscar Holder was mv
replacement at Suez in those critical days in 1942. There have
been brief encounters with others, and permanent contacts with
one or two.

I would give a great deal to come back, if only as a temporary
visitor. Alas! I don’t think the present family fortunes will stand
even the valid excuse of the Twenty-fifth Reunion. But I shall be
there in spirit.

SAGES have told us youth is a time for looking ahead, age a
time for looking back. But they have neglected to answer: what
is middle life a time for? Lacking guidance from the wise, and
extrapolating the unknown quantity from the two knowns, we
arrive at one solution: a time to savor the present.

To this gourmet of the here and now, the good things as to
many men, move on two planes. One is my family, with frisky
kids who, as the sages say, are looking far forward — on lines
leading to the right and left banks of the Cambridge Common.

The other is career, for six years basic research in the frontier
field of social psychiatry. Two volumes done with my associates
and reporting first results are moving from night-shift composing
toward delivery to the publisher in the spring. .

With a bow to actuarial and international risks, tomorrow will
hopefully bring more of the same.

IT must be very interesting.” “Yes, it certainly is.” Not long
after this the conversation usually drifts to other topics. That's
the way it was with Joe Smith at the Twenty-fifth. It has always
been difficult for me to convey to someone in another line just
what it is like to work for an educational foundation.

“It must be wonderful just to give money away!” Joe said.
“Well, it’s very satisfying, of course,” I replied, as I had so
many times before, and added, “You must realize, though, that
you are disappointing people much more than half the time.”

“T suppose you have a lot of requests.” “That's right, I am cast
more often in the role of Scrooge than of Santa Claus. You
must understand that there is a lot more to this business than
simply separating the incoming wheat from the chaff, making
a series of arbitrary judgments. You see, we have certain things
We...

Here, Joe’s eyes became a trifle glassy and he eyed his glass.
“You have any children?” he managed. “Yes, two little girls,
eight and six. What about you?” “Oh, our eldest boy is out
of college and the others are about to finish high school.”

“I really belong to a different generation now,” I related. “You
see, I didn’t get married until after the war. They drafted me
into the Field Artillery in 1941, before I had done anything about
it — effectively, that is. I put in five years, three of them in
England in personnel and then historical work with the Air Force.
When I got back, I discovered a primary objective, established
an operating policy, and in August, 1946, implemented it success-
fully. Now, my wife, Mary, and I live in Connecticut, take the
station wagon to the supermarket, school and committce mect-
ings; the jeep to the station and into the woods. We have tcle-
visions and martinis and flu shots—and flu—and pretend
we're just a little different from the stereotype. A pleasant and
busy life.”

What is it you say you do? Your job, I mean,” Joe said

‘T’m in the foundation business,” I answered. “You know, Rocke-
feller, Ford, only it’s Carnegie Corporation.” “That must be very
interesting.” “Yes, it is.” “How do you get into that sort of
thing?” “Well, there is no set path. For most people it’s an un-
foreseen development. In our outfit, which is relatively small in
staff size — though not in endowment — most of the officers have
come out of university teaching or administration since our main
business is with higher education. You may remember that after a
couple of years of history teaching at Governor Dummer Acad-
emy, I went back to Harvard to be secretary to the President for
three years. Then, in 1938, I became a baby dean in charge of
juniors and seniors and student activities, This was considered
something of a dead end street as there was little provision for
deans who had reached puberty. Late adolescents were not en-
couraged. The opportunity to go to New York in 1940 came
quite as unexpectedly as the opportunity to go to the 34th Street
Armory a year later.”

Joe was looking toward the bar. “Where do you live, Steve?”
“In Connecticut, New Canaan. If you’ve read the Bible you
know ——” “That must be nice. I suppose you do a lot of
traveling.” “Besides two hours a day?” “Well, I have in the last
three or four years. You see, I am responsible for the only for-
eion operations of Carnegie, that is, a program of grants for
educational development in certain areas of the British Common-
wealth. I go frequently to Canada and, in 1955, spent two months
visiting universities in Australia and New Zealand. Last year I
spent about the same period in South, Central and East Africa
and was fortunate enough to have my wife along for part of the
time.” “That must have been interesting.” “Having my wife?”
“No. I mean don’t they have a lot of problems?” “Oh, yes. We
try to help the newly established universities in Africa to meet
some of them. We also bring over on travel grants about sixty
teachers and administrators a year from these countries to look
into new developments in their fields here.” “I’m sure that’s
very useful,” Joe said. “By the way, do you have any children?”
“Yes, indeed, two lively girls, eight and six.” “That’s fine. I
have boys. One’s finished college.” “Gee,” I said, “you're in a
wholly different gener-----. Let’s have another drink.” -----

“. . . because it’s not just sitting back evaluating proposals.

There is a chance to play an active and creative role, to encour-
age development of new ideas in education. To me this is the
most stimulating part of it.” “TI do like stimulation,” said Joe.
“Do you get any time for anything else?” “Oh sure. I spend
weekends working around the place doing some reading. Also, I'm
a fairly serious beginner at the piano along with my eldest daugh-
ter. Lately ve become something of a Civil War fan. You
know, it’s fascinating. Clearly McClellan should never have

gineering jobs of relatively short duration. These included being
a surveyor for the District of Columbia Highway Department,
a computer for the Coast and Geodetic Survey and a technical
writer for the Department of Labor. In the fall of 1937 I re-
turned to Harvard for a year’s graduate work at the Bureau for
Street Traffic Research (since moved to Yale),

In 1939 I began working for the Capital Transit Company in
the Research and Planning Department. This company operated
the local street car and bus transportation in Washington and
neighboring Maryland. During the seventeen years that followed,
I witnessed the complete rise and fall of an empire. Emerging
from the dark years of the middle ’30s, Capital Transit did a splen-
did job of expanding to meet the needs of the war effort, nowhere
a bigger problem than in the Washington area. The company
became one of the outstanding transit companies in the United
States, was winning awards for safety and for maintenance and

[ 1062 |

was recognized as a leader in the industry. (We would like to
think that some of our planning contributed to this state of af-
fairs! )

After the war, riding began to fall off sharply as automobile
expansion resumed its prewar pace. Capital Transit, like other
properties in the industry, was caught in the spiral of higher
costs, slower speeds due to congestion, higher fares and declin-
ing passengers. About this time Louis Wolfson gained control.
In an attempt to keep outgo in line with income, he instituted
policies and economies which were unpopular. The climax came
in the summer of 1955 in the form of a fifty-one-day strike, when
Wolfson refused to yield to the union demands. Congress exer-
cised its wrath by canceling the franchise on one year’s notice.
In December of 1955, the Planning Department was disbanded,
as the company no longer had anything to plan for.

I decided to leave the traffic field and took a position at the
National Bureau of Standards in the Data Processing Systems
Division. I] am now busy learning the whys and wherefores of
electronic computers.

The Bureau of Standards, in addition to doing pure research
in the basic sciences, acts in an advisory capacity to other gov-
ernment agencies. During these past two years there, most of
my efforts have been devoted to a research and development
project aimed at mechanizing the sorting of letter-size mail by
the Post Office Department. It is planned that addresses would
be read by a coder who would punch keys to reduce the address,
causing a dot code to be imprinted on the envelope. The letter
would then be fed into a sorting machine where photo-electric
eyes would read the dots and an electronic memory would de-
termine into which bin to sort the letter.

The project has led to some travel to observe existing methods
in post offices in the United States. This has included a trip to
the west coast and several trips to Ottawa to consult with
Canadian officials responsible for a generally similar mechaniza-
tion development in that country. Furthermore, a trip to Furope
is planned in the near future to inspect developments in several
foreign countries.

An area in which I have specialized is the development of a
suitable address code — one which can be applied casily by the

[ 1063 ]

coding operators but which will be, at the same time, relatively
free of duplication.

I have become indoctrinated in programming for an electronic
computer. I have done my own programming for an IBM-704
in order to analyze letter sequences and test code plans as ap-
plied to the 38,000 post-office names in the United States. It is
a real thrill, after one has spent many weeks writing and “debug-
ging,” to have a complex program finally work on the computer.

Another phase of my present effort relates to the use of com-
puters in the traffic field: how to work up voluminous data
from origin-destination traffic surveys; how to predict future
traffic flows; and how to stimulate traffic situations so that cer-
tain parameters can be varied to obtain optimum results without
upsetting motorists by actually making changes on the street.
These applications of computers to traffic problems are a rel-
atively new development. Supposedly having turned away from
traffic, I find myself headed back to it again and have the pleasure
of being thrown back with many of my earlier traffic associates,
now as a computer man instead of a traffic man.

Principal hobbies are bridge, chess, bird-watching, “hi-fi” and
amateur home repairs in an attempt to keep our large old house
from falling down on us. Increasingly in recent years duplicate
bridge and chess have given away to more domestic activities:
working with Cub Scouts, shuttling the children around to their
dance classes, piano lessons and parties, and being active as a
charter member and head usher, 1953-56, of the Unitarian Church
of Montgomery County. Looking back on my chess record,
however, I have been able to win the Washington area champion-
ship six times in the period 1935 through 1952, and in 1951 in-
vaded the South to win the Southern Chess Association’s annual
event held that year in Asheville, North Carolina.

For a number of years we have spent our summer vacations
on Lake Keuka in the Finger Lakes section of western New York
State. With my wife’s family and relatives living in and around
Washington Court House, Ohio, our family travel consists of
periodic triangulation between Ohio, Lake Keuka and Washing-
ton, D.C.

AFTER a postgraduate sojourn at Pinckney Street and later
Smith Court, where the wind whistled through our bachelor
house and our earliest riser, Mac Farmer, the only Eli in the group,
was prevailed upon to stoke the furnace at grey and cheerless
dawn, I moved back home to Longmeadow. This was after
leaving my first job with the National Rockland Bank to go with
Whiting, Weeks & Knowles. Our Class, certainly, was tossed on
the barren fields of the worst depression. Later I moved to Hart-
ford and the Aetna Life Insurance Company investment depart-
ment and then to the Hartford National Bank & Trust Company
(fourth oldest bank in the country) in 1947.

This was an epic year for me, becoming engaged and married,
and, as events proved, the era of my greatest accomplishment,
converting from bachelorhood to the father of four within two
years. Other classmates may challenge the record. We have
lived in Farmington since and consider ourselves fortunate to be
situated in this historic and lovely valley.

While I had for years gone to the Cape for summer vacations,
my wife since childhood had gone to Fishers Island; accordingly,
we reached a fair compromise and I find myself at Fishers Island.
Also, I play a great deal more golf than tennis, for the same reason,
sail at any given opportunity, swim always, and right now am a
little stiff from touch football with the twins. This is a far cry
from the cricket fields of Chefoo and the annual “long run” when
thirty-odd boys, cleanly clad in white flannels, raced across the
countryside past the Baby Towers to the Black Dragon Mon-
astery. This was the year that the fleeing army of Wu-Bei-Fu,
pushed into the sea by the old Manchurian war lord, Chang-Tso-
Lin, grounded its troopships on the beaches in front of the school.
Not long afterwards Japanese destroyers were scouting the coast.

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

THREE years (spent on my Columbia degree) after graduating
from Harvard, my formal education and bachelorhood were over
and the end’ of an eight-year engagement began a three-month
honeymoon in Durango, Colorado, where my wife and I, both
interested in archaeology, excavated, visited ruined pueblos,
fished and enjoyed the West’s matchless scenery.

Back to Birmingham in the fall of 1936 — architectural dol-
drums heavy. Associated with D. O. Whilldin and shortly saw
that at least this part of the world (wisely) was not receptive
to my gifts of “modern” architecture.

In 1942, I went with the Army in civilian capacity and, as
architect-in-charge, completed the Third Air Support Command
Base, at Eastaboga, Alabama. Unable to find an apartment at
nearby Anniston, my wife, son and I stayed in two rooms, with-
out plumbing, on a farm. Primitive quarters and the winter baths
in Coldwater Creek are memorable.

Having seen enough of the Army, I applied for a commission
in the Navy and received my j.g. in June, 1943. Indoctrination
and instruction in recognition at Ohio State were followed by
duty as an instructor in recognition at various Naval Air Stations
from Florida to New Jersey. Wanting overseas duty, I nagged
my way into Carrier Air Group 153, ‘but V-J Day came along
before embarkation. With insufficient points for release to in-
active status, I was assigned to the staff of the commander of
the Air Force, Atlantic Fleet as assistant to the training and gun-
nery officer. Most interesting of duties there was my assignment
as historian of that department, Naval logic apparently selecting
me on the qualifications of new arrival and complete ignorance
of the department’s past.

On my release to inactive duty, as lieutenant, in January, 1944,
I returned to Mr. Whilldin, where I remained until January, 1954,
at that time going with Lawrence Whitten, Architect. In June,
1955, I moved to Charles H. McCauley, Architect, where I am
now in charge. of public housing. My home aw ay from home ts
literally that, since I spend at least fifty hours a weck there.

We enjoy vacations from Florida to New Efampshire, but
usually settle for the Gulf — one or two naps a day, fish or sw in
as we wish, or just wiggle our toes in sand so fine it squeaks when
you walk on it.

In spite of my proselytizing, my elder son chose the University
of the South, at Sewanee, Tennessee, where he is completing
his last year as a biology major. A top student in his field, he is
also a member of the Blue Key (national honor society), the Red
Ribbon, past vice-president and now president of the student
body and in Who's Who in American Universities and Colleges.
The younger boy is also a good student, with all A’s on his last
reports, ability with a pencil and the build of a future football
player.

An ardent hobbyist, my interests include the Paleo-American,
Coleoptera, American antiques, mysteries and spelunking. A mod-
est orchid range takes a good amount of my time and I occasion-
ally find the leisure to listen to classical recordings, especially
Brahms.

I’m by no means unscarred by the years, but there is little loss
without compensation; recession of the hairline has been count-
ered by advancement of the bulge and what I have sacrificed in
starches and sugar I have gained in larger and more frequent
doses of Bisodol.

PUBLICATIONS: Regular contributor of articles to a number of scientific
journals and books, dealing with results of original research on general
subject of the biochemistry of proteins and amino acids.

IN a recent issue of the publication Science, two anthropologists
reported the results of an extensive questionnaire that had been
presented to a large group of high school students with the pur-
pose of learning how they felt about science and scientists. The
results were disquieting. Most seemed to feel that a scientist had
to be a bit “queer,” a genius who was precluded by the nature of
his profession from leading a “normal” life. In this age with its
accent on conformity, such an evaluation is a kiss of death and
doubtless is one reason why able youngsters are no longer at-
tracted to science as once they were. I am grateful that no such
mythology was current when I was in school and college, or I
might have missed a life that has offered great satisfactions and
rewards (not pecuniary, I hasten to add — it’s true what they say
about academic salaries — support that program for Harv ard Col-
lege!).

After leaving Cambridge I came to New York to pursue
graduate studies in the department of biochemistry, College of
Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, and received the
Ph.D. degree late in 1937. This degree is supposed by many to
mark the holder as a member of the community of scholars.
Actually a Ph.D. seems to me to be little more than an intellectual
hunting license. At this point one has simply acquired (if one is
fortunate) the basic tools that permit learning to procecd in
earnest. In my case the next step carried me to the Rockefeller
Institute, where, although I didn’t realize it at the time, I was
destined to remain. I began as a collaborator of a distinguished
investigator, Dr. Max Bergmann, who had been forced ‘by the
Hitler regime to leave Germany. In his laboratory I learned an
incalculable amount about the art of laborator y research, both
from Bergmann himself and from the outstanding group of young
men that | he had gathered around him.

[ 1073 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

Shortly after Pearl Harbor, our laboratory began working for
the Office of Scientific Research and Development on problems
connected with chemical warfare, and these continued to occupy
our attention until V-J Day. The work was hard and unpleasant,
but I had the good fortune, not granted to most of my friends and
neighbors, of being allowed to remain with my family.

Following Bergmann’s death in 1944, 1 became an independent
investigator and since then have, together with a colleague,
assumed the direction of a gradually growing group engaged in
research dealing with the biochemistry of proteins and amino
acids. The period since the war has seen breathtaking advances
in biochemistry, and it has been thrilling to work during this time
and to contribute a mite here and a jot there. It has been thrilling,
yes, but also demanding. It has often been said that nature yields
new knowledge reluctantly, and this is true. Besides, the process
of acquiring this knowledge nowadays has become involved with
vast quantities of apparatus (which means large budgets and
much know-how); mountains of literature to keep track of (no
one, but no one, is truly well-read any more); numerous papers,
reviews, lectures, requests, reports, etc. to write (which, of course,
is why the literature is mountainous); and great numbers of people
to see (it is not usually realized that scientists are generally a
well-traveled lot). Although I occasionally feel that if someone
asks me another question which I can’t answer I shall take the
next conveyance to Samoa, I know that I wouldn’t really change
anything even if I could.

The difficulties of saying anything meaningful about a family
in a few lines are almost insuperable, but here goes. In 1936 I
married a wonderful girl whom I had known most of my life, and
today I am married to a wonderful woman I have known con-
siderably more of my life, We have three boys. One is a sopho-
more at Oberlin College; one is a senior at Millbrook School; and
the youngest is in seventh grade in the Junior High School in
Scarsdale. They are very different but fascinating people who
have given us fewer headaches and heartaches and more pride
and joy than we had any right to expect. During the last year
they have grown greatly in stature, both physical and mental.
Two of them are able to look down on us from a lofty six feet
plus, and to talk to us man-to-man. This is gratifying even

[ 1074 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

though it does make us feel—no, not old; definitely not—bur it
does take some getting-used-to.

Between job and family, true hobbies seem to have been
squeezed out, although pleasure and relaxation, of course, have
not. Tennis is still great fun, and I only wish there were more
time for books and music. This past summer the whole family
went to Europe. It was the first transoceanic journey for our
youngsters, and it is difficult to say who had the greater thrill,
we or they. They had the experience, but we watched them
have it.

Writing about beliefs is even harder than writing about
careers or families. Most who work in science believe, I think,
that we inhabit an orderly universe, of which, in time, given a
suitable intellectual climate, it should be possible to achieve a
fuller and more satisfying understanding. I would add that I
personally feel that such an increase in knowledge would be
a good thing. Granted, of course, that all knowledge is double-
edged, it still seems to me that along the path of understanding
lies man’s only hope of creating a social fabric worthy of his
potentialities and his aspirations. The antidote to the atom bomb
is not less knowledge of the atom, nor is it in bigger and better
bombs (after all, how dead can you get?); rather it seems to
me to reside in a better understanding of how it can come about
that nature’s most potentially rational animal can sometimes be-
have in such unbelievably irrational ways. Let us hope that by
the time our Fiftieth rolls around, the behavioral sciences will
be beginning to uncover answers to some of these questions.

I'VE spent most of my life since graduation as a working news-

Courier-Post newspapers, heading that organization for nine
years (with time out for army service). In 1949 I headed a
group which purchased the New Orleans Item, the largest eve-

In the Army, I entered as a buck private in 1943, went to O.CS.,
was discharged in 1946 as captain, after having served as Stars &

As a sort of hobby, I have written a number of short stories,
three books and a good many movies. My best known book is
“Francis,” the story of a talking mule, from which seven Holly-

just before Textron sold it. (I am reliably informed that the
appearance of my name on their research staff did not materially

I live in nearby Carlisle, but find that we usually head for New
England in vacation time. Such virtuous pursuits as rejuvenating
odd bits of lawn and converting cellar space into a game room
occupy a surprising amount of my free time; much of the rest
is consumed in plowing through piles of technical journals. The
fishing hereabouts is reported excellent, but [ve tried it with
only indifferent results. Golf and tennis have been neglected
in favor of playing badminton with the children. I enjoy bowl-
ing in the industrial league of the Carlisle area. Weekends we
often try climbing in the long, notched ridges of the mountains

Scouts.

MEMBER OF: American Association of School Administrators; National Edu-
cation Association, Phi Delta Kappa.

AS supervising principal of a public school, I lubricate, adjust,
repair, enlarge, rebuild, readjust and re-enlarge an educational
machine of about 150 uniquely individualistic parts. With it
our community of 6,000 people in an area of 4o square miles,
receives a 12 months a year, 12 hours a day program of educa-
tion, lakeside recreation, and guidance health and psychological
service for everyone, provided he is at least four years and eight
months old.

In human terms, I ease the worry, stiff-neck the lazy, stimulate
the tired, back-rub the devoted, replace the pregnant and search,
search, search for the dedicated recruit.

In money terms, I budget, collect, expand and account for a
little less than a million dollars a year.

In paper terms, too much goes across my desk and too much
rests there—sometimes for days.

Four wonderful stimulating kids, a beautiful, tireless wife
and a half-acre of garden are my loves.

In our last Class Report, I note that I said my largest irrita-
tion was reserved for those who fought to reserve for other and
often picayune expenditures, money which might better be spent
on education, This battle is still being lost, but, even so, my ire
rises even more easily now against a new and growing expres-
sion of selfishness. I refer to those who, under the protection of
free speech, maintain and enhance their income through the
cynical, sleasy, children-be-damned, virtue-be-violated, America-
be-defiled, writing and advertising practices of some business
firms, notably in the publishing, entertainment and luxury trades.

It’s funny; at age 47, I expected to be able to accept suc *h things
with greater equanimity!

TWO years ago when Tom, our oldest, set off for college, |
awoke with a start that the years had marched on. Now, a
twenty-fifth reunion is an even more pointed reminder — but I
do not yield to age. What have I done? Id like to know myself.

In the spring of 1933, looking forward to the close of four
pleasant, and I felt, effective years at Harvard, I determined to
end all dependence on Father and live on my own efforts hence-
forth. As all classmates can testify, the world of 1933 was not
waiting with open arms for the °33 graduates. There was no
spring influx of recruiters wooing flies with sweet honey. I

[ 1080 ]

took the one and only job I could latch on to—selling thread and
needles to dime and department stores for America’s number one
manufacturer of these necessities. For five years I pounded the
pavements by foot, travelled the by-roads by car, and wore out
the seats of my pants in the headquarters office—only to con-
clude that neither I nor they really knew very much about how
the job should be done. So, with much faith and little knowledge,
I moved into the promising field of market research. Looking
back, this appears to have been one of the better decisions of my
life. Nearly five years then passed so rapidly with Daniel Starch
& Staff that I can only vaguely remember the details — mostly
as the firm grew, I grew with it.

With some feeling of “knowing how,” I moved on to the
Campbell-Ewald Company (General Motors Advertising Agency)
as Market Analyst. These were the war years and Uncle Sam
couldn’t quite make up his mind what to do with me and my
family, Twice ordered to report and sent home at the last pos-
sible moment, I wound up holding down two jobs at once—my
regular one, part-time, and night shift in a war plant.

In 1945, I returned to Daniel Starch & Staff as a partner and
became president in 1955, It has been a rewarding career occupa-
tion and I anticipate no future moves. We work hard but the
rewards in personal satisfaction of accomplishment are great.

Victoria and I have been effective (four) but one-sided (all
boys) in our efforts to perpetuate society. We are thankful that
all four arrived safely and in the best of health—though there
have been moments when a deficiency in animal spirits would
have been appreciated. Our oldest, Tom, is now a sophomore in
Cambridge on the banks of the Charles but in the wrong institu-
tion—right, he says. I doubt that Richard, our second, by choice
or by accomplishment, will wear the Crimson. I have two more
chances in Bill and Kenny. So far, I’ve maintained a strict neu-
trality and made no attempt to guide the college selection process,
but ’'m not sure I can keep so pure a viewpoint indefinitely—
particularly as my opportunities dwindle without “purely
achieved” results.

Hobbies range far and wide. A stamp collector from early
boyhood, I’ve recently (with the help of more available funds)
renewed my interest here. Bridge I find stimulating, and with

[ ro8r ]

rp

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

my boys have literally built a house in the country upstate, which
we use aS a weekend retreat.

Politically, I have always been a low-pressure Republican and
find it easy to vote for what seems to be the better man regardless
of where on the ballot his name appears. In college my tutor
was far to the left of center. Later he became an inner circle mem-
ber of the brain trust. I found him to be an admirable tutor but
he generated in me (and some others I know) a feeling of extreme
wariness in assessing his ideas. He has long since fallen from
favor in our government and dropped out of sight in the national
scene. The experience has led me to conclude that some “com-
munists” in our colleges are not to be feared—in fact, they are
probably desirable. Danger lies only in one-sidedness—left, right
or center.

Victoria and I continue to be active in community activities.
I served a six-year term on the Board of Education, have just
completed a year as Master of a Masonic Lodge, have been at
various times a Boy Scout Commissioner, trustee and elder of
the Presbyterian Church, fund raiser on all sorts of drives, etc.
I continue to believe that you and I should participate more
in public affairs of all sorts. Each year government assumes a
greater and more urgent importance in guiding, if not controlling
our lives.

All told, the last twenty-five years have been highly rewarding
—a good opener for the second more interesting twenty-five
next to come.

HARVARD BROTHER: Peter Lewis Stone, 739.

occupation: Salesman, agricultural engineering firm.

AFTER leaving Cambridge in June of ’32, not with the blessing
of the Dean’s Office, I spent the following year in Belfast, Ire-
land, in the textile machinery foundry of James Mackie & Sons,
preparing for the jute business at home. This was a year I shall
never forget. There was plenty of work, but weekends gave me
a chance to hunt with the County Down Staghounds and to ar-
tend the Point-to-Point Races in various parts of Ireland.
Returning home in July of ’33, I went to work in the mills
of the Ludlow Manufacturing & Sales Company at Ludlow,
Massachusetts. Two years later I was in the main office in Boston.
About this time I got interested in a hobby which fortunately
my wife and I enjoy today more than ever, that of keeping and
raising game birds (pheasants, quail, wild ducks, wild geese).
Early in 1940 I felt that in the not too distant future a com-
mission in the Navy might be good property, so made necessary
applications. I don’t doubt that my three years in ROTC helped.
In August I was accepted as an ensign and promptly volunteered
for training duty which started in November, 1940, and lasted
until December 23, 1945. The first eighteen months were as
Ground School instructor in the Navy Air Corps at Pensacola
and Corpus Christi. From there I went to Sub Chaser School at
Miami and onto an SC. After nearly a year in New Guinea, it
was back to the States to prepare for a DE. I was on her nearly
two years, the last sixteen months as skipper, finally being shipped
home as lieutenant commander in time for Christmas in ’45.
After a good long terminal leave, I took up a new project,
dairy farming in Groton, Massachusetts. I can think of no better
way of living than on a farm, but the hours are long and the
work hard. Trying to buck the help situation and beat nature
(the droughts) make dairying a hazardous occupation. As a re-
sult, I gave up farming in the spring of ’56. Shortly after the
cows were sold I took a job selling portable irrigation equipment
for the Larchmont Engineering Company of Lexington, This
kept me in touch with the farming industry which I enjoved.
I am very fortunate in that my wife enjoys hunting as much

[ 1083 ]

as I do, so we spend our vacations deer hunting, usually in New
Brunswick. Having started raising a family quite late in our
careers, we are now more than glad, as two very small children
are sure going to help keep us young for a long time.

PVE moved around much since leaving Cambridge — New York,
Cincinnati, Minneapolis, the war years in both theatres, Philadel-
phia, Paducah, Kentucky then Phoenix, Arizona, London, Eng-
land, and now temporarily in greater Cincinnati, After a
ridiculous accident in our home in Phoenix, involving slipping
on a rug, which resulted in a not too trivial skull fracture, I spent
six months in a wheel chair. My very wonderful wife who is
an R.N, and is now teaching at Children’s Hospital in Cincinnati,
put up with me and got me back on my feet. Being unable to get
around adequately to see my clients even though my wife stepped
into the void and ran my business, I decided to sell the agency

and our home and we moved to London. After a very wonderful
year, we decided to return to the United States for reasons which
we suppose were important and we very reluctantly left our
beautiful flat in Chiswick and part of us, I’m afraid, in England.
Since returning here a few months ago, I’ve tried to get an “in-
side job” in the insurance industry, but age has been a hurdle so
far. Fortunately, my wife has been wonderful and we have kept
our heads up financially and she has kept a very stiff upper lip
and has done much to starch mine, and most fortunately we
have not had time to feel sorry for ourselves. We've had our
share of good and bad breaks and from now on we believe the
ball will bounce the right way.

IF Tyche has not been over-generous these latter years, Nemesis
has not been over-efficient. Things balance out. And the world
we live in, for the last twenty-five years, has not been a dull
one in which to watch and work.

Putting the reflections down on paper is no easier for me than
for the rest of the Class whom it has been my duty to pursue
in this biographical matter. I know “that all the words of wise
men who are skilled in using them are not much to defy what
comes when memory meets the unfulfilled.” And we all know
that the finitude of life requires that it be unfulfilled, if one is
not to become a vegetable.

We got off to a good start in 1933 with the economic depres-
sion, and I was fortunate at that time to be already working for
the Boston Globe. There was later a great surge of unionization,
and via a union of newspapermen, I got mixed up in that. When
I had quite enough of that, World War II was available and I
asked myself into uniform. The Army survived me and f sur-
vived it. Then there was the job of comforting the consciences
of colleagues who were developing inferiority complexes over
their lack of military service and their memories of getting their
meat on the black market in Boston. This was very easy to do
since I could recall my wife doing without meat so that my
children could have enough, while I was eating boned steaks be-
times in Greenland, and censoring the mail of men who were
complaining to their mothers about wanting some “real hawg
meat.”

Postwar, there was more newspaper work, some interesting
side work in the field of mental health in Massachusetts, then
Europe with the family for four months, six months of volunteer

[ 1086 }

work for United Community Services, and finally my entry to
the periphery of the oil industry.

Things look rather good. Our Class has endured all this war
and depression and disruption, and bids fair to survive together-
ness, government by smile, and the ever-open mouth as a way
of life. :

Occupationally, I am happy as I suppose are most, represent-
ing business men in a manner which so far has permitted an-
ticipation of their ultimate valid industrial and political interests
while they are naturally more occupied with the here and now
of the balance sheet. Lately, my business constituency has
been kind enough to give me the designation general counsel,
a fairly high-sounding title to go with a degree of Washington
legislative work and a median sort of salary. The petroleum in-
dustry is a lulu from the standpoint of “something new every
day” somewhere in the world. And its Oil Information Com-
mittee has been kind enough to give me a couple of awards for
trying to help out the industry’s public relations effort.

The big family effort reaches a plateau in June when the
younger of my two daughters, Marcia, will have completed her
preparation for college. Gail, Radcliffe ’59, is currently on leave
of absence and is for the time a working girl while she decides
whether to return to college next year. It’s a small world: she
is sharing an apartment with the working-girl-student daughter
of an ex-Harvard dean who had charge of a couple of scholar-
ships I needed, and got, in college.

Annette, a person of very wide interests, will negotiate the
shift from the suburban mother role with ease.

There is gratitude. Gratitude for having a family, for wanting
to be healthy, for professional activity, for European journeys,
for golf, for the experiencing of nature. And gratitude to all who
have tried to educate me, including the family and my class-
mates. My great wish: another twenty years or so, in reason-
able health, to meet with people in a free world, to work well,
and to see how things come out.

Ancillary wishes: to go again to Europe, to visit Poggibonsi,
and toward Fiesole to walk:

. .. the road that winds, from city of bright joy
And flowers of a universal age that will

Not die, past Casa Triste there, where Ovra cut

And clubbed, beyond old walls and up the ancient path
Whose surface of macadam seems transparent through -
To cobbles round and smooth from matched caress and beat
Of legions of Etruscan feet and Roman too,

So long before our little time of clocks and clerks.

One last word: I think we have all been very lucky that there
is an American institution known as Harvard. That goes for
1933, the postwar years, the present, and the foreseeable future.
It has been more than worth while to have worked for the
University as an alumnus.

FROM the lack of a list of memberships and officerships in or-

my life has been an unimpressive one. However, I’ve enjoyed it
so far; but there is nothing to show for it. We take three vaca-
tions a year when the spirit moves us. Short trips, generally to
San Francisco, are about all time will allow. What the Roosevelt
years and the Truman “war” did to my economy and peace of
mind, if described here, would add too somber a note to your

I HAVE put off writing this for weeks now, finding all manner
of excuse. I suppose it’s difficult to face, at typewriter's-length,
the fact that twenty-five years have gone by, that one’s life has
passed the point of no return with such terrifying speed, and with

[ 1091 ]

not very many people saw it—as popular motion pictures go.
But, at the Cannes Film Festival, it won the Prix Chevalier de Ia
Barre, defeating excellent entries from France, Japan and other
countries. This prize is given to “this year’s film which best helps
freedom of expression and tolerance.” And man, I heard at Har-
vard, does not live by bread alone. . . .

On which earth-shattering line it might be well to conclude. I
haven’t the answers to the questions of twenty-five years ago.
Perhaps the only one I think I’ve learned was stated in a letter
from Professor Powell, of the Law School, to Justice Cardozo:
“We must spread the gospel that there is no gospel that will save
us from the pain of choosing at every step... .”

AFTER struggling for two years to meet the term payments
at Harvard I finally gave up—a victim of the depression. My
father’s business was in the doldrums of the business recession,
his real estate holdings were deflated, and he was in no position
to give me any financial assistance. In fact, I had to go to work
and bring some money into the house to help support the rest
of the family—seven of us.

I had a varied assortment of jobs and experiences for about
five years ranging from selling magazine subscriptions in Maine
and New Hampshire to working in a junk shop sorting metals.

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

No job was too hard or too dirty as long as it was honest and
brought a good return.

Eventually, I settled down to the drug business and decided
to make a career of it. It seemed the steadiest and the most
dignified available to me at that time. I started at the bottom of
the ladder working as a combination soda clerk and porter in a
drug store in Roxbury at eight dollars per week. I supplemented
my work with courses in pharmacy at the New England Col-
lege of Pharmacy. With the excellent background I had from
my two years of a liberal arts education, it took me little time
to master the arts of pharmacy. I spent exactly one month of
concentrated study; took the State Board examination and passed
It.

I worked for four years as a registered pharmacist and clerk
at a pretty fair salary as salaries went in those depression years.
However, it was soon apparent to me that if I wanted to get
anywhere in the drug business, I would have to launch a busi-
ness of my own. Moreover, my financial resources were small.
Nevertheless, with a little financial help from family and friends,
I opened a drug store in Brookline in 1940. I had a very difficult
struggle the first two years because of insufficient capital but I
persevered and finally saw the business growing and expanding
progressively.

As for my family—I married in 1936 and have been blessed
with two children both going to college now. My daughter ts
a junior at Simmons. My son is a freshman at Massachusetts
College of Pharmacy and has been working at my store the
last four years. Someday in the near future 7 hope to sce him
join me in the business.

My recreational activities have been confined to continuing
my game of tennis in season and following the fortunes of the
Red Sox—waiting till next year.

A GREAT deal has happened to the world in the twenty-five

years since we graduated. A great deal has happened to me, too.

And yet I feel less changed, after twenty-five years, than I

would have supposed possible in 1933. I have changed, of course.

My hair is thin, my waist is thick, My beard, when J let it grow,
is rather white. I am more set in my ways, more irritable and
much more skeptical about the benefits of “progress” and modern-
ity. But I am still actively interested in the principal physical
and mental pursuits which were my favorites in undergraduate
days. My main intellectual interests are those which could be
foreseen in 1933: mathematics as a professional specialty and,

[ 1096 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

for the whole man, literature, history and philosophy. My pre-
dilection for the mountains as a place of spiritual and physical
recreation has continued unabated. Some weeks of every year
are spent in high country, camping, roaming by Jakes and streams,
and clambering over rocky and snowy ridges and peaks.

For twenty-five years now I have been living the life of a
scholar and teacher; first as a graduate student and later as a
faculty member at the California Institute of Technology, then
a year doing postdoctoral research at Princeton, and since 1938
at the University of California in Los Angeles. A mighty fine
life I have found it to be, I discovered from tutoring jobs at
Harvard that I took pleasure in teaching. I enjoy the process
of learning, organizing and clarifying what I have learned, and
the exposition of it for other students, It has been exciting and
satisfying to watch my students growing in appreciation and
mastery of mathematics. |

At times I have felt some frustration for lack of adequate op-
portunity for original research. Teaching, and assorted chores
and administrative tasks, eat up most of a professor’s time unless
he carefully and doggedly nurses along his determination to
stay alive as a creative scholar. In this determination I have
been aided twice since the war by sabbatical leaves which en-
abled me to gain a certain peace of mind by an infusion of scholar-
ship while the teacher in me lay fallow. The first of these years
was spent in Cambridge, England—a place whose mood and
physical charm I had come to love during a few visits there in
wartime. (I worked for a year in England as a consultant on
bombing accuracy, with the Eighth Air Force. This work was
then known as “operational research,” or “operations analysis.”
The fashion for such “braintrusting” has spread widely in recent
years.) My second sabbatical year was spent partly in Switzer-
land, at Geneva, and partly in Germany, where I held a F ulbright
Research Fellowship at the Johannes Gutenburg University at
Mainz.

The book which is the final fruit of this second sabbatical year
is soon to be published, It is my third book, and is for graduate
students and research mathematicians, My first book ts a success-
ful calculus text; it has been a standard text for Harvard fresh-
men for a number of years. My second book, a thick tome on

[ 1097 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

calculus for upperclassmen, has also had considerable success

and has been used at Harvard.

A family imposes cares on a man and cuts a large hole out of

the time which he might have for thinking and writing. But for
most men I suppose, and certainly for me, the joys of the family
group and the contributions of individual family members to
the experience of each day, form the web of normality which
makes life stable and whole. The children take us through all
their joys and disappointments, and make us realize the wisdom
of some of the things our parents told us when we thought we
knew better. With one son a sophomore at Harvard, one a
senior in high school and a small daughter with a bevy of third-
graders and Brownies for playmates who are always under foot,
I have experienced quite a range of the “phases” through which
sometimes distraught parents hope their children will soon pass.
I am sure there are surprises yet in store for me. But it is all
life and I envy not, nay, I pity, the bachelor scholar who has
had less disturbance of his weighty thoughts but missed the fun
and vitality of family life.

I met my wife-to-be on a mountain excursion and almost
instantly we began to sense the kinship of our spirits. The mystic
wonder of mountains, their lure and their capacity to enchant
us and give us balm, have remained dominant in our lives. We
have just returned, this past summer, from a season in the Alps.
There can never be another summer quite like it for us, because
time will spread us apart and age will inevitably intervene to deter
me from a repetition of our strenuous mountaineering. The boys
and I climbed a dozen or so of the highest mountains in Switzer-
land (including traverse of Monte Rosa and the Lyskamm); my
wife climbed a lesser number of peaks. All of us, except the
small daughter, ascended the Matterhorn. Next summer we'll
settle for something nearer home in the California Sierras; but
mountains we must surely have.

I’ve never been able to define my religious and moral convic-
tions with any precision. I grew up in a Protestant home and
in an atmosphere on the whole rather puritanical, though my
father was philosophically inclined, and a freethinker. I take
after my father in these latter respects and like him I tend by
nature to be optimistic. As a rough generalization I consider it

[ 1098 |

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

an ideal to be moderate in all things and to preserve a certain
detachment and balance in thoughts and opinions. But there
is also a place in life for intensity, for ecstasy and carefree abandon
and for total devotion to a cause. I guess it requires more space
and time than I'll ever have to define and clarify the proper
scope of these and other traits for the good life.

I view with increasing concern the growth of population and
the urbanization of the land. My native optimism is strained
when I see broad sunny valleys of orange groves giving way to
smog-palled areas of tract houses. I also have a difficult time
with optimism in the face of the political problems of the day.
However, I don’t anticipate an immediate end of the world
through fission or radio activity and I’m not disposed to get an
ulcer from worrying about the future.

SINCE graduation my business life has been devoted to the
Boston Globe where I have worked continuously with the ex-
ception of three years in the Navy. I find the privilege of helping
to put out a good newspaper one of endless fascination. In an
age when the truth is too often cut in half or twisted for propa-
ganda purposes, the constant search for the full news and the
publication of that news fairly and objectively is a most reward-
ing experience.

A newspaper is an engrossing vocation and outside of family
interests I have developed no true hobbies. Casual golf and
gardening afford some recreation and I have served on the
usual community and school committees, In recent years a small
place in Francestown, New Hampshire, has provided a great
deal of pleasure during the summers and on occasional winter
weekends.

Needless to say, my wife and I have greatly enjoyed the rear-
ing of four sons. Now the sure sign of middle age has set in and
I find myself allowed to do less and less to amuse myself, and

HOW swiftly pass the years! Oh, those happy days of varsity
baseball, with Barry Wood at short, Eddie Mays at second and the
brilliant Charlie Devens pitching, plus all the other fine friends and
sportsmen on the team, coached by the wily Fred Mitchell. Then
oh, those worrisome hours of final examinations, with the blessed
relief of an A.B. degree won the hard way. It seems not too long
ago, at that, that my first year out of college was spent in New
York City, working at the enthralling business of marine insurance
underwriting at the Marine Office of America, sharing a large
Greenwich Village apartment with classmates Warwick Car-
penter, John Beach and Howard Stone. After a year in New York,
on to San Francisco, with a wedding in Santa Barbara, and later
three “blessed events,” one in San Francisco, one in Stockton,
California, and the last in Pasadena.

My attractive, intelligent, understanding, patient and courageous
wife, Dorothy, and I have lived in San Marino (suburb of Los
Angeles and next-door-neighbor to Pasadena) for the past fifteen
years, enjoying to the full our mutual hobby, golf. Iam a middle-
of-the-road (if not the middle of the fairway) “8” handicapper.
My wife is the talented one with the “sticks,” having been runner-
up twice in our club championship, also runner-up in the Mon-
tana Women’s State Championship, a member of the ‘“Hole-in-
One” Club, an eighties and occasional seventies player. We hope
that our youngest, “Tony,” will join in the fun.

It takes many things to make up a lifetime, I suppose. The loss
of our fourteen-year-old son, Hamilton III, in a hunting accident
in 1953 indeed tried our souls. A few short months before, my
father, the first Hamilton of the family, passed away here in our
home after a brief illness of a week. (He, too, was a graduate of
Harvard, both of the College and of the Law School.)

Without any touch of the “Pollyanna,” T assure you, I can and
must say that life has been good in other ways: in my choice of
wife, in the gift of my children, and the added blessing of three
granddaughters, the progeny of my daughter, Diane. Business,

too, has smiled upon me, particularly with my association in 1953
with Chubb & Son of New York, a magnificent firm with an in-
ternational reputation for high character and integrity, not to
mention skill in insurance underwriting. (I also must record that
the gentleman who gave me my first business opportunity back in
1933 was Mr. Owen Cates Torrey, assistant manager of the Ma-
rine Office of America at that time, and father of our classmate
Tom Torrey.)

An infection of the spine has plagued me for the past year, help-
ing me to view two fine Pasadena hospitals from the wrong side,
however, the infection has subsided, leaving me in fair enough
shape, but blocking almost any chance for attendance at Cam-

bridge in June. In spite of all. . “Here’s to Johnny Harvard.”

SEVENTEEN domiciles in eight different locations since grad-
uation may not be a point for emphasis unless one is a career
foreign service officer, but such movement has filled the years
with many interesting times. The better portion of these valuable
experiences is attributable to my foresight as a freshman in sign-
ing up for Naval Science, as events have led to spending nearly
half my working life in the Navy (U.S.N.R.). I might still be
there but for the fact that a decision was made that I could not
progress beyond commander due to a physical flaw. So I was
separated from the service in 1957 upon completion of the Inter-
national Naval Review at Hampton Roads—the discharge being
especially memorable as signed by our distinguished classmate,
Albie Pratt, Acting Secretary of the Navy—and moved to Wash-
ington into a “permanent” home at last.

An equally great credit for those interesting years goes to
my wife, who not only has created unusual events herself, but
has entered into all changes of scene with enthusiasm and zest.
As soon as we were married she decided upon a fashion career
and in very short order became one of the country’s top fashion
editors, an effort which has not been continued in recent times
due to Navy life.

I started out thinking that my work would be spent with
the shipping business, for the years before the war were asso-
ciated in the Latin American trade at the Grace Line in New
York. However, the long war period at sea affected many a
man’s direction, and I took off enthusiastically in 1946 with TACA
Airways which was intended to rival Pan American in Central
and South America. As the traffic did not match the enthusiasm,
another shift had to be made, and after many months of job-
hunting, I joined Bob Ayer, ’32, in the fire-fighting equipment
business with Randolph Laboratories. Two years and some
months later, our part of the operation was changed.

The postwar period in New York City began to pall, with
little outlook for any of life’s real satisfactions, so I found a

[ 1104 ]

$$]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

reason to move to San Francisco in 1950, which took the form

of a plastic paint venture. It was at this point that my wife gave

up her fashion editing career and then, a few months later,

we were moving from San Francisco to New Orleans on Nav y

orders. After one Mardi Gras season and two of the hottest

summers, it was to London for the Coronation of 1953 and two
of the coldest summers, as well as the beginning of a long asso-
ciation with the finest combination of naval officer, diplomat
and statesman, Admiral Jerauld Wright. I had the good fortune
of serving with him for over four years in several Capacities,
the last two and a half at Atlantic Fleet and NATO Headquarters
at Norfolk, Virginia. Since leaving the Navy and NATO, I
have been associated with the excellent International Trade Fair
program in which the United States has been participating re-
cently by entering exhibits in strategic locations abroad, the
more peaceful and, we hope, effective method of combating
Communism.

Besides travel and work, new interests seem to develop from
time to time. Whereas in New York bachelor days I would
take great joy in visiting Minsky’s, I now prefer to spend my
pilfered time in an art gallery, as I became an occasional week-
end painter upon arrival in San Francisco. I am expecting that
this avocation will become more and more satisfying. Sailing
and skiing, both of which I engaged in ardently between 1946
and 1950 (a thirty-five-foot sloop owned me) probably will
not figure too frequently in the future. The extra-curricular
activity which for us continues to be favorite and feasible ts
bridge; we shall never have enough practice!

For the future I foresee a continued attachment to forcign
and government affairs, provided a good Republican does not
become an obstacle. Of course, should my wife decide to return
to fashion work, I could then look forward to retiring In com-
fort and following her around with my brush and canvas. Ie
would be pleasant to spend six months of every year in Paris.

JOINED the Insurance Company of North America after
graduation and, except for four years during the War, I have
been with this company ever since. Obviously it has been a
mutually satisfactory set-up, and if Uncle Sam would call off
the tax dogs, I might even feel 1 was being paid enough!

As to the war years, I was called to Washington in December,
1941, to help set up war risk insurance functions for the War
Shipping Administration and wound up spending two and a
half years buying large commercial vessels from private owners
as director of Large Vessel Procurement. Joined the Coast Guard
in 1945, but remained a land-locked sailor, serving in the Com-
mandant’s office until discharged as a lieutenant commander.

There has been a modest amount of traveling, mainly within
this country and Canada, the West Indies and Europe, on business.
Most of this has been alone, to the disgust of my wife and older
children. After the War we were lucky enough to find a large

five years later an unexpected “Blessing from Heaven” turned
out to be twin girls! In age the children stretch from twenty to
six, the oldest being i in college, and the youngest in first grade,

Our social activities are pretty much limited to the weekends,
as it is with most commuters. Politically, we should be classed
as “Taft” Republicans. Religiously, we have been considerably
more active during the last ten years, and it has done not a
bit of harm!

FROM the Medieval Academy of America to the Society of Print-
ers — such has been the course of my life during the past quarter
century. The elapsed years have been jammed with activities,
mostly avocational, but all of which add up to “the good life in
America,” at least as I understand it.

Back in 1933, book learning came so easily to me that I tarried

[ 1107 |

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

comfortably within the labyrinthine stacks of Widener. Through
inevitable interaction there came a Doctorate in Romance Philol-
ogy, an appointment to the faculty of the Fordham University
Graduate School, and a wife whose staunch confidence in me has
been as enduring as it has been flattering.

Four happy years of teaching and research in medieval Jan-
guages and literature slipped by in an atmosphere of rare peace
and contentment. But while I had been lecturing on the power
politics theories of Machiavelli, others had been doing. By night-
fall of December 7, 1941, I was off to the Field Artillery.

The War Department, however, had other plans for me, The
General Staff required a simple but effective technique for com-
munication between the American soldier and the peoples with
whom he might eventually be engaged in a global war. The im-
mediate result for me was command of a unit so polyglot that
anyone who spoke with an American accent within our sacred
preserves was suspect of being an enemy agent. Russian generals,
Chinese and Filipino waiters, Suaheli mission boys, German and
Italian prisoners, Nisei, North Africans, Levantines — they all gib-
bered and jabbered in relays while I tried to transcribe into Ameri-
can orthography sounds which would still remain intelligible
when mouthed by Texans, Brooklynites and Cantabrigians from
Kansas. I was convinced that the forces of diversification are So
much more personal and omnipresent than those of unification that
a universal tongue is completely impractical.

Two memorably brilliant spots mark those months of impa-
tience and frustration. The first was the companionship and Olym-
pian wisdom of Leonard Bacon, Pulitzer Prize Poet, requiescat in
pace. The other was the birth of my daughter Sandra, on the very
day I left on a new assignment in Military Intelligence.

Constant complaints about the inefficiency of the newly-organ-
ized Office of Strategic Services got me my just deserts. I was trans-
ferred into the O.S.S. with the mission of satisfying my own com-
plaints in North Africa, Italy and the Balkans. The invasion of
Southern France saw me back in the army, all the way to Berlin.
An interesting experience was service with Cabot Lodge and Aly
Khan as liaison officers to French colonial troops in the field.

After the war, it was back to Harvard until I was impressed with
the compelling force of environment on development of the indi-

[ 1108 ]

vidual. For the previous five long years mine had been too ditfcr-
ent to permit a comfortable return to the snows of yestery car.
Besides which, teaching had become a luxury I could no longer
afford.

The printing and publishing industry attracted me as an indus-
try closely allied to my former profession. Schools and colleges
are among our best customers; we produce several learned publica-
tions. I must admit that what little reverence I ever had for the
authority of the printed word has been considerably diminished.
On the other hand, I enjoy the opportunity and the leisure to read
the classics about which I used to lecture so learnedly.

To sum it all up, I continue to have the utmost faith in this, my
native land. In domestic politics I prefer Democratic principles
administered by Republican office holders, which is my definition
of modern Republicanism. In international politics, I would like
to see a reaffirmation of a classic doctrine with appropriate modh-
fications: civis americanus sum, noli me tangere. Having experi-
enced life in countries where the color of my shirt was dictated,
my devotion to this land in which I need wear no shirt at all is
quite determined. A policy of peace through deterral might well
impress potential aggressors if they were to be convinced that

Americans wouldn’t like such aggression.

I wouldn't.

THE first year out of college gave me my “rounded” education:
in a department store for two months, as a beachcomber for
another month, professional investigator for two months and
ditch digger for one month, Jobs were scarce and I had acquired
the eating habit. The frosting was taken off my cake and I
learned to eat crow. My experiences stood me in good stead
through the years, for I learned about people, the finest story
ever written.

In May, 1934, 1 was employed as a real estate managing agent
by the Home Title Insurance Company, later the Home Title
Guaranty Company. In stages I learned a great deal about real
estate in all its facets, managing, mortgaging and appraising. I
did take courses in appraisal theory to qualify myself better in
the field. August, 1940, found me seeking greener fields at The
Dime Savings Bank of Brooklyn. I was hired as an appraiser.
Our portfolio is made up of dwellings, income properties and
some specialties. I grew with the institution from 214 million
dollars in assets and ten thousand in mortgages to today’s imminent
one billion dollars in assets and seventy-five thousand in mort-
gages, In May, 1951, I was promoted to chief appraiser; in 1954,
to assistant secretary and in 1956 to assistant vice-president.

In February, 1942, 1 was drafted into the Army as a private
and rose through the ranks to major, Military Intelligence, in
1944. Mine was a “cook’s tour” around the world and three
theaters of combat. The Good Lord was kind to me and I got
through it all without a scratch. I received the American Legion

My wife is a registered nurse now spending her time keeping
our two sons “in line” and attempting to keep me miles from

Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. My younger son, Bruce, will soon go

My hobbies center about photography and ships. Usually I
spend my vacations aboard cruise ships plying between here
(New York) and South America. If I had the opportunity “to
go back” twenty-five years I would want to meet more people,
complain less, laugh more, and take in much more of Harvard
than I did. I’m so grateful to our college for having given me
some of the tools with which to learn how to think,

I shall always be interested in psychology and literature; I
hope soon to finish a doctoral dissertation, a psycho-analytic
study of a Restoration dramatist. Another interest which keeps
us in New York is going to the theatre without regard to what
might be the ten best plays of the season. Our Morningside
Heights apartment is separated from the theatre district chiefly
by the length of Central Park and an inseparable part of the
pleasure of going to the theatre is the drive through the park.

We like the sun and the sea; from May into October we week-
end at our small waterfront cottage on a remote and beautiful
harbor on Eastern Long Island, 125 miles from our front door
intown, There the sounds we hear are natural ones; the almost
incessant winds, the gulls, and from across the narrow strip of
dunes and moorland which forms the peninsula, the ocean surf.
Our planting is limited to things which are indigenous to the
soft marine climate and which can survive the hurricanes and
other winds: beach plum, hayberry, blueberry, cactus, coreopsis,
day lilies, dusty miller, honeysuckle, Japanese black pine, and
most rewarding of all, the hardier climbing roses. If we are to
have a vegetable garden another year it will have to be sunken
so that the roots can reach the water table between weekend
waterings, and sturdily fenced to keep out the deer which wander
over from Hitler Hills Park.

tiful dry cleaning plants in the country.

IN September, 1934, I went to work for H. E. Harris & Company
of Boston. A hobby became a profession with all its ramifications
of foreign currencies, history, geography, counterfeits, buying,
selling, etc. Fascinating business and a hobby more widely in-
dulged in by mature adults than generally suspected.

In 1945 a job with Rose-Derry Company in Newton beckoned.
Watching the figures on the annual crop of babies became an
important duty. Why? We make the finest nationally adver-
tised crib mattresses and allied items. My work straddles the
problems of selling and manufacturing.

The more strenuous activities of tennis and home-remodelling
have given way of late to a mild mania for Fli-Fi, even to the
point of accepting a challenge to put together a kit. Does it

work? But of course! The decibels now have free play
in a specially constructed room.

Mare is now at Brown. Our record collections were one
source of common interest although his preferences are consid-
erably different from mine. Roger has now become interested
in jazz, thereby rounding out our musical interests. He is a
senior at Newton High. Here we go again through the college
application business—and the agonizing wait in the spring.

Between family interests, Hi-Fi and house chores, each year
seems to go by just a mite faster.

HAVING developed an interest in mental illness through con-
centrating in psychology at Harvard, I decided in June, 1933,
that I would go to medical school, Then followed two years of
working for the Emergency Relief Administration and _pre-
medical work. My four years at the Harvard Medical School
were not only reasonably well spent, but reasonably well bought,
inasmuch as I found I could make as much money while going
to medical school as I had in the cruel world outside.

After residency training in psychiatry, the war afforded me

[1114]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

an opportunity to see something of the world, and four years
vacation I would not otherwise have had. As a flight surgeon in
Naval Aviation, I may have even learned something about the
problems of aviation in relation to psychiatry. I did learn that
it was about time to settle down, and when I met Lucy, I was
convinced, so we were launched on the sea of Matrimony. Al-
though the sea has not always been calm, there have been no
major storms, and I believe our seamanship has improved with
the years. David (aged eight) and Leslie (female, aged six) are
alternately giving us fits and great satisfaction, We think they
have great potentialities, even though they will not be eligible
for the Reunion. I would not have missed this voyage for the
world.

Since the war, I have been on the staff of the Lahey Clinic
in psychiatry and neurology, and engaged in what might be
called the general practice of psychiatry. I have no couch, and
if I did I would use it myself. I have become more and more con-
vinced that the progress which is being made and will be made in
psychiatry will be along physiological lines. This may seem
strange to some, as the public has been presented a picture of psy-
chiatry and psychoanalysts as the panacea and Freud as God. But
the results of psychoanalysis have fallen far short of the propa-
ganda, and the ridicule of the analyst’s couch has been partly
deserved. Progress is being made, however, and physiological
basis for some mental disorders will be discovered i in our lifetime,
provided we live long enough.

In the hours of leisure, we enjoy as much tennis and sailing
as possible, and try not to be inundated by the wave of conformity
in suburbia. Religiously, I found the Unitarian Church had em-
bodied my beliefs long before I was born. Politically, I am anti-
McCarthy, pro-Eisenhower, and belong to the strongest political

party which always controls the national elections—the Inde-
pendent Party.

That is where I stand at this point. In June, we look forward
to seeing old friends and many new ones at the Reunion.

earlier. Apart from that I have no regrets except perhaps the lack
of roots in a community here at home. This is a disadvantage of
living and working overseas, but I believe that liking the work
and believing in it are overriding considerations.

UPON graduation I encountered the general disdain of the
depression-plagued world toward one who was merely well-
rounded, and fled to the sanctuary of the Law School, Emerged
reasonably well-pointed, practised Jaw in the environs of Boston
for a while, and then was drawn to Washington in the turbulent
days of the New Deal. The war years, divided between the In-
fantry and C.LD., Europe and the Pacific, provided consider-
able time for reflection, out of which grew the convictions that
individual freedom of action was the most precious of the free-
doms, and that roots were important. —

Returned to the Department of Justice, enjoying once again
associations with its able and dedicated lawyers, but resolved
to leave the Government as soon as feasible. Thereupon entered

[ 1120 |

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

private practice in Washington, and, soon thereafter, got married.
Since wife Edythe is also a lawyer, practice under these circum-
stances has proved most felicitous, and while the advent of
daughter Jacqueline has relegated jurisprudence to the back-
ground, Edythe insists that her defection is only temporary.
Have also entered the world of commerce by becoming vice-
president and counsel of a company engaged mainly in Export
of rail and railroad equipment.

Principal present preoccupation arises out of our acquisition,
some years ago, of several thousand acres of unspoiled woodland,
lying along the Potomac in nearby Maryland. Two years ago
was made aware of the deplorable inadequacy of basic research
in this country, and the wasteful duplication and lack of co-
ordination in the modicum which existed. Conceived the idea of
a national center for basic scientific research, set upon a campus
where outstanding scientists would live in a community planned
to accommodate their every need—professional, cultural and
recreational. In this climate of advanced inquiry, industries, in-
dividually or cooperatively, would establish laboratories for the
pursuit of knowledge in specific fields. Here there would be
created a central scientific intelligence to keep under constant
scrutiny scientific endeavor everywhere and to collate and make
known to these scientists all relevant data. To this basic research
center both industry and government could turn for the solution
of problems upon the frontiers of knowledge.

The recent spectacular achievements of the Russians, and their
disturbing implications, have served to rally leaders of industry
and science to the idea. I am convinced that its speedy implemen-
tation is essential to the very survival of our way of life.

THE easy way to write a report for the Twenty-fifth is to quote
from the Fifteenth Report and go on from there, so I shall.

“After several accounting jobs mostly around Boston, but with
one in Springfield, Vermont, where I learned to ski, the Army
decided they could use me. After Finance School, I went to
England and spent my free time for several months before D-Day
seeing the central part of the country by bicycle. On the con-
tinent I was with the Eighth Corps, so was in the right place at
the right time to collect five campaign stars which helped toward
eventual discharge as a staff sergeant.”

That accounts for the first half of the twenty-five-year period,
so now for the next.

On my return to civilian life, I was married to Frances Keyes.
In the past twelve years we have lived in four places, and are now
moving to the above address. The first moves were due to an
expanding family, but this one is planned so we can live on a quiet
side street within sight of Longfellow Park and the Cambridge
Skating Club. By this time we know the real estate and moving
company people by their first names. Like many in Cambridge,
we choose to live here as commuting is not in my line ... route
128 to Annisquam in the summer convinces me of that.

I have recently become budget officer at Boston University
after seven years as assistant comptroller and nearly four years as
comptroller. With the great demand for admission to college, the
business end of the administration of a university is increasingly
busy and interesting.

My family and social life might sound dull on paper, but I would
not change it. Skating, bowling and trips to museums with the
boys take up a little of my spare time in the winter. In the sum-
mer, Frances is teaching them to swim and to sail a Turnabout at
Annisquam. Between school activities at Buckingham and Browne
& Nichols and other neighborhood projects, she is more active
than I, although I have tried to do my share in the usual fund-
raising drives in the community.

A DISAPPOINTED Republican for twenty-five years, I have
lost hope for less government regulation and less government in
business. Despite this political disappointment, I have enjoyed
a very happy life, first as a bachelor living “in town,” then as
a married commuter. With the exception of four years of active
duty in the Navy, there has been little to punctuate my happy
routine. An occasional vacation in Europe or South America is

sometimes substituted for the yearly spring vacation trip to Florida
or Arizona.

IT seemed a lot easier under the economic conditions prevailing
in June of 1933 to stroll across the Harvard Yard to Gannett
House and to enroll in the Law School than to try to hunt a job
— the Law School did not have to weed out as many applicants
in those days. So the proximity of Langdell Hall and the continu-
ing static business activity started me on a legal career.

Many of the graduates in 1936 were either migrating to Wash-
ington for government service or to the big law offices in the
larger cities. I left Cambridge for New York City, where I spent
a number of years doing yeoman service and receiving legal train-
ing at the Cravath law firm. In due course, feeling that I was then

a qualified lawyer, I joined the legal staff of the Trustees of As-
sociated Gas and Electric Corporation, a part of the organization
that was then engaged in reorganizing the Hopson public utility
holding company system. The reorganization staff was a sclf-
liquidating organization, but before we all became liquidated I
found myself at Bethlehem. On counting the years, I note that |
have been working for Bethlehem Steel Company over fifteen
years, performing services which, I think, have a legal flavor.

My sons have now reached college age. Bing is a junior at
Washington and Lee University; Peter is a freshman at Harvard.
Bing thinks he may be a geologist; Peter is undecided, with a
slight leaning to the legal field.

Several years ago, having read about Mr. Blandings and his
“Dream House” I decided to build a home, hoping to avoid his
mistakes. I managed to make most of his errors plus a number he
never dreamed about. But we are now living in the new home
and hope eventually to have all mistakes rectified.

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

THE events influencing the course of my life since 1933 have
been — completion of law school, starting to practise in Detroit,
working for the F.B.L, returning to law practice in Detroit, and
getting married. These are all universal type events which are
happening all the time to all sorts of people including Harvard
College alumni. Perhaps the most unusual thing about this com-
mon-place chain of events was getting married at the end of the
chain rather then earlier. As can be seen by the above statistics
this happened in 1954.

Like Mayor Curley, I suppose I’d do it all over again, but there
are a few things I'd like to do a little differently. One would be to
get married earlier. When I think of all the time I wasted sailing
or strutting about some amateur stage, or singing or reading, or
just chasing a tennis ball, I am appalled. There is so much to learn
and so much to do and there is so little time — I am looking for-
ward to reading or hearing personal accounts on how to be a
successful husband and father i in the hope of easing the burden of
my lack of experience.

This is not to sound a note of regret. When Jacquie, her three
children, and I were married I was, to borrow an historical phrase
from Frisky, in medias res. I’ve loved almost every minute of it
from that moment on. |

Married couples are always being asked in television and radio
interviews how they met. Usually some person or occasion 1s said

to bear the awesome responsibility. In our case, I bow in respect-
ful thanks to dear old Yale! It seems that in the college at New
Haven there are people who like to drink beer and sing. Now I
don’t like to drink beer, but I like to sing. In the days when I was
wasting my time singing I fell in with a group of former Spizz-
winks, Whiffenpoufs or what have you valiantly carrying on their
New Haven traditions. They also had a name — the Grunyons.
I became a member. Jacqueline came to hear the Grunyons sing
— the story writes itself from there. Dear old Yale — for me she
can never again be quite so great an example of the anti-climax.

My present recollection is that at first I didn’t like the practice
of law too well. The jump from the theories of law school to the
realities of practice left some adjustments to make. Now it seems
a continuously challenging and exciting occupation. If that seems
a glamorous statement to make about something sounding as stiff

[ 1126 |

and stuffy as “corporation law,” please reflect on this. Remember,
the corporation is a fiction and fictions exist only in men's minds,
philosophical minds, legal minds — a limitless variety of minds.
Recall the quote from Dickens to the effect that the law is an ass.
It sometimes is. Challenge and excitement are words of undcr-
statement.

My stepchildren are three in number and infinite in their curi-
osities and approaches to living. They have put me in my place
and made me rejoin my own generation. Anticipation of our
Twenty-fifth becomes keen when I realize that it will include my
wife and children.

In January, 1942, 1 was commissioned lieutenant (j.g.) U.S.N.R.
and ordered to active duty. I was returned to inactive duty in the
summer of 1946 with the rank of lieutenant commander.

Looking for greener pastures, I then set up as a manufacturer's
agent in Detroit. This venture was not too successful and early in
1947, I went to work in the field organization of Pontiac Motor
Division, General Motors Corporation. I stayed with Pontiac
until June, 1954. From that time until May of 1956, I worked in
various management capacities in retail automobile dealerships.
In June, 1956, I returned to General Motors and am on the faculty

AFTER the confusion of class day and graduation, I settled
down to the serious business of becoming a physician. Elarvard
Medical School was my choice, more perhaps because of amorous
feelings toward a young lady at Wellesley than because of the
magnetism of Boston. My family in Cincinnati, being solidly
German and very self sufficient and thrifty, thought I was mad
to stay in the East so long. However, as it turned out, I gained
a wife and a background that is probably responsible for my
present position. Fortunately, I was not disinherited. After
graduating from the Medical School, Sue and I traveled back
to Cincinnati where I began my internship and residency train-
ing in internal medicine, and she, her chemical work which gained
her a Ph.D. in biochemistry. After five years of postgraduate
training, I entered upon a career of academic medicine at the
University of Cincinnati. There is no need to recount the
numerous positions and titles I have held. Suffice it to say that
I worked at all levels of medical education and learned the
business from the bottom up. I founded one of the divisions
in the Department of Internal Medicine, University of Cincin-
nati, that of hematology and nutrition, and for ‘eleven Vears
served as its director, begging and cajoling sufficient funds from
research foundations, drug companies and generous private donors
to keep it going for the glory of medical research. My associates
and I did a lot of research, gained some recognition, made many
mistakes, but had a fine and exciting time of it. However, no
world-shaking discoveries were made and no one offered us a
Nobel prize. At the same time I was involved in medical school
administration in the dean’s office, in an active teaching schedule
and in a consultation practice. The latter not only served to keep
the wolf away from the door but also kept me attuned to the
needs of patients, and prevented construction of the ivory tower
in which full-time medical educators are so often suspected of
residing.

Perhaps the most exciting experiences of my life were broughe

[ 1129 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

about by my interests in human nutrition. I was asked to make
a survey on pellagra and nutritional anemias in Egypt for WHO
in 1954 and to study the anemia of Kwashiorkor (severe protein
malnutrition of infants and children) in Guatemala for the Pan
American Sanitary Commission in 1955. Sue accompanied me on
both trips. We found Fgypt fascinating, not only because of
the tremendous amount of disease bred by poverty, but also
because of the grandeur long since past. While we were there,
a rebirth of nationalism was evident in the people who had
time to think of other things than how to get the next meal,
and since Americans were still considered to be Egypt’s friends,
we were escorted to all the places of interest from Alexandria
to Aswan, The large and detailed report of our trip, I am sure,
now rests in some inaccessible file in Alexandria or Cairo, a fate
which has befallen many similar reports and recommendations.

The trip to Guatemala, while not as exciting, was of much
greater value. Here we were greeted most cordially, and found
a people anxious to learn. Suggestions for research which were
made on the basis of this survey are being carried out now, and
one of the very bright Guatemalan physicians with whom I
worked is now a “medical fellow” in my department in Cincinnati.

In 1956, upon the retirement of my long-time friend and
teacher, Dr. M. A. Blankenhorn, I was honored by the invitation
of the faculty to become professor and director of the Depart-
ment of Internal Medicine. It is an active, energetic, young
department and we are busily engaged in changing everything
that we had wanted changed for the past twenty years. The
dean, I am sure, considers us slightly mad.

On occasion, Sue teaches Christianity, and general science when
Hillsdale School loses its science teacher (two out of the last
three years). Our son, Billy, is in Walnut Hills High School and
at the age of fourteen is developing into quite a poised and self-
assured lad. I hope he too can have the opportunities of an edu-
cation in an institution like Harvard.

In the summers I fish, sail and swim for a month in Michigan
where we have a cottage on Lake Leelanau. Raising flowers is
my Cincinnati hobby because I’m still unsure of the Ohio River
as a sporting area. In the winter I have little time for anything
but work.

I WAS graduated from Cornell University Medical College in
1937, having spent most of the summer of 1935 walking and rid-
ing a bicycle in the Black Forest in Germany. Two years in the
Cincinnati General Hospital and three more in the General Hos-
pital in Louisville, Kentucky, were spent trying to learn to be a
surgeon, but the war interrupted things and my career as a Navy
doctor began in 1942.

Duty on a destroyer took me to the South Pacific where I found
tropical isles are not idyllic, but may be interesting, as was a native
medical school on Fiji Islands and a leper colony near New Cale-
donia. Naval hospitals at Great Lakes and on both coasts com-
pleted my tour of duty. Accordingly, in early 1946, I returned
to Louisville, to relearn some surgery, and for three months in the
summer of 1947, my family and I, with the help of a housetrailer,
“saw the West,” visiting eleven of our National Parks. This trip

fering with picnics, swimming, horseback riding, ice skating, and,

for the past four years, skiing with my daughters. A couple of

years ago we found it necessary to push the walls of the house out

a few feet to make room for our young son. I have now made

eight consecutive trips around Pikes Peak with the Pikes Peak

Range Riders and enjoy riding horseback with my three daughters

almost every day in the summer. Both riding and skiing enable

me to enjoy the out-of-doors and the magnificent Colorado moun-

tain scenery all four seasons. When J am too infirm to get out of
doors I will spend more time in photography and building my
model railroad. Fortunately, our life here in the West has been
for the last decade a fulfillment of our ideals —a “way of life,”
we had hoped for. Admittedly, there is some escapism for me,
especially playing Sunday cowboy helping rancher friends work
cattle. These activities I justify in the belief that my heart attack
is being postponed and the waistline kept slim, Honestly, it’s good
fun. We are happy that it was unnecessary to give up things cul-
tural to enjoy this “way of life” and we enjoy the local symphony
orchestra, Fine Arts Center, and many other similar worth-while
things here in Colorado Springs. In 1956, I built the Madison
Medical Building to get away from the problem of downtown
parking and so far the responsibilities of being a landlord have
not detracted from the joys of easy parking and driving home
for lunch.

Through experiences in traumatic surgery, I have become more
and more concerned with the problem of automotive safety. My
interest in this field has impelled me to try to help disseminate in-
formation about automotive crash injury research. In November
of 1957, | attended the third annual Automotive Crash and Field
Demonstration Conference at the Aero-Medical Field Laboratory
of the Air Force Missile Development Center, Air Research and
Development Command, Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico.
Our host, Colonel John Stapp, MC, U.S. Air Force, is a dedicated
man who is an inspiration to meet.

I voted for Herbert Hoover in 1932, and have become more and

influenced me in the past sixteen years, as she is even more con-
servative than I. We are both very much disturbed about the fact
that approximately half of the national debt has been given to
foreign countries since 1946.

If our plans materialize, I hope to take my entire family to the
Scandinavian countries, Denmark and northern Germany, England
and Scotland, immediately following our Reunion festivities. In
Stockholm, I will attend a meeting of the American College of

MY business career has been limited to one company, the United
Shoe Machinery Corporation. However, a surprising variety
of enterprise has been involved. After the usual course of sprouts
at the main office in Boston and a couple of years at a branch
office in Milwaukee, I returned to Boston and became engaged
in the development of neoprene adhesives for attaching soles
to shoes. This also entailed a line of machinery for the purpose.

Next I was assistant in a department watching over factory
trial of experimental shoe machinery. The advent of World
War II ended this, and I became a technical representative for
my company working under the auspices of the Air Service
Command, We furnished the hydraulic-powered gun mounts

[ 1134]

for the then secret squadron of YB-qgo’s. This was a rebuilt B-17
with sixteen fifty-calibre guns, most of which were mechanically
fed ammunition from the bomb-bay. I went to England with
this squadron in the spring of 1943 and worked through the
summer and fall on maintenance of its armament. The planes
served the purpose very nicely. They flew “tail-end Charlie” in
the B-17 formations, fell back when Jerry fighters came in and
then clobbered them. In the late fall the P-38 fighters arrived

from Africa and the YB-qo’s were retired. I returned to the
States and finished out the war as a project manager for my

company’s research contract with the Navy.
After the war I was transferred to research management for

the various subsidiary companies of the corporation. This in-
volved wood heels, lasts, bowling pins, shoe boxes, brushes, lez-
forms, fish-hooks, shoe repair machinery, eyelets, tacks, nails
etc., etc.! The variety was endless, A misunderstanding w ith

the Federal Government about monopoly led us from this to a
search for fertile fields for diversification. Our expericnce nn
automatic handling of fasteners in shoe machines led to the de-
velopment of a line of hand-held, automatic feed, pow er-driven

fastening machines driving tacks, nails and screws. T was again
project manager for this work. The machines are now ap-
pearing on the market. You will hear of them soon. Now we
are casting about for more new fields.

Our daughter finishes at Farmington this year. The boy has
wo more years at Milton Academy. This business of boarding
chool makes it mighty quiet and lonesome at home. However,
otal compatibility of those left behind has its rewards. We tan-
ze to get on the water a bit out of Manchester Harbor and to

IF I reach 1976, the bicentennial of our country’s independence,
I promise then to spend the first few days of my retirement-at-
sixty- -five writing lengthier memoirs. Until then, suffice to say
it’s been a fast nigh quarter century with little time for looking
back.

Virtually my entire business career has been with Johns-Man-
ville, after a short stint following graduation operating a jack
hammer on a Brooklyn railway job. Starting as a research en-
gineer with JM, I didn’t take long to realize that I preferred
the promotional end of the business, dealing with the animate
rather than the inanimate, Hence, the past score years have
been devoted to helping put asbestos-cement pipe—or more
specifically, “transite” — in its rightful place in the American
construction economy.

As to avocational pursuits, our single greatest purpose has
been in the field of mental health, attempting to awaken public
awareness of its responsibility in the treatment of mental illness,
with particular emphasis on improving care and therapy in public
hospitals, and in furthering research to find answers to this too-
neglected health problem. The strides currently made are gratify-
ing and augur well for the future. Perhaps the day will yet

I ENTERED medical school after graduation. In childhood, I
had somehow acquired the idea that I would “doctor” when I
grew up and I’d never seriously wavered from it.

Student years and postgraduate years of hospital work and
study continued until World War II. The war years were spent
in the Marine Hospitals of the U.S. Public Health Service, caring
for men and women of the U.S, Coast Guard and Merchant Ma-
rine. At the war’s end, I felt I would probably be happier doing
hospital medicine rather than private practice. Accordingly, I
joined the Medical Service of the U.S. Veterans Administration
and have stayed with it. I am certified as a specialist in internal
medicine, and, for the past four years, have been chicf of the
medical service in a rooo-bed V.A. neuropsychiatric hospital.

In 1950, after the flight of too much time, I marricd. The yeurs

known. I suppose I am essentially a “family man.” My wife is a
wonderful girl, a graduate of Harvard Medical School, Class of

what we hopefully term “preventive psychiatry.”

Outside of my professional activities, I garden with happy de-

All in all, I feel very thankful for what I have.

LOOKING back over twenty-five years is, I find, a sobering
experience. It’s not so much that it waxes a memory that al-
ready shows signs of slipping! Mostly it’s the simple, discourag-
ing fact that those good old undergraduate days were that long

[ 1138 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

ago. Could it be that others, too, have noticed the almost start-
ling frequency with which reminders of events of twenty,
twenty-five, thirty years ago seem to be turning up these days?
And am I imagining things, or is there beginning to be a vaguely
uneasy aura of tempus fugit about them? (Let’s make a gentle-
men’s agreement not even to mention our outright shock when
the event in question turns out to have been forgotten com-
pletely!)

Guess it’s all part of growing older. Certainly that in itself is
both challenging and sobering: challenging in its opportunities
to improve, to be helpful, to do something worthwhile, sobering
in its constant reminders of that relentless shift in the balance
between Time Past and Time to Come.

So much for philosophizing. Harvard was indeed good to me.
I may have long since forgotten most of whatever learning I
managed to cram in, but hardly such happy experiences as plaving
in the band (Leroy Anderson was in it, too, back then); or help-
ing Bob Huntsman and others earn our way by running the old
Students Laundry on Massachusetts Avenue; or being lucky
enough, along with several other classmates, to “christen” Eliot
E-51 and E-52, that entry’s whole top floor, for the first two
years of occupancy. (Passing thought: wonder whether I could
still climb four flights, up and down, several times a day? Once
a day? Once?)

The Great Depression was still very much around when we
graduated. However, Charlie Stokes and I somehow contrived
to wind up not only with similar jobs, but still rooming together
— “trainees” with the “odd-lot” firm of DeCoppet and Doremus
in New York City. (Seems to me I also remember George Wahl,
another Eliot E-51 stalwart putting his engineering know-how to
the test on a W.P.A. construction project, not far away!) In my
case, one cold (and I do mean cold) winter's exposure to the
mad uncertainties of Wall Street was enough. The following
spring I leaped at the chance to put my math background to
practical use, as an actuarial student in the Prudential's Newark
home office. I'd hardly been gone two weeks when certain
dreaded new S.E.C. regulations came through—and heaven
knows how many young ‘hopeful Wall Streeters sudde ‘nly found
themselves just hopeful and young!

IN late August ’34, I finished my “formal” schooling with a
summer school geological-field trip. The employment situation
being what it was, I held a string of jobs as salesman with a
couple of random periods of unemployment. By mid-1940, I
decided that it was high time I set about brushing-up on being
the artilleryman that my reserve commission said I was, so on
July 15, 1940, I reported for extended active duty at Fort Ethan
Allen, Vermont. Since then my travels have taken me over most
of the States, to Panama, to North Africa and Italy, to Japan
and Korea and to Germany (from where I returned in July of
this year). Included was a tour of duty as assistant professor of
military science at Harvard. In 1933 I certainly never expected
to be a member of such an august body as the Harvard faculty.
But now comes “Engine Charlie” and his RIF; by the end of
this month I shall have been relieved from active duty as a
lieutenant colonel. With seventeen years plus paid up on a
twenty-year annuity, | can’t afford to let it lapse, so the day after

DURING college I became increasingly eager to move outside
the New York-New England world in which I had grown up,
and in my senior year I changed all my studies from physics
to Mining Geology. In June, 1933, I felt fortunate indeed to
have actually found a job —=3in a zinc mine in Tennessee. Aly
hands and my back were in good shape from rowing, and it was
no hardship to spend the first four months after college break-
ing and shoveling zinc ore for 15¢ a ton, 1100 feet underground,
getting the necessary “practical experience.”

After Tennessee came a wonderful two years wandering over
the length and breadth of California and Oregon with a gold
prospecting crew. Outdoors all the time, in the snow of the
Sierras and the heat of the desert.

The business side of mining appeared to be vastly more protic
able than the scientific, and gradually the thought grew — why
should not I too be a “big successful businessman! Harvard
Business School lent me all my tuition and provided me with a
good self-help job for two years. Those two years were stumulac-
ing and absorbing, but the following period of financial work
with the American Smelting & Refining Co, in New York was
dull beyond words. -

[ 1143 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

I started taking evening courses in Physics at Columbia, and
finally worked there full-time. What a contrast! I studied under
some of the greatest scientists in the world, and spent the years of
the great war teaching Physics and Electronics to Navy engineers.

After the war, our growing family pushed us from the city
to the beautiful ridges of Connecticut, and the effort to provide
for the things that three daughters need led me from teaching
to industry.

My work is creative and original and fun —I enjoy it greatly.
Outside my work, my life at home seems to grow fuller and more
distracting every day! We have three vigorous, sociable teen-age
daughters, The two older ones are busy in school at Andover,
Mass. (meeting hundreds of boys). At each vacation time, watch-
ing the traffic through our house, we say hopefully “it can’t get
any worse than this!”

Adele and I have long admired modern architecture and now
we have moved to a house that is only 208 years old, and needs
a lifetime of repairs. But the fields and woods are lovely, and deer
come up to lick our salt-block.

I have too many hobbies and am no good at any of them,
photography, music, nature, skiing, ice-skating and canoeing. I
get good tennis all year round — competitive singles help to keep
me from going downhill too fast.

Commuting to and from New York is rather peaceful. After I
get home I usually run along back country roads for ten minutes
or so. Or, in the summer I have tennis or swimming. After supper
the maintenance and repairs are likely to take over, unless we
rush forth to some community affair.

Weekends go by so fast that I seldom get to Saturday’s paper
till Monday. We greatly enjoy New York — the opera, theatre,
friends— and about once a week we have an evening in the
city. In the winter we all go north for a week of family skiing.
In the summer Adele and I usually take a canoe trip by ourselves,
in Canada or northern Maine. We have a light 17 foot aluminum
canoe that is a joy to carry. Iwo summers ago we all had a
fine family camping trip across the country with our girls. A
big trailer which I built, subdivided into eight compartments,
carried all our equipment and personal items. We camped in

the great National Parks, swam in the Pacific, rode at a ranch
in Montana for ten days and met boys!

Life is going by far too fast, and I can’t jam into it much more
at present. Someday I hope to do a great deal more travel, and
some interesting climbing. Social, political and religious views:
I think that fundamental Christian ideals of concern for one’s
neighbors are growing and spreading all over the world . . . not
only in the Democratic countries, but also in the Communist
lands and in the jungle. Our form of society can learn some-
thing from the Communist emphasis on education and service to
the community. Their society will certainly be influenced by
our ideals of personal freedom and individual responsibility to
our Creator. Gradually, these views will be reconciled and I
believe the best values of each will prevail.

LIFE has been abroad in remote mining districts of the world:

and the Amazonas Territory of Venezuela, rain forest areas of
British Guiana, the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan, des-
erts and beaches of Australia, the Oubanghi Chari and Congo of
French Equatorial Africa, Formosa and, at present, life and work
continues in the alti-plano of Bolivia. Throughout the rigors of
life as a mining engineer there have been good partners; a wife
and three children. They learned how to keep panthers from
entering our home at the diamond mines of French Equatorial
Africa by burning kerosene lanterns throughout each night. Two
children were born in Cuba during an assignment to produce
manganese and chrome ores for the war effort. A third child was
born on the Red Sea while his parents were in transit to India.
He crossed Khyber Pass at the age of ten days. :

This life in undeveloped countries has provided opportunities
and time to enjoy many unusual pleasures and activities. The
family was generally too remote from modern civilization to be
molested by the ring of the telephone. When moves were neces-
sary from one mining district to another, about five tons of bag-
gage sealed in steel drums went too. These drums contained the
essentials necessary for comfortable living: food, clothing and
about 1,000 choice books. Until recently the children knew no
school but their mother’s and what they could learn themselves
through experiences out-of-doors. The American Museum of
Natural History, New York, has encouraged their findings and
has received many specimens, both dead and alive, of the critters
the wife of a mining engineer encounters while housecleaning
abroad.

IN the fall of 1933, 1 arrived in New York to start a career in
the theatre. While at college, I had played for three summers at
the Wharf Theatre in Provincetown, Massachusetts. Through
the professional contacts there, I obtained my first speaking role
in a play called “Mahogany Hall.” The memorable date of that
opening was January 17, 1934, at the Bijou Theatre. “Ragyed
Army,” and “Let Freedom Ring” followed. As a member of the
Actors’ Repertory Company, I played in “Bury the Dead,” “200
Were Chosen” and a joint production with the Theatre Guild of

[ 1147]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

“Washington Jitters.” The plays “Excursion,” “Everywhere I
Roam,” and “First Stop To Heaven” were some of my: other
major productions in New York. Over the years, the summers
were, of course, taken up with summer stock either at the Bar-
ter Theatre, Abingdon, Virginia, Repertory Playhouse Asso-
ciates, Putney, Vermont, or The Show Shop, Canton, Connecticut.
On February 16, 1942, I enlisted in the U.S. Navy and began
“boot” training at Newport, Rhode Island. After instruction at
the Naval Training School, Bedford Springs, Pennsylvania, I
became a radio operator. Soon after I was appointed RM 3c
and reported aboard U.S.S. LST 384 for duty. After the com-
missioning of my vessel, we were sent to Africa. Then in rapid
order, we participated in the invasions of Scogletti, Sicily, and
Salerno and Anzio, Italy. On June 6, 1944, I was commended for
conduct in action during the invasion of France at Normandy.
After my ship received a direct hit by a V-1 bomb, orders for
my commission came through and I returned to the States. Then
I became attached as communications officer to Commander Car-
rier Division 14 aboard the aircraft carrier, USS. Mindoro.
After a little more than four years of active duty, I received my
release from the Navy in 1946.

I then began studying for my Master’s degree at Columbia
University and received the degree in May of 1947. In Septem-
ber, I became associated with the Speech and Dramatic Art De-
partment of Douglass College, Rutgers University, filling the po-
sition of assistant professor these last years and having just con-
cluded four years as a visiting lecturer in some very rewarding
part-time teaching at the Princeton Theological Seminary.

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

occuPATION: Engineering supervisor, Missiles Engineering Department,
Douglas Aircraft Company.

MEMBER OF: Institute of Radio Engineers; Harvard Club of Southern Cali-
fornia; Harvard Engineering Society.

I THINK that the one thing we of the Class of 1933, graduating
as we did in the depth of the depression, can appreciate more than
most other classes is a good job. It took me about two years to
land one, but since February of 1935, I have been fortunate enough
to be continually employed in what I considered to be engaging
work, The scientific graduate of today, courted by dozens of
corporations and institutions, can never experience the thrill we
had when we secured our first professional position.

My first really professional effort was with the Los Angeles
Bureau of Power and Light as a field engineer during the con-
struction of the 187,000-volt power transmission line from Boulder
Dam to Los Angeles. To be associated with what was then the
largest power and reclamation project ever undertaken was stim-
ilating to me in my early twenties and what was more, it paid
3135 a month. I bought a car on that salary and lived it up when
could get into Los Angeles weekends.

Upon completion of the project, I joined the telephone com-
any. Since my field at Harvard was electronics, communications
-emed much more appropriate than the mega-watts of Boulder
am. During this period, I had the interesting task of engincering
e original telephone systems for several communities which are
ow popular California desert resorts.

My home has always been in Los Angeles, but all my life I have
en in love with San Francisco. In order to live there for awhile,
ook a position with the state regulatory commission for public
lities. The job was a bit dull but living in the bay area was all
xpected it to be. However, the job didn’t last long because
cember 7, 1941, came along.

applied for a commission in the Navy, got it, and was on active
y by April. I was naturally channeled into military clectronics
| my first duty was to act as commanding officer of a sub-
‘ine detection station at the entrance to the Golden Gate. In-
ntally, I was not even a ninety-day wonder. I had had no
nal naval training of any kind and did not during my entire
of duty. Needless to say, I learned navy procedures and

[ 1149 ]

customs the hard way. Later on, I was stationed at the Puget
Sound Navy Yard and in the Aleutians as an electronics officer.
I always regretted I didn’t get duty in some more exotic part of
the world. However, I enjoyed my time in the Navy and even
thought some of staying in after the war. I was separated toward
the end of 1945 as a lieutenant commander.

I was determined not to return to the utility business but to
find something more exciting and more advanced scientifically. I
found it at the Douglas Aircraft Company where I am sull em-
ployed. I was fortunate enough to get into the very beginning of
guided missile development in this country. I believe that from an
engineering standpoint, it would be difficult to find a more chal-
lenging field. I have had the opportunity to engage in both de-
sign and flight testing. I spent something like two years at White
Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico, firing the original NIKE
missiles and am at present frequenting Cape Canaveral, Florida, in
connection with the Thor project. We have always had our oc-
casional panics in the missile business but since Sputnik, it has
been a continual one. Nevertheless, I think Pll stick with it if I
can continue to stand the pace. I’m sure anything else would
seem dull.

There is not much to say about my personal life. I have re-
mained a bachelor and spend my spare time (which is practically
nil since Sputnik) maintaining my garden and orchard, sailing,
surfing and playing poker. Several of you will remember that I
was a hi-fi fan in college (they didn’t call it that then). I still am
and still build my own equipment. I have not been very active in
local Harvard affairs although I am a Harvard Club bondholder
and recently have been soliciting donations to the Program for
Harvard College. .

IT would be hard to imagine how anyone could possibly have
concentrated in French History and Literature while in col-
lege, yet followed a life like mine after graduation. T guess that
the secret must lie in the keen interest I've always had in trying to
understand the world around us. This led me to take lots of
geology and geography as an undergraduate and then two years
more of it in graduate school. My first hope for a really worth:
while and interesting life’s work developed while teaching at
Dr. A. Hamilton Rice’s Institute of Geographical r tploration at
Harvard in the late thirties. But this transient dream faded, then

dicant, educator, businessman, scientist and politician — with the
hours of a doctor and a priest. We still aren’t surprised when the
telephone rings at three o’clock in the morning and a frantic
voice queries, “How in Heaven’s name do I go about getting a
skunk out of our area-way. My husband’s given up — he’s taking
a shower and we're going to burn up his clothes. We've just
got to do something!”*

*It’s a cinch. Just go down cellar, get a good long plank (an ironing-
board is fine if you're really desperate), shove it quickly into the hole on
the diagonal and beat a hasty retreat. Any intelligent skunk takes care
of the rest himself.

TWENTY-FIVE years after graduation finds me, surprisingly,
a “most happy fella.” The years have treated me more kindlv
than I had anticipated. The despair and gloom of 1933 seem to be
vanishing with each passing year.

After graduation, I spent part of one year at Boston University
Graduate School. doing biochemical research. There follow ed,
then, four years at Tufts Medical School and, thanks to the
N.Y.A. (35¢ an hour), I had spending money and an occasional
date. My internship, which paid $10.00 per month, hardly made
me wealthy, so I accepted a job in a state hospital to accumulate
a pre-practice bank balance. There, with unusual cunning, |
city-slicked a sweet, simple country gal, a Simmons alumna, into
abandoning her career as a medical technician and becoming my
wife. This has been my smartest move in an otherwise plod ling
career.

In December, 1941, about a year after my marriage, I left my
state hospital job and went to work for a tuberculosis county hos-
pital but, then, six days later, the war was on. I was declared

“essential” and was immobilized for four years, thus becoming an

[rigs]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

expert in chest diseases and some other medical matters. Ulti-
mately, the atom bomb fell. I was released from my “essential”
status and in December, 1945, opened my office for the practice
of internal medicine.

About this time, I became an instructor of medicine at Tufts
Medical School, a position which I have somewhat stagnantly
maintained over these twelve years. Gradually, too, 1 acquired
staff status in various hospitals, even becoming consultant to some.
At the Quincy City Hospital, I have risen to the rank of senior
visiting physician. At the Boston State Hospital, in addition to
my staff appointment, I became vice-president of the executive
committee.

During my stay at the county hospital (1941-45), I began
to write popular science and medical articles for national lay
magazines and, in the first few years of my medical practice, I
was able to keep the wolf from the door by pounding away at
an old battered Underwood. In recent years, the pressure of
practice has all but halted my literary output. Still, at present,
I am negotiating for publication of my third book (Fables for
Doctors and Patients) and am trying to promote a daily syn-
dicated medical column.

My civic interests have centered largely around the Quincy
Jewish Community Center. Some of my closest friendships have
stemmed from this source. Having served on several committees
and having been elected three times to the board of directors, I
feel that, to some extent, I have worked for the community in
which I live. My wife has shared in this endeavor, having served
as president of the Sisterhood of the Center, but her civic in-
terests are even broader and more extensive than mine.

Basically, though, I am a family man. I shamelessly love my
family and my home. Summers, we send the kids off to camp, but
every winter we pack our sacks and skis into the beach wagon
and, as a family, go to New Hampshire for a week of skiing and
outdoor fun. This winter activity has now become almost a
tradition, and we hope to enjoy it a few more years before each
of our children goes his separate way. Our summer vacations
center mostly around Cape Cod where we spend our weekends
loafing and fishing.

Philosophically, I have no broader ambition than to till the

[1156 ]

soil to the best of my ability, in my own backyard. Wile
horizons no longer beckon me. I am quite content where | am.

MY business interest since college has been entirely insurance,
with the single exception of the five-year period immedi ately
following the war (that era was spent with the War Production
Board) when I was persuaded by the new young president of
Rexall Drug Company, successor to Liggett Drug Company, that
a New Englander born and bred was just the one to move to
Los Angeles, new headquarters for Rexall as of October, 1945.

We made the move, with our four children and as many dogs
and all the maudlin possessions a family acquires. The move was
for good. We bought a wonderful house — best we'll ever have.
The oldest children, then nine, seven and six, loved the school on
the edge of Santa Monica and L. A. We had swimming, beth pool
and ocean, within sight, Leo Carillo’s horses to use next door,
tennis and golf all around us and famous characters coming out of
our ears (a lot of them we never met, but it all added up to glare
our). What a king-size life!

Twenty months later Ellie and I looked at each other sudddenty
one day and said, “What are we doing here? Where could we tind
a sleet storm, and an ocean that really smells saltv? Plow quick
can we get ‘home’>” Four months later we were back cast in

[1157 ]

New York state and in another three years back in Massachusetts,
in fact the same town we'd left. The moral? We don’t know
exactly what it is ourselves. We're glad we stirred our stumps,
and almost ashamed that southern California failed to appeal. In
our much less exciting surroundings here, when we skate and ski
and sail it somehow seems real and natural, although technically
you can do them all out there —and we did. Must be something
about old dogs and new tricks.

Those nine and seven and six-year-olds are now Connecticut
College, Harvard and Cornell respectively. We wait eagerly for
their return at vacations, plus the return of a Kent School third-
former, and then shudder when the longed-for avalanche descends.
Will there ever be enough cars, clothes, guest rooms, blankets,
skis, telephones, tuition dollars? We're never sure. We're very
lucky — they’re all wonderful characters, so far, and if I can do
my part as well as Ellie has always done hers we should continue
to have a lot to be thankful for.

Politics? It seems harder as time goes on to say what your
beliefs are. P've worked for the Republican party from time to
time, but it’s been the men, the Herters and Fisenhowers, that
have made it seern worthwhile. Church-wise our affiliation has
always been Protestant Episcopal —I think I got there more often
when I was a vestryman for several years. Maybe I should be
back in harness again. Perhaps we're better at everything when
we're knee-deep in everything, but at other times I think it must
have been great in the horse and buggy days when one didn’t try
to spread oneself so thin. Maybe at our Twenty-fifth someone
can tell me what's happened to those “long winter evenings.”

IT was the fact that the only college recruiter that I was able to
find to interview in that spring of 733 (how times have chanyed’)
offered a job in Procter and Gamble that started my continuing
employment i in the manufacturing and technical portion of the
soap industry. Despite the canard that anyone can make seap
but it takes a genius to sell it, the intervening years have sce
a succession of assignments that have added up to a satisfying
and stimulating career.

The day I got off the train to start work here in July of °33
it was 108° —and to a New Englander that was a fitting intro-
duction to the new home in that hazy area beyond the Hladson.
After seven years, and as little of the month of July each year as
possible, in manufacturing and technical positions, the then
family of three moved to Staten Island for a further six vears. As
most of that time was spent as factory superintendent in an es-
sential industry, my war experience amounted only to Red Cros
volunteer work in service hospitals in the area. After an eightcen-
month sojourn in Milton, devoted for the most part to rebroaden-
ing my A’s, and the rest of the time as superintendent of our
Quincy factory, we, by now five in number, returned toe Cin-
cinnati. Two years in purchasing of commodities have been ful-
lowed since 1950 with responsibility for technical assistance ta the

our growth cause an increase in the size of the groupe. amd the

as the past.

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

Since I married the daughter of a Yale dean, at least my seats
for the game are on the fifty-yard line, even if my outbursts of
enthusiasm do not coincide with those of the neighboring view-
ers. With Martha finishing high school this year, the problem of
entrance into college of the next generation is squarely before
us, with no time yet for concern about affording it for all three.
As Lee is started on football with some prospects of success
even now as a freshman, perhaps the problem will solve itself,
though I fear his present scholastic record may lead elsewhere
than Cambridge. Jane is barely a teen-ager, but so far the prob-
lems seem fewer — perhaps we're inured.

Hobbies are golf, bridge and stamps. Am an accumulator of
the last with a dim hope that perhaps in a few years retirement
will be relieved by the emergence of one more mail-order stamp
dealer in New England (or even northern California, as the clos-
est approximation found as yet without that December-March
hiatus to pleasant living). Since the almost daily pleas for com-
pletion of this recital have finally moved hand to paper, sobeit —
but where did the twenty-four years go?

EXCEPT for two nasty old wars (or one war and one police
action, if you prefer), mine was the typical quiet and unevent-
ful life of a country school teacher (subject: high school French)
until 1954. Of course, certain things of some significance did take
place during that period, such as, for example, the acquisition
of three redheads (one wife and two children, assorted). But by
and large — except for those two N.O.W. — life was simple and
with little worry other than how to feed a family on a teacher’s
salary.

In 1954, after twenty years in high school, I finally moved on
to college — Lowell Technological Institute. Here, under the
alias of coordinator of special services, I direct the public rela-
tions program of a state engineering school presided over by an-
other Harvardman. (Got any youngsters who want a degree in
electronics, leather, nuclear, paper/ plastics, or textile enginecr-
ing? We'll take good care of them!) Gone, of course, are the
quiet days; at times I would gladly move the office to a nice
peaceful madhouse. But the work is interesting, never monot-
onous and infinitely challenging — as well as damn frustrating!

Now as for those nasty old wars: As ensign and lieutenant
(j.g.) U.S.N.R., from 1943 to 1946 I enjoyed (?) a brief tour of
North Atlantic DD duty and a year and a half in the Southwest
Pacific island-hopping as an assault beachmaster from New
Guinea through the Philippines to Japan. In 1951 I was recalled
to active duty with the Amphibious Force Atlantic Fleet, serving
as operations and plans officer of Naval Beach Group Two. Re-
call did not dampen my enthusiasm for the Naval Reserve; it has
continued to be my main outside interest. I am particularly proud
that the surface division of which I was C.O. from 1954 to 197
was the outstanding division in the First Naval District all three
years.

Although I have managed to retain all my hair and teeth and
a reasonable waistline, I felt real old last September when daugh-
ter Claire matriculated at Jackson College. Now I find myself
thinking more and more about retirement — yet many years

five years have been good. I’m looking forward to the next

twenty-five.

IN looking back over the past twenty-five years, I find that at
times the period seems brief, while again it seems like an eternity.
The later years have a habit of slipping quietly away with very
little to show for their passing.
After a brief encounter with insurance (claim adjusting)

and teaching (English and history) immediately following gradu-
ation, I turned to mechanical engineering, which I studied nights
while working days—a very good way to drive your wife to
the edge of insanity via boredom and frustration, as I found out.
A few years at G.E. in West Lynn and at Reed-Prentice in
Worcester preceded my entry into the Navy in 1942. Indoc-
trination was at Cornell, followed by Salvage and Diving School
on Pier 88, home of the capsized Normandie. Both salvage work
and diving proved intriguing, even though subsequent duty tours
took me to tidewater Virginia in July and August, and to Ar-
gentina, Newfoundland and Dutch Harbor, Alaska, for year-
round chilliness. |

In November, 1945, I returned home and worked for Mathew-
son Machine Works in North Quincy, and later for the Rex
Corporation in West Acton. For the past few years I have had
my own engineering firm so that I can enjoy the overwhelming
agony of all major decisions (mostly wrong ones) as well as the
isual frustrations of trying to engineer anything at all.

My son, John, is now a senior at Rensselaer Polytechnical In-

ner School of Floral Design. As a result, my wife, Ethel, has been
the recipient of more corsages (and darned good ones, too) in
the past few months than she has received in the last twenty
years. A hobby, of late, has been singing with the Concord
Chorus. In the 1954-55 season our regular director, Nancy Lor-
ing, arranged for us to sing under the direction of Doc Davison
at a series of Lowell Institute Lectures, a most interesting ex-
perience.

THEY say that time flies. This has been proven in these last
twenty-five years; and yet, when I look back over this period,
I find I have enjoyed a rich life full of happiness and conrentment.
Half of these years have been spent in New England, the other
half in sunny California. Because of this we have traveled across
the country many times. Now I find my hobby is flying through
necessity and through personal choice.

Between my job and my family life I have found little time
for anything else. Life at times can be so complicated by partich
pating in too many activities. I have resigned mysclf to the coun-
try for outdoor living whenever I can get away from the office.
For me a simple life seems to be the best. "

SINCE graduation I have been associated with my father in the
management of our family timberland business. Being the fourth
generation to follow this line of work, I decided to return to
Bangor and carry on our family traditions. In 1935 I met and
married my beautiful and charming southern wife from Spar-
tanburg, South Carolina. We have been very happy and have
been blessed with a full and active life. We are especially proud
of our two children, Emily, now a junior at the University of
North Carolina, and John, who in two years will attend Phil-
lips Exeter, later Harvard (?).

Having lived in a relatively small city of 40,000 population,
and having some extra time because of the seasonal nature of our
business, I have taken a very active part in community affairs.
For many years I have served as director in various charities and
about ten years ago I experienced a brief political whirl on the
Bangor City Council and in the Maine Legislature. Last January I
was happy to realize a life-long dream of becoming a bank di-
rector when I was elected to the board of the Merrill Trust Com-
pany, Maine’s second largest commercial bank. As I concentrated
at Harvard on economics and took a course in Money and Bank-

ing, I know that this background and preparation has been a
tremendous help to me in this new ficld.

My hobbies include golf (just an average game), working ant
gardening on my four-acre lot, and a twenty-four-ycar study of
common stocks. Stocks have always fascinated me and | muse
confess that many hours, probably too many, have been spent
trying to solve the mysteries.

Living in the rock-ribbed state of Maine, which has always
traditionally been Republican (except for an occasional mutake),
I have been a staunch Republican in my voting and party athia-
tions. As there has been some break-down in the presene por
litical lineup, no longer is it true that “as Maine goes so goes tie
Nation.” I have embraced the religious faith of my farchears,
which is the Congregational denomination, and have taken an
active part in its various activities, serving from collector ts
moderator, and as chairman of the finance committee In Faues a
large amount for a new and modern church school.

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

I have been an academic and I have been a bureaucrat. Each
calling tends to unfit one, in a way, for the other. No one who has
been acquainted with the fullness, grace and freedom that the
mind may enjoy at Harvard is likely to be fully content with
government service and the ways in which it must consider and
decide. No one who has served in the government and known
what E. M. Forster called “the urgent world of telegrams and
anger” will be wholly happy among ideas that are not seen as an
element in someone’s decision.

Since the last Class Report, I left the Department of State’s
Secretariat, where by luck I served for three years under General
Marshall and Dean Acheson, and went back to the international
information field. For five years I was various kinds of policy and
planning officer, concerned with things not very different from
those I had worked on in O.W.I. and its successors after leaving
Cambridge in 1943. I was a member of the U.S. Delegation to the
London meetings, in 1955, of the United Nations Disarmament
Subcommittee. Those three months added greatly to my educa-
tion; but we did not, unhappily, negotiate a disarmament agree-
ment with Mr. Gromyko. That same year I went into U.S.1.A.’s
research and intelligence office, where I am to this day.

Recent years have been more than interesting; but 1 sometimes
feel that it is like trying to tell time from inside the watch. Life at
home with one’s wife and four children becomes the measurable
and prized reality.

I could not choose between the bureaucratic and academic
halves of my life. Perhaps it would have been good to have the
two run more as concurrent, less as consecutive, halves. We may
need more public faces in academic places, to paraphrase; I know
we need more academic faces in public places.

AFTER graduation I went into chain department store work,

spending about four years with Montgomery Ward & Company

at their Elmira and Herkimer, New York, stores, and then a
few months with Lincoln Stores, Inc., at their Quincy, Massachu-
setts store. The course of my life underwent a drastic change
in April of 1937, when I had to leave my career, built up through

four years of hard work, to go south to regain my health, as wit-
nessed by my Army experience, and L enjoyed life here to
such an extent that it became home. This was the place and
here I have remained. I found employment with Pinchurst, Inc.
the operators of this winter resort. Except for an absence of
one year, while employed with the Hotel W endell, Patasfield.
Massachusetts, and of three years, while serving in the Army, I
have continued to live in Pinehurst and to work with Pinchunt,
Inc. My position with the corporation is internal auditer in the
Accounting Department. My induction into accounting came
from a correspondence course with the International Accountants
Society of Chicago, which I had begun prior to my army serv-
ice and completed after my service was finished.

Above I have given a brief outline of my life during the years
since graduation. Now a few details are in order. Vhe first and
most important item is that Dora G. Risley of Eluntington, New
York, and I were married in May, 1944, in New York City, white
I was on a delay en route to going overseas. T must hasten to
add that ours was not a sudden war marriage, since we had known
each other for a number of years before our marriage. Perhaps
it was providential that we were married at that time, becatce
my orders were eventually changed and I was sent to Cans
Gruber, Oklahoma, where I fi nished out the war. OF course,
I was proud to be selected to go overseas. At the lat moment
I was held back. My wife was teaching school at the Plate ore
School in Huntington at the time of our marrage and she pe:

[ 1167 ]

mained there until the end of the 1944-45 school year. She made
a few hectic train visits to Oklahoma during the school year.
She joined me in the summer of 1945 and we set up housekeepin
for the first time in an apartment in Muskogee, Oklahoma. In
September of that year I received my discharge from the Army
and we came to Pinehurst with the idea of my working for awhile
in one of the hotels before making up our minds about where
we would like to settle. In the fall of 1946, I accepted a position
as accountant in the general office of Pinehurst, Inc. My wife at
the same time accepted a teaching position with the local public
school. We soon entered into the life of the community. We
found our life pleasant and satisfying here. In 1953 we had our
house built and are now enjoying it to the fullest. It is worth
mentioning that our house is only a ten-minute walk from the
shopping centre, my office and the golf course.

As befits a resident of this so-called “Golf Capital of the
World,” my chief hobby is golf. I also have taken a great interest
in stamp collecting the past five years or so. It is not the best
hobby for one who is engaged in sedentary work, but I must say
it is relaxing and interesting. My church affiliation is Presbyterian
and my wife and I are members of the Pinehurst Community
Church. I have served as a director of the church and we both
have engaged in many of the church activities. As for politics,
I am interested in maintaining our American two-party system,
which seems to be making some headway in this state. I vote as
my conscience dictates.

PERHAPS I’m lucky. At any rate, I imagine that I'm one of the
few men who has, more or less successively, followed the carece
he envisioned while still in Cambridge. It hasn’t been casy — but
anyone who thinks advertising is an easy business should yet
his head examined. It has been rewarding, mostly in sense of
accomplishment, though I can’t complain of the other rewards
either. There have been ups and downs, but that’s part of any
business. As yet I do not have an ulcer, a home in Fairfield coun-
ty, nor a sports car. I don’t anticipate any of these, nor do 1 be-
lieve they are necessary for anyone in my business. I resent the
word “huckster” — but also know there are sufficient people,
both present and past, who have merited this term as applied to
advertising.

My home is happy, and a convenient ten-minute walk from
the office. My wife, my son, and an ancient spanicl coewst
contently and at times contentiously. We enjoy it. If I had it to
do all over again, I doubt if I would try to change the pattern
much. This isn’t being smug, it’s being realistic.

TELESCOPING twenty-five years into some twenty-five lines
is quite a challenge for a homo sapiens Harvardianus, a species
of whom so much is expected. But inasmuch as there must al-
ways be an exception to prove the rule, I find it quite simple to
present my simple biography within the set bounds. I prefer
to tell the truth rather than to parade under a facade of modesty.

The prospect of leaving the protective aegis of our alma mater
in 1933 to enter the cruel world of business at the height (or
was it depth) of the depression was too shocking to even con-
template, so, without dalliance, I matriculated at the Harvard
Law School, ostensibly (this means so I told the pater) to prepare
myself for economic independence. If independence means free-
dom, then upon receiving my LL.B and passing the Massachu-
setts bar, I had plenty of it—free time, free speech (there
was nobody around to interrupt) and free clients (mostly rela-
tives). All wasn’t black, however. I did get a case on a beau-
tiful maiden, sued for her hand and won, This might imply that
she lost, but for me she has never lost her appeal.

THE following is a brief sketch from 1933 to date, of myself,

my family, our way of life.

I was married after a year at Harvard Law School. I flunked
the Massachusetts Bar exams on first try, but a cram course sup-
plied the necessary local lingo and I passed on second try. Then
came three priceless years of legal training with the leading con-
veyance firm in Boston. In 1939 I became associated with the
“Welch Office,” which became Welch & Forbes on my father’s
death in 1948. I warmed a bench on the home front during the
war because of a knee injury.

Welch & Forbes is a combination trust and law office, but be-
ing neither, is uninhibited by the “legal mind” on the one hand or
the “banker’s mind” on the other. We, and those who have gone
before us, have been at it since about 1837. We cannot advertise,
as some of us are lawyers, nor do we wish to advertise. The
‘word of mouth” makes for more lasting, happier, business re-
lations. We care for many millions of other people’s property,
and devote much of our time to the varied problems of our
clients and their families. We know the members of our “office
families,” as my grandfather used to call his clients, personally,
and in many cases intimately. Because of this our clients rely
on us for all manner of things. We are skeptical of bigness as
it would destroy this useful and happy relationship. So much for
my own business.

My extra-curricular business activities are enjoyable and .
interesting. A day on the locks and canals of Lawrence, Massa-
chusetts, where the New England industrial revolution began,
or on Boston’s waterfront; or a trip through modern textile mills
in Georgia and Alabama, or a laboratory making a revolutionary
kind of filter, are all stimulating experiences. My non-business
extra-curricular activities are limited to those to which I have
time to contribute actively, Fifteen years’ service on my town’s
planning board has been most educational. There one acquires

[1174]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

insight into the growing pains of our country and the workings

of the “grass roots,” as well as patience and tolerance. Serving
on the board of our local hospital brings home the impact of in-
flation and the true cost of technological advances in medicine.
Running a Masonic lodge, a yacht club, and an ocean cruising
club have been a lot of fun.

My hobbies are sailing, cleaning up woods after hurricanes,
and working with my hands. The whole family loves the sea,
fortunately. Our greatest pleasure is cruising in a well-found
ship. Some of us ski, hunt, camp. We all enjoy music, books
travel. My family, thanks to my wife’s guiding hand at the
helm, is a “close-knit,” self-sufficient, happy one. We prefer
small group entertainment over the “cocktail party” type. Con-
vention is suspect; we like to ask “why, where, how?” We go
about our business quietly and with a will; a boat that lea cs
a big wake behind it is poorly designed. Life has been good
to us and we do our best to be good to it.

The foregoing is necessarily inadequate because it omits de-
tailed comments on the members of my family, each of whem is

a vital, ever-growing, wonderful person, and it also omits men-
tion of my partners and associates, each of whom is a Rock of
Gibraltar.

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

TO review the twenty-five years which have passed since 1933 is
an assignment which evokes mixed emotions — many goals unful- -
filled and yet some wonderful fulfillments. I suppose this is not
unique. In the bleak days of 1933 I felt fortunate to find my-
self on the payroll of the Dow Chemical Company in Midland,
Michigan. After three years in the organic research department,
and the acquisition of a wife, I decided to accept a position with
a small paint company in Detroit and to try my hand at the
manufacturing end of a business. Paint and particularly auto-
motive finishes remained my principal interest until ten years
ago. At that time I had the opportunity to gain an even more
independent working arrangement by acquiring a franchise in
the water conditioning business. I still have my fingers in
paint, however, and still manufacture several specialty items
which interest me scientifically and financially.

The rearing of our four children and our close family life have
been most rewarding and satisfying; not, however, without the
normal attendant headaches and pitfalls. My hobbies include
bridge, amateur dramatics, reading and golf. My main ambition
in this line is to play in the seventies, a goal I missed by one
stroke this summer. Civic interest, except for numerous small
demands which everyone encounters, has been focused on our
local library and its development.

THE Twenty-fifth Anniversary Report provides a good, if start-
ling opportunity to take stock of one’s life thus far. It scems
most convenient to divide this account of my evolution since
graduation into two parts: external facts and internal develop-
ment.

Married a week before Commencement, I spent the summer
and fall terms studying in the Graduate School in the Department
of Philosophy. In February, my wife and I left for Furope where
we remained for a year and one-half, I studied at the University

[1177 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

of Heidelberg and the University of London. In 1936 we re-
turned to the States and entered upon a career of high school
teaching which lasted until I went into the Army in 1943. I
was assigned to President Roosevelt’s personal bodyguard at
Hyde Park, where I remained until the President’s death. I was
on my way to the Pacific Theatre when the war ended. After
discharge I entered Columbia University under the G.I. Bill and
in two and one-half years won both of my advanced degrees.
While working for these degrees I taught at Columbia and at
the Jefferson School of Social Science. After 1950 I taught full
time at the latter school. In the past three years I have done very
little teaching and have concentrated on writing books and ar-
ticles. Three years ago we moved out of New York City to our
farm high in the Catskill Mountains, which we had previously
used as a summer home. Here we raise much of what we need,
have horses to ride and a good life for our three children. It is,
however, no idyl, but rather an almost endless round of hard
work, physical and mental. But as the old philosopher said, in
work alone is there real and enduring happiness. If that iS SO,
then we must be just about the happiest... . Such are the bare,
unadorned facts. Now for the real story. |
The course of my internal or intellectual development pro
ceeded along two lines which eventually merged, a political and
philosophical current of thought. Behind the two lines were
influences brought to bear already in undergraduate years. My
political orientation stemmed from extra-curricular exposure to
socialist thinking and I became a confirmed exponent of so-
cialism related to the Communist movement in the United
States. My socialist convictions have broadened and deepened
with the passage of time. The development of socialist, and
particularly of Communist thinking at Harvard is, of course,
nothing new. It has a long and honorable tradition stemming
from John Reed, It would be a sad day indeed for Harvard, and
other universities, if the intellectual ferment of free thought did
not give rise to unorthodox thinking especially of the political
left. The experience of the Great Depression and of the rise
of the Nazis, as witnessed in my sojourn in Germany, played no
small part in the making of a socialist. Today, I am more than
ever convinced that a socialist America would be a better

[ 1178 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

America. At the same time I am sure that we shall find our own
American and democratic way to socialism, a way consonant
with our great heritage and traditions of liberty.

Philosophically, my intellectual development began under
the influence and guidance of the late great Alfred North White-
head. His emphasis on a world view in which process, motion and
internal change were the essential features impressed me indcli-
bly. His method of dealing with process, the old formal-logical
method, however, led him to formulate more and more fantastic
hypotheses leading ultimately to the assumption of two Gods, one
of permanence and the other of change — an eclectic combina-
tion of Heraclitus and Parmenides. After wrestling for years
with the problem of how to avoid such unrealistic views, I final-
ly found a solution in the scientific philosophy of dialectical ma-
terialism, the Marxist world view. I found that the materialistic
dialectical method could adequately deal with change and pro-
cess without requiring metaphysical assumptions which could
never be tested. Philosophically, I have been a dialectical ma-
terialist for two decades now and I find it a most effective theo-
retical instrument in my intellectual work.

Thus my political and philosophical lines of thought merged
into one.

A REFUGEE from Wall Street —I spent four interesting but
financially unpromising years in the underwriting department at
Goldman Sachs & Company during the late thirties when the
Street was still digging out from under the crash — my “career
history” has since been concerned almost entirely with the min-
ing industry. Freeport Sulphur Company, wtih which I have
been connected since 1939, in addition to being a major source
of the world’s supply of sulphur also has interests in a number
of other important mineral raw materials including nickel, oil,
potash and manganese. At one time or another over the past
eighteen years, I have applied myself to various phases of Free-
port’s interests in all of these materials. As we learned early in
Ec A, the distinguishing characteristic of a mining enterprise is
that it deals with wasting assets. In practice this means that the
major concern of our business is to find new reserves of these ma-
terials, once found to evaluate them and if attractive to develop
them. One way or another, a large part of my working life has
been devoted to such efforts. My present assignment stems from
our discovery several years ago of a major new deposit of potash
in New Mexico. I was given the task of evaluating the commer-
cial possibilities of this discovery. My conclusions were affirma-
tive; I am now in the middle of trying to prove that I was right.
National Potash Company was formed in 1955 as a partnership
venture by Freeport and Pittsburgh Consolidation Coal Com-
pany. In the past three years, we have arranged financing, opened
a mine, built a refinery, established production and sales organi-
zations and are, I hope, fairly launched on our course. Like any
new venture we have lots of problems still to be solved.

We have one son and one daughter; we wish we had more.

Principal hobbies are golf by summer and curling by winter.
The latter, the greatest winter game for our age and up, and more
popular than hockey in Canada, is held back in this country only
by lack of facilities.

Like most suburbanites, my wife and I have been suckers for
volunteer activity on community projects. We feel as though
we had been continuously involved with fund-raising, board
memberships, boy and girl scouts, etc. Two jobs have given me
particular satisfaction. My six years on the school board coin-
cided with a period of extreme growth in our local population.
Our board not only was able to meet the physical problem suc-
cessfully, but by good fortune succeeded in achieving a marked
improvement in the quality of the education offered in our local
schools. With Win Huppuch, I have been for the past six
years a member of the schools and scholarships committee of the
Harvard Club of Westchester. For those who do not know,
these committees are the organizations through which Harvard
Clubs over the country try to help the College by encouraging
the strongest possible candidates to apply for admission, I com-
mend this activity to any member of the Class interested in
strengthening the College. Incidentally, you will get an under-
standing of the difficult problems the Admissions Office has to
face and you will be proud of the high caliber of the applicants
Harvard accepts today.

IN many aspects, I have spent these twenty-five years doing the
opposite of what I brashly but at the time confidently promised
myself in 1933. My living has been made primarily in the tex-
tile business, which I had earlier considered a fate second only
to the WPA. My bride made no pretense of meeting my pre-
scribed requirements for domestic skills. My military career,
instead of on the high seas, was through a technicality in O.D.
in the rear ranks at Camp Lee and later with double bars at an
OQMG desk in sight of the Potomac but with even those dismal
waters barred by the War College fence. Rather than a parcel of
kids (mostly male) while still at an age to cope, we cherish one
lone girl-child so late that she considers us contemporaneous with
her grandparents. Although well along at one time in following
the glib view of the HES student that there were always
boys being trained farther down the Charles to worry about
technical details, in my new connection at Fabric Research Lab-
oratories I find myself outranked and outflanked by products
of M.LT.

The probability is that fate, in these circumstantial matters,
has dealt with me as well as if 1 had been consistent with my
earlier intents. At least I am now satisfied that such circum-
stances are not as important as I once had thought.

Professionally, my career has gone through a sequence of
transitions. Although I started with in-plant production super-
vision with Pepperell in Lewiston, Maine, with only general tech-
nical responsibilities, the miscellany of wartime assignments
moved me over more into involvement with scientific details
and developments. Returning to Maine, but this time with Bates,

[ 1182 }

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

I functioned in staff assignments, concluding as director of re-
search and development. To complete the swing, I am now in
the consulting game, in an independent facility, with a role
that spans previous experiences in industrial management, market-
ing, and research, and which is not limited solely to textile ap-
plications. There is logic to the pattern as it finally turns out,
though it was far from my thoughts that June morning in the
Yard.

My non-professional life has been mostly private, with only
such public ventures as are urged by social and civic conscience.
Perhaps unreasonably, I have avoided being caught up in the ma-
chinery of organized society, particularly those elements where
belonging and going through the motions take precedence over
objectives and accomplishment. Family-type recreation, as or-
ganic gardening, skiing, sailing, climbing, etc., have figured
largely in balancing out our living pattern.

Except for the military interlude, we have so far stayed with-
in the New England scene, although smarter and perhaps wiser
counsel has urged transfer to more burgeoning situations. Per-
haps it is only rationalization, and that the lure of snowy slopes
and secluded anchorages or just plain nostalgia are the actual
factors, but I feel a certain sense of compatibility with what
obscured remnants are left of the New England tradition. Among
these I think principally of: acceptance of the business of life as
necessary and challenging, but conscious denial that it is the
whole of life; insistence that people count for more than things,
loyalty to a code of standards, but within which independent in-
dividuality is not only tolerated but encouraged; awareness of
cultural roots and significance. Insofar as Harvard is custodian
of those traditions, | am grateful to be identified with it when
the count is taken.

WAS graduated from Harvard Law School in 1937. Had various

ositions as attorney before the war with private law firms and
then with the Department of Justice. I spent most of my four
years in the Army as a crytanalyst. The work was intense but
interesting. After being commissioned, the Army seemed a
much more pleasant institution. The last part of my service was
with the Strategic Bombing Survey’s postwar examination of
Japan. I wrote the economic intelligence report, an evaluation
of the economic and intelligence estimates made during the war
by the various United States Intelligence Services. Major con-
clusions: we overestimated Japanese economic potential. Chief
reasons: compartmentalization and lack of communication be-
tween the various American intelligence groups each of which
was mainly concerned with a particular phase of Japan’s economy,
overemphasis on economic aspects of problems with neglect of
psychological, social and political factors.

Following the war I worked as an attorney for several govern-
ment housing agencies. In 1948 I joined the legal staff of the
Civil Aeronautics Board and am still with this agency. My work
has been concerned with economic proceedings before the Board,
chiefly routes and rates. At present, I am chief of the Legal Staff
of the Routes Division.

I married Naomi Kaplan in 1944. Our two boys, nine and seven

occupaTIon: Director of research, advertising agency.

MEMBER OF: Rocky Point Club, Old Greenwich.

TWO years in Wall Street at the bottom of The Depression can
do a lot to a man’s sensibilities. So, in 1935, I became a charter
member in the opening of a new advertising agency, Arthur
Kudner, Inc. (Today Kudner Agency serves a host of long-
established clients in American industry including General Mo-
tors, National Distillers, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Com-
pany, General Telephone, Pan American Airways and others.)
I made the shift to advertising and the then relatively new field
of market research. I knew little about research, less about agen-
cies. But from what I had heard, advertising offered glamour —
if nothing else. As it turned out at the time, the agency business
offered little glamour, less money and a lot more of virtually
everything else (“everything else” being, in pure distillate, “hard
work”). Today I am still at this fascinating job, the main changes
over the twenty-three-year span being that I am now head of
research for Kudner, pay my bills somewhat more promptly and
comb a bit less hair than in those Depression Days.

But there was an interim period experienced by most of us.
In the fall of 1940 I was called up — found myself an ensign
aboard a battleship. Little time for research here! After Pearl
Harbor, on to Scotland as prospective executive officer of a
British-built Corvette, ours through “lend-lease-in-reverse.” A
year later I became C.O., convoying ships from Trinidad to Re-
cife, Brazil. Next came the command of destroyer escorts in the
North Atlantic and the Mediterranean, I had just commu:
sioned a destroyer-transport at Hingham when V-J Day rolled

around, Six months later I was back in civvies and back at
Kudner.

Then, living in Old Greenwich with my wife, Adele, I found
myself in P.T.A., working with the First Congregational Church
and aiding various scouting activities. Toss in, along with this,
sailing, race committee work and golf, and you pretty much have
the leisure hour picture.

My only offspring is a junior at Berkshire School and hopes to
go to Harvard. As the headmaster put it: “Set your sights real

high, didn’t you, son? It’s not as easy to get in there now as it
Bn you, son: y tog

THIS Report comes at a most inopportune time for a clear,
businesslike statement of my activities. 1 am right in the middle
of the process of resigning my position and moving the whole
household to a ranch in Arizona. 1 am thus rightfully’ not a
business executive nor yet a rancher, and I dislike to use the word
“itinerant.”

Having entered Northwestern University Law School after
my junior year at Harvard, I am not the proud possessor of a
Harvard degree. However, I did manage to get through law
school and be admitted to the practice of law in Illinois, which
I pursued until the war. During the war I worked for the Ord-
nance Department in numerous capacities, winding up by rene-
gotiating the profits of manufacturers to whom I had let contracts
some years before. Having enjoyed the contacts and activities
away from the Courts of Justice, it was with reluctance that
I returned to practise law for several years. However, my in-
terest being elsewhere, I was happy to become the secretary and

general handyman of W. H. Hutchinson & Son, Inc., a manu-
facturer of bottle caps, and have been with them since rg4y.

Last summer I had an opportunity to buy a small ranch in
Arizona and, since I had vacationed in this state for a number of
years, I seized the opportunity and within two wecks of this
writing will have resigned my position and be in the process of
moving my family to the West for what we hope will be an ac-
tive participation in the growth of western communities.

Outside of business, my activities, particularly in the last few
years, have been involved with my family in endeavoring to help
a bit in the growing-up process of four children. Our life being
mainly a family one, I have not participated to a great extent in
political, community or club activities. Of course, I have pulled
my oar on such doings, but I am not a dedicated organization
man.

It just occurs to me that someone reading this might think I
had crawled into a shell and retired. Nothing could be further
from the truth. I am looking forward to an active ranch life,
coupled with other business activities in southern Arizona, and
trust my children will join in such activities as they attain the
ages to do so.

[ 1189 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

my aspirations in 1933, 1 am pleased to find that every one has
been achieved or surpassed. What do I do now?

My main interest is, of course, my family. Activities run from
teaching the oldest to drive a car to tying the youngest’s shoe-
laces. Four months ago we decided we’d had enough of New
England’s winters and moved lock, stock and barrel to California.
Naturally we're all busy making new friends, which seems to be
easier here. Or are we more experienced? We're really enjoy-
ing the delights of learning new hobbies and visiting new places
together as a family and in groups with new friends.

With my training in astronomy and law, I am frequently
asked how I happened to become a microwave engineer. This
is something that happened gradually so that I don’t really know
the whole answer. During World War II I got interested in
radar, and subsequently decided that I liked microwaves, a
brand new field. It is a pleasure now to be working in a field
that would be a hobby anyway.

Speaking of hobbies, I have many, too many. But though I
don’t devote full time to any one activity, I always have some-
thing to look forward to, a very pleasant feeling. I play bridge
and chess often, tennis when the weather is fair. I still dabble in

magic, but to my wife’s chagrin, I don’t like gardening. Also, the
big California way-of-life, backyard barbecues, leaves me cold.
Why spend money for a modern, push-button stove and then cook
in a primitive fashion? Women like it because it puts the burden
of preparing supper on the husband. This burden I gladly
shoulder occasionally, but in my modern stove. If this sounds
like a gripe, it really isn’t, because the California way-of-life I
find very relaxing and peaceful.

Politically, ’m an independent who hopes that someday this
country will have a good, strong president again. We haven't had
one for twenty years and I don’t see any on the immediate horizon.
I have voted for Republicans and Democrats and would vote for
the Vegetarian Party if they'd put up a capable man.

All in all, the past twenty-five years have been happy ones. In
my own field, I have managed to leave a little footprint on the
sands of time. My family life has been extremely happy. It is

perhaps inevitable that people living together should love each
other. We do more; we like each other.

IN the winter of 1937-38, after a year and a half of graduate study
in anthropology and four seasons of archeological field work in
the Southwest, I joined my brother— who was then making a
slow recovery from a series of illnesses that began in his last year
in college — in operating the family farm in northern Ohio. For
years I had coped with an indomitable beimeweh. But in settling
on our ancestral acres and thereby dealing with one psychological
problem, I acquired a disabling sense of guilt. I had turned down
the offer of a fellowship at Harvard, I was blighting my parents’
hopes of a professional career for me; I was attempting to do some-
thing to which I brought only Tolstoyan love of the land. Despite
a persistent lack of capital, a none-too-robust physique and a
limited knowledge of the complexities of modern agriculture, I
stuck to farming in Ohio and in Michigan (at my father-in-law’s
place) for ten years. Again and again I felt the harassments of
poverty, frustrations, bone-weariness, isolation. I missed, non-
deliberately, active participation in World War II. Yet in these

[ 1192 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

years I gained a devoted and resourceful wife and two handsome
and sturdy daughters.

Early in the winter of 1946-47, I received a copy of J. O. Brew’s
report of “Archeological investigations on Alkali Ridge in south-
eastern Utah,” just published by the Peabody Museum of Harvard.
I had once analyzed, in a research course, some of the material
described therein. But it was the intellectual cogency and vitality
of this large volume that impressed me and bestirred me to in-

uire of the author, as an old friend and as a master of the trade,
if he thought there was any chance of my getting back, after
nearly a decade of rusticating, into the professional swim. Brew
replied at once, affirmatively. It seems a vast federal archeological
salvage program was just getting under way in riverine arcas
throughout the United States that were being flooded, or would
be inundated in the near future, by multiple-purpose dams. Fle
thought that my recent experience with the soil and its tillers
would make me particularly fitted for looking into back-countries
which had never seen or heard of archeologists. On his advice |
corresponded with Dr. Frank Roberts, of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, who was (and continues to be) the director of the River
Basin Surveys, which was set up to carry out the archeological
and paleontological salvage work in cooperation with the National
Park Service and with the federal construction agencies, the Bu-
reau of Reclamation and the Corps of Engineers. I was encour-
aged sufficiently so that I gave up farming in 1947-48, returned to
Harvard for some refresher work — notably a seminar on Central
and Northern Plains archeology, with Brew — and waited for an
opening. Starting in mid-August, 1948, on a temporary Civil
Service appointment under Roberts, I examined some small rescr-
voir areas in North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois. In mid-
May, 1949, I was transferred to the Missouri Basin Project of the
River Basin Surveys, with headquarters in Lincoln. In the fall of
that year I moved my family to Lincoln and here we have lived
steadily, though precariously, ever since. My archeological ficld
work has been done in twenty-five small and large reservoir arcas
in five Plains states. I have supervised the mechanical and hand
excavation of thirty-five sites of Indian provenience covering ap-
proximately ten thousand years of time, according to radioc arben
and other dating methods. Within the next year, if all goes well,

[ 1193 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

I shall have completed the manuscripts for ten monographs or
consequential articles based directly, or indirectly, on my field
and library researches in Plains archeology and ethnology.

In 1952, I had a major operation —a laminectomy and the re-
moval of a ruptured intervertebral disk— which ended several
years of painful back-aches and last year I was cured of a duodenal
ulcer. I am now in good shape save for dimming eyesight, failing
dentition and gradual senescence. My wife is the spry secretary
of the University of Nebraska physics department. Our two chil-
dren, who have refreshingly different’ personalities, amaze us by
their daily, saltatory, mental and physical development. |

Politically and socially speaking, we are often driven to despair
in the midst of this great Bible Belt, whose fixed political inlook
and rigid mores we found to be only slightly mitigated in local
Unitarianism, we are increasingly perturbed by the incompetence
and hypocrisy of the Eisenhower regime (or regency) and by the
declining quality of cultural values and we are plumb scared by
the nationalistic frenzies rampant in our shrinking world as docu-
mented relentlessly in The New Republic and The Reporter. If
Lucy and I weren’t so pre-occupied with our diurnal rounds and
with trying to figure out how to put our elder daughter into a
good college next year on ever-dwindling real incomes, we'd be
very blue indeed.

MEMBER OF: Neighborhood Club of Quincy; Harvard Club of Quincy.

AFTER an apprenticeship in merchandising with the General
Electric Supply Corporation in Boston, I became engaged in the
phonograph record business where I was affliated with RCA
Victor and MGM in sales and management positions.

The advent of television created an interesting new sales ficld

and I became associated with the Sylvania Electric Company, first

as salesman for the local Boston distributor and subsequently as
district sales manager for the Radio and Television Division op-
erating out of St. Louis. In this capacity, I traveled the old “Show-
boat” circuit from St. Louis to New Orleans which I thoroughly
enjoyed. However, the lure of that wonderfully different New
England climate brought me back to Boston as sales manager for
the local Sylvania distributor.

I remained in the television field until about a year ago at which
time I decided that a change would be beneficial. Discount opera-
tors having taken over completely, a legitimate merchandising
program became impossible and whatever interest I had in the
business was lost. Being single, a decision to quit was not too
difficult to make. After a much needed summer vacation, I joined
forces with the Suburban Guide and Directory, a young and in-
teresting group that publishes the local Red Books. I am happily

engaged in sales and research and glad to be far removed froin the
television scene.

During World War II, I was a staff officer in Communications
aboard the flagship of the Commander-in-chief, Atlantic Fleet.

THIRTY-EIGHT years ago I read my father’s biography in the
Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Report of the Class of 1895 and recall
marvelling that one so old could seem outwardly so well pre-
served. Now it is our turn to lay the facts on the line.

Perusal of similar books over the years indicates that to be
really respectable one should list membership on the board of

[ 1196 |

i

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

directors of at least one lying-in hospital, two charitable organiza-
tions, one savings bank, a small cordage company, and an art
museum, if possible. I advance none of these. As my family
statistics indicate, I have for the past few years been livi ring in a
lying-in hospital; but I would not deceive anyone with the notion
that I direct it.

My years at Harvard made a tremendous dent upon me; and the
interests I acquired there are still active aspects of my pattern
of life. As an undergraduate I became a rabid Crimson writer, an
amateur musician via the glee club and choir, an impresario for
foreign students, a layman in science, a microbe hopeful of a
peaceful world, to be immediately achieved by lowering the price
of Boston Foreign Policy Association lunches to within the range
of the average Harvard student.

Immediately following college I spent a year at Cambridge
University, and then plunged into the Law School, whence I
emerged in 1938, bloodied and myopic, but strengthened in my
ability to argue any side of any question unsuccessfully but well.
I was admitted to the bar in Massachusetts and the District of
Columbia, and during the years prior to Army service worked ina
small lobbying firm in Washington, D.C., and in the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

The most interesting phase of my military service was the last
couple of years, spent in the patent law section of the Manhattan
Project, where I acquired a layman’s perspective of the atomic
bomb. The opportunity presented to a person with legal training,
a dash of writing ability, and a smattering of ignorance of things
scientific appeared an inviting one. I have continued along these
lines since.

Effective administration of the vast military research and de-
velopment program is vital to us all. I have enjoyed contributing
my submicroscopic part. It is chilling to ponder the comment of
one outstanding nuclear physicist, that the outcome of the cold
war may well depend upon whether the next Lord Rutherford is
born on this side of the Iron Curtain, or beyond it. This problem,
on which many of the Class have obviously been working, is on
the lap of the gods. Meanwhile it behooves us as a nation to mavi-
mize the use and effectiveness of all the scientific resources we
possess and they are considerable.

[1197 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

Interesting assignments have fallen my way since Manhattan
District days. I served as assistant technical historian of Operation
Crossroads — the first postwar atomic bomb tests in Bikini. |
spent five years as legal adviser to the Research and Development
Board, a Department of Defense agency charged with review of
the over-all military research and development program.

Of these years [ recall various incidents—the drama in a
Congressional hearing room when the author of the “anonymous
document” castigating the Air Force’s B-36 was identified as the
right hand man of the Navy’s Under Secretary for Air; various
occasions when I served as official greeter and interpreter for

foreign scientists and military people who visited us; an interesting
meeting in London as a member of a U.S.-U.K, committee; a
successful gambit in which I aided in annihilating a dubious re-
search proposal involving several million dollars; and so on.

In 1952 I came to Durham, North Carolina, where the Ordnance
Corps of the Army had just set up its Office of Ordnance Re-
search, administrative office for a $7,000,000 program of sponsored
research, more than half of which is in basic research projects at
universities throughout the country. We are, in effect, a research
foundation. My function deals with all manner of general prob-
lems, including the preparation of a monthly research bulletin,
periodic reports of our entire operation, regulatory questions, and
the like. At the moment I am working on the planning of an
Army motion picture on basic research. Do not watch for it at
your neighborhood theatre.

Avocationally I do free-lance newspaper writing, serving as
music critic of the Durham Morning Herald, for which I also write
editorials, occasional features, and a Sunday record review
column. Duke University, scene of many of the concerts I review,
has the motto Eruditio et Religio, which cannot match Veritas,
but which does account for the fact that along the way Old
Turks at Duke have sought to have me fired. Thus far the final
scores of these encounters, by virtue of the executive editor’s trust,
has consistently been: Harvard 1, Duke o.

A small community with little congestion and three neighbor-
ing universities is an admirable locus for life in this era. By and
large we have most of the fine advantages and none of the dis-
advantages of academic life. My wife, a truly fine musician, is on

AFTER having the foresight to graduate in 1933—a year of
opportunity! —I held various jobs mostly connected with the
food industry until 1943, when I took time out for three years’
duty with the U.S. Navy as a gunnery officer in the U.S.N. Armed
Guard, a very restful three years at sea (i.e. between alerts and
watches). It was a very cheap way to travel to many points of
interest.

I returned to the S.S. Pierce Company at the beginning of 1946
taking over new duties as manager of warehousing and transporta-
tion with that firm. I left S.S. Pierce Company and Boston in
December, 1945, to assume my present job as director of ware-
housing for the Liberal Markets Inc. in Dayton, Ohio. Although
I didn’t listen to Horace Greeley’s heralded advice to the young
man of his day until I was above the age limit, I really like the
Midwest in almost every respect. The main things I miss are my
folks in Boston and the good old Atlantic Ocean for the summer.
We still take our vacations up in New England so that we get the
seashore benefits for a couple of weeks a year anyway.

Iam very fortunate in having married a wonderful girl and with

Mary and our four children have had wonderful blessings from

dispute procedure and how to handle grievances without holding
them all for the arbitrator at the family dinner table in the evening.
Having been brought up in a rather large family (with my father
and mother and eight brothers and sisters at the family dinner
table), I find today that the greatest pleasure in life is listening to
the bubbling enthusiastic ideas of my four children. Aside from
calling me “fat old daddy” and thinking their mother and I be-
long to the Victorian era, they do occasionally try to humor us
old folks by bringing us up to date on their jet-propelled era.
Well, Pl hope to be seeing many old friends in June and catch
up on their lives and experiences at our Twenty-fifth.

I left Washington in August, 1942, as lieutenant (j.g.), Supply

Honolulu until the end of the war. I served in Aomori and
Yokosuka, Japan, for six months before being discharged as a

I went back to Rockbestos for two years, took a sabbatical
year (doing nothing), and spent a year in real estate. In July,
1950, I volunteered to return to the Supply Corps and again spent
two years in Mechanicsburg, then a year in Chicago in contract
termination and property disposal work. In 1954, w vhen the Navy
decided again that they didn’t need the help of the Reserves, I
was released to inactive duty. Being born and bred a New

to go the rest of the way to California where I have been ever

itself, the Harvard Veritas Committee. My daughter Julie, now a

OCCUPATION: Treasurer, Natick Federal Savings and Loan Association,

MEMBER OF: Boston Chapter, Society of Savings and Loan Controllers,

SINCE leaving Harvard, and my stay there was all too brief, my
life has been made up of a lot of little things. Little in the way of
noteworthy acclaim perhaps, but mighty big and important to me
and to those I hold dear.

For me, life began to hold its first real meaning when I was
married on June 27, 1936, to Grace L. Welch. With the arrival
on October 2, 1938, of a son, Joseph T., 3d, my life became even
more complete and on September 26, 1941, with the birth of a
daughter, Janice, my blessings were threefold. Our son is now a
sophomore at Colgate University; where he is a varsity football
player. Our daughter is a junior at Natick High School and is
hopeful of going to college. |

For the past twenty years my interests have centered around
my family, of whom I am most proud, my work and my church.
I have taken an active interest in the civic and political life of our
community because | firmly believe that, if we are to maintain
American Freedom in its true sense, then we must all live and work
at it throughout our daily lives.

In 1939 I left Telechron, where I had worked for five years, and
became a teller at the Natick Federal Savings and Loan Associa-
tion. With the passage of time I have progressed to the office of
treasurer for Natick Federal.

IT seems inconceivable, at least to me, how the unrelated activities
in which I have engaged since graduation have blended into a
pattern which has made possible the work in which I am now
engaged, the direction of a research and development project at
Eastman Kodak in systems and methods for a fascinating new.
group of electronic data-processing equipment which we are
building. |

After graduation from the Business School I was an importer
of Scotch and English wool yarn and tweeds; during World
War ILI built ships for the Navy; afterwards I sold and installed
punched card accounting machines with IBM; during Korea I
was engaged in highly precise ordnance work; after that I helped
develop and market new components for furniture manufacturing
— business career in which the beginnings and endings of hos-
tilities have supplied the punctuation marks —- periods.

These activities centered around Boston and my home town,
Gardner, Massachusetts. While in Gardner, at one time or another
I served two terms on the City Council, broadcast play-by-play
descriptions of high school football games over the local radio,
was active in church and local projects. Moving our home to
Rochester meant pulling up a lifetime of New England roots and
seemed like quite a step at the time — it still does; but the trans-
planting was successful and the tree seems to have flourished in
its new environment. We like it here, and I am very happy to be
a factor in the development program of an outstanding company
and in such a fantastically rapidly growing field. .

Through no effort of mine our family has grown in numbers
as well as stature. As tabulated above, John, our oldest, after
graduating from Colby and O.CS. at the Coast Guard Academy,
has taken unto himself a lovely wife and together they have given
us our first grandchild. Tom has graduated from Bowdoin and
is doing graduate work in chemistry at M.1.T.; Deane is a junior

at Bowdoin and Priscilla a junior at Skidmore. Our sixth-grader,
Connie, has forced our attention from the complexitics of the late
teens to the babel of the pre-teens. Only one of them at home
now, but that doesn’t mean many dull moments.

They tell me that since last reporting, my hair is even thinner,
but I can’t see it up front yet, so ignore the whole thing, they
also tell me my middle is a little thicker, but I can still see the tips
of my toes without bending. Other parts of me are probably
deteriorating as Time wreaks its vengeance, but nothing has given
out yet— completely. Hobbies—none; outside activities —
none; clubs — none. I have done more traveling these past years
than I would have preferred, so home and fireside still seem pretty
welcome and cozy. I relax by puttering around, not by pursuing,
it works out.

We are all looking forward to June and Reunion, where we
hope to renew many old acquaintances, Untilthen....

REFLECTING on the quarter of a century and more, since I left
Cambridge for a life of pioneering in Israel, 1 am not sure that my
story, so different from the “normal career” of Harvard-men of
my generation, would be of sufficient interest to make it lengthy.
For the record, however, here are some landmarks.

When I left College during my junior year, it was primarily be-
cause of financial reasons, and with the intention to return as soon
as I could raise sufficient funds for tuition. However, it wasn’t so
simple during the depression years, and I never came back. In 1933
I was already on my new path as a Halutz-pioneer settler. To-
gether with other Zionist-youths idealists, my wife and I set out
to build a new society in the ancient homeland of the Jewish
people. Here we established the first American Kibbutz (coopera-
tive colony) named in honor of our great friend and teacher,
Justice Louis B. Brandeis —Ein Hashofet (Shofet in Hebrew
means Judge).

I began as an agricultural worker in the orange groves of
Hadera, seriously considering a career as a citriculturist. But that
only lasted a few years. Other duties and public tasks took me
away from agriculture back into public affairs, political activities
and education, not always in accordance with my own desires and
plans, for ever since my first days at Harvard, and even before, I

dreamt of a literary career. In 1939, I reluctantly agreed to go on
an educational tour to America for Hashomer Hatzair and the

[ 1208 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

Jewish National Fund. The plan was for two years, but the war
made it impossible to return until after V-Day.

It was immediately upon my arrival in the U.S. that I had the
great privilege of reporting the progress of our endeavors to
Justice Brandeis at his summer home in Chatham, I continued to
be in touch with him by correspondence until his death. Those
were crowded, hectic years of tireless work, but not without
accomplishments. My work carried me from east to west and into
Canada, lecturing, directing educational activities and writing
occasionally. Once or twice, while in Boston, I also had a chance
to visit Harvard, but found very few of my classmates (except my
old freshman-roommate Harold Shore—then stationed in Boston),

Back at Ein Hashofet after the war, I again attempted a return
to agriculture, but the tasks of pioneering and rehabilitation of
war-scarred youth, again drew me away from what I would have
liked to do most. First, with Youth Aliyah, and later as a teacher
of humanities in our district Secondary School, I am again an
educator, for the past twelve years. Only during summer vaca-
tions I occasionally take time out to write.

Our daily life is too busy, leaving little time for reflections or
recollections. College life in those distant days of the thirtics
seems so far away; and only our daily contact with teenagers of
this generation often reminds me of campus joys and worrics.
Otherwise, I have little cause to complain. In many respects, ours
is a relatively happy life, even in this age of wars and hatred,
for we saw with our own eyes the realization of a great vision —
the re-establishment of the state of Israel, and participated in the
renascence of a nation. _

Our three children are developing normally and enjoy a happy
childhood and youth under most ideal circumstances. Our oldest
son, Noam, is already back home after his regular service in the
Israeli army — shows some talent as a painter and a passionate
love of archeology. Yigal, aged thirteen, is more apt with the pen
than with a brush, and is generally a bright student, while our
youngest, Ada, aged eleven, shows signs of artistic ability in music
as well as in the plastic arts.

So, you can see, we accomplished much of what we wished
for, when we went to Israel. Today, Ein Hashofet after twenty
years on the map, is a thriving communal settlement, of 600

[ 1209 ]

souls; both a home for its members and a training place for many
who came here to live and to build, from all corners of the
Jewish dispersion. And, although I am not in a position to con-
tribute to the Alumni Fund, as 1 probably would have if I were
established in the U.S., I feel that my life in Israel has been one
of fulfilment, so that “I scorn to change my state with kings.”
(Shakespeare’s sonnet-29) Should anyone of 33 come out here by

chance, Fin Hashofet is just about forty minutes by car from
downtown Haifa. It is a standing invitation!

however, a pleasant one. Most of my time is consumed by job and

family. The latter, consisting of four youngsters ranging from
eleven down to three years, with another scheduled to arrive this

THE past twenty-five years have been crowded full of activity
and experiences, some unforgettable, but for the most part, the
period has been successful in making the most of the talents
given me.

The first five years following graduation were spent in the
Harvard Graduate Schools of Design and Engineering studying
city planning and street traffic. These were stimulating years
except for the summers which were spent in hospitals while
doctors chipped infected bone out of my hips, For the degree
of Master in City Planning, I designed a model town with built-in
traffic safety features to lessen the hazards of living in the auto-
motive age. As a result, I received the Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship
for research in traffic engineering. The next three years were
spent at Yale instructing and doing further research in urban
traffic and transportation planning and engineering. These too
were rewarding years. |

In 1941, a group of civic leaders from Providence, Rhode
Island, came to Yale seeking answers to their city’s traffic prob-
lems. Among the suggestions was the establishment of a Civic

working hours, form share-the-ride clubs, organize preventive
motor vehicle maintenance programs, dimout, brownout, blackout
the city and carry out a host of other “Win the War” schemes
conjured up by the “Commandos of Main Street.” I not only
lived and dreamt Civil Defense, I had nightmares about winning
the war with the forces behind the forces at the front. I tried to
get away by writing to every branch of the service, and every
time I got a letter from some branch asking me to drop by for a
physical, I would jump with joy, and hope. Finally, I got a letter
from Washington, saying, in effect, we don’t want you for
general service, we don’t want you for limited service, we don't
want you. So, I joined the Providence Players and, due to the
shortage of eligible leading men, did my bit in such patriotic hits
as “Ring Around Elizabeth,” “There’s Always Juliet,” etc.

Toward the end of the war, I was invited to lecture at Columbia
on planning for the postwar era. While in New York, I stopped
by the American Transit Association to inquire what the strect
railway companies planned doing with their street cars when the
automotive manufacturers started churning out millions of cars
and thousands of buses, and roadbuilders began unrolling carpets
of new roadways all over the suburbs, and families started to fice
the congested cities. They said, “You tell us.” Thus ended my
““war’’ career.

The next five years from 1945 to 1950 were spent commuting
all over the country, devising palliative and remedial measures
for expediting the movements of people and goods over horse’n’-
buggy streets corroded with curbed cars, from Portland, Maine,
to Portland, Oregon.

Traffic conditions became so acute in the New York metro-
politan area, that the Auto Club of New York asked me to spend
full time providing a sustained traffic advisory service, at their
expense, to communities throughout the New York region. T his I
did, until frantic calls kept coming from Philadelphia for help in
organizing that city’s traffic, which was crippling i Its commerce.

[ 1215 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1033

In June of 1952, I went to Philadelphia, reorganized the ad-
ministrative machinery for handling traffic, instituted major
changes in traffic flow and direction and by the end of 1952,
Philadelphia enjoyed the lowest pedestrian traffic deaths in
twenty-five years and led the large cities of the nation in traffic
management. For this service, 1 was rewarded in 1953 in the most
unforgettable manner.

By now, we were living in the American Kingdom of the
Automobile, immortalized by Picasso, in a bronze Autapia. Our
cities had figuratively exploded. Fundamental requirement num-
ber one was the need for coordination in planning the recon-
version and redevelopment of our cities to fit the motor age. So
I formed Coordinated Planning Services, consisting of a team of
specialists in various phases of metropolitan planning to apply the
overall approach to specific civic problems.

And here we are, looking forward, forecasting probable trends
of future metropolitan development and trying to plan the most
desirable physical pattern for tomorrow, with little desire to look
back except to gain experience from the past.

THE years have gone by quickly! After graduating I worked
for my father from 1933 to 1938 in the Massachusetts Electric
Manufacturing Company, a small wire mill in Lynn, Massachu-
setts. You may remember these were the depression years and it
was decided that we could not fight the competition and our
business folded. For the next four years | worked for the Pratt-

Whitney Aircraft Company in East Hartford, Connecticut.
During this period I was married and lived in Manchester, Con-
necticut. In 1942 I had to resign from Pratt-Whitney Aircraft
and decided to return to western Massachusetts, where we settled
in Williamsburg, a pleasant village in the “foothills” of the Berk-
shires.

Although I had been in the Naval Reserve for eight years, 1
received a discharge in 1942 because my eyes were not up to
standards. For a short period I worked for the Cardanic Cor-
poration, which was formed to produce the Norden bombsight
for the Army; however, this company folded up in 1943 and I
then went with the Pro-Phylactic Brush Company, a division of
Warner-Lambert, in Florence, Massachusetts, This firm manu-
factures combs, hairbrushes, tooth brushes and custom molded
plastic parts. Our life in Williamsburg is pleasantly quiet —
although these are the “crowded” years in bringing up a family
of three boys and one girl whose ages vary from eighteen years
down to four years.

IMMEDIATELY after graduation, 1 became a Westerner; ever
since, I have come east of the Rockies only with reluctance. My
first job took me across most of the Far West, doing precise level
work for the Coast and Geodetic Survey. For two years I was
able to explore and live with many of our country’s supreme land-
scapes. Those two years, 1934 and 1935, were the formative years
of my life, it now appears.

After leaving the Survey when the funds ran out, I did a hitch
in the Advertising and Sales Department of the Telechron Com-
pany in Ashland, Massachusetts. Then a chance at a two-year

contract in South America with a geophysical-prospecting crew
uprooted me very easily from my desk in 1939, and I spent an
exciting time in the jungles of Colombia, with holidays i in Bogota
and Barranquilla. 1 came home from the tropics just in time to
go to war. .

I was in the army uniform by April, 1941; after a year in the
Medical Department I was commissioned with the Fourth O.C. S.
Class of the Engineer School at Ft. Belvoir. Until September,
1943, I stayed on as a Ft. Belvoir faculty member, leaving to join
the 206th Engineer Combat Battalion enroute to England. After
a relatively pleasant nine months of fog, black-out and tea-drink-
ing, our battalion went into Normandy with V Corps, I being
a battalion executive by this time. Presently we took off with
Patton in the breakthrough and remained with Third Army (XX
Corps) all the way to Austria and V-E day. I finished the war as

{ 1218 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

a lieutenant colonel of Engineers and am still active in the Army
Reserve.

The spring of 1946 found me completely at loose ends, with
only a guiding instinct to go West. I tried graduate work at the
University of Arizona first, and while there was inveigled into
taking a job teaching freshman English. Two years of this was
enough — but meanwhile I had stumbled into summertime work
at Grand Canyon National Park for the National Park Service,
the outfit which now, ten years later, is still writing my pay
checks. Here at Grand Canyon I met my wife in the summer
of 1946.

Park work was seasonal for me for several years while I at-
tempted to make a living from the ski business at Flagstaff, Ari-
zona. Those winters on the San Francisco Peaks were wonderful
fun, and rewarding in almost every way — except financially. Fi-
nally I gave up looking for the snow that seldom came, and moved
to Santa Fe, New Mexico, into a permanent position with the
National Park Service. Since then we have moved twice again —
Park families are a vagrant lot — to arrive at Fort Union National
Monument, where I am superintendent.

Having recently been decorated with a ten-year Department of
the Interior button, I suppose I am a career civil servant. The
Park Service career seems to have agreed with me: the work is
always varied, sufficiently challenging and I have the good for-
tune to be surrounded by co-workers whom I enjoy and respect.
We of the Parks are of course primarily concerned with conser-
vation — and I find this is a most satisfying concern. The Fort
Union job is particularly interesting in that this is a new National

Monument requiring in the beginning stages quite a scope of cre-
ative effort. For the past year I have been wrapped up in his-
torical research and museum planning — with time out for skiing,
hunting, fishing and camping in the lovely northern New Mexico
forests.
In years to come the Wings expect to live and work in other
National Parks of the West. We can think of no more pleasant
future.

HOW does one record and appraise twenty-five years of his life,
especially that most active period between graduation and
Twenty-fifth Reunion? Previous Class letters recounted the growth
of my business career, military experiences during World War
II and community activities — almost endless in number. There is
not much point in repeating them now —I have been busy! So
has my good wife, and we seem to thrive on a continuous go-
around of civic affairs and social excitement. This will all probably
continue for some years to come. However, a new period of life
is at hand for us — all the birds have flown from the nest, and we

leading to physical therapist, while reveling in romance and dis-
secting frog muscles in zoo lab.

It’s a wonderful life! Looking back, though, I am convinced
that my greatest satisfaction comes not from a modest financial
success, nor from the enjoyment I derived from working for
others, and not from the pleasures of good living, but from the
deep happiness that glows whenever I contemplate the three fine
girls with whom Kitty and I have been privileged to share family
living.

Twenty-five years out of college is a good time to look at
yourself and around you. I am glad I had to write this report,
otherwise I might not have taken the time for such a look. I
expect to have a grand time next June, as I do at all partics
(planning parties is my chief hobby); and I hope you can all be

IT is at times such as these, when one is obliged to recall the
past quarter-century, that he realizes how very fortunate and
privileged he really is. Aside from five and a half years in the
Army during World War II, 1 have been able to follow the pro-
fession I chose, and to live in relative comfort with a perfect wife
(Radcliffe ’36) and two interesting small boys. All this seemed
most remote in those rather bleak depression days into which
we were all thrust in 1933, armed only with those distinguished
diplomas — the last to be signed by President Lowell.

[ 1222 ]

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

My work at Toledo with its active Museum of Art has con-
tinued to grow in responsibility and interest since I first came
here in 1946, following discharge from the Army and OSS.
During this past decade the Museum’s collections have grown
considerably, and search for works of art has taken me on re-
peated trips to most European capitals. This aspect of my work
has been the most challenging and interesting. Almost as stim-
ulating has been organizational work on some of the large inter-
national exhibitions we have been able to bring to Toledo, such
as: paintings from Berlin Museums; art treasures from Vienna,
Dutch painting of the Golden Age; and masterpieces of British
painting. During these years the Museum’s staff has grown con-
siderably, and the annual search for personnel has frequently led
me to Harvard’s Fogg Museum where John Coolidge, its direc-
tor, has generously helped to supply many successful additions
to our staff. These trips have made possible a continuing ue with
Harvard, for which I am grateful.

Our life is otherwise simple, sometimes hectic (as with all young
families), but always satisfying. I have no illusions that it will
ever be possible to convince all the citizens of this middle-size
industrial community of the real worth of art. I am greatly con-
cerned, as we all are, with the kind of future which we will be-
queath to our children, feel that we are all too preoccupied with
our material successes, fear that most of us lose sight of spiritual
values. But, of one thing I am sure: an opportunity for educa-
tion, as free and broad as possible, is the only reasonable legacy

we can leave those who will follow us.

MEMBER OF: Massachusetts Medical Society; American College of Physicians;

IN those dark days of Commencement I was one of the more
fortunate graduates in knowing just what I was going to do at
least for the next four or more years, I had been accepted at
Tufts Medical School. Upon graduation in 1937, I embarked
on four years of training in internal medicine at various hos-
pitals. In 1951, I felt that it was time that I left the security and
ecstatic sensation of medical omniscience that one has in the con-
fines of a hospital as an intern and resident.

Before engaging in private practice I decided to complete the
then required year of military training due to the imminent war
clouds. The Army, Navy and USPH: thought otherwise — the
half inch that I was lacking for minimum height requirements
proved too great a barrier for acceptance. Thereupon I entered
private practice in internal medicine in Worcester, Massachusetts.
I must confess that I only pretended practising for my true love
at that time kept me traveling back and forth between Worcester
and Boston.

Came Pearl Harbor and suddenly I had grown in stature — not
enough yet to be accepted as an officer in the medical branch
which was usual for M.D.’s — but as a private about to be drafted.
After a good deal of chasing about, I was finally able to convince
the Army that there was little lacking in that half-inch deficit to
militate against my medical acumen, and I was duly sworn in as
a first lieutenant. (And I might say that I remained such for an
extremely extended period of time unlike my colleagues —as I
become a “lost” unit for four enlisted men and two nurses in a
hospital ship platoon in the sands of Egypt supposedly evacuating
the injured. It was not until an Inspector General literally got
sand in his eye requiring medical care that he became aware of m
situation and my two bars followed.) To get back — before I
embarked on active duty, Florence insisted on starting her own
battles first so with a sudden marriage and short honeymoon I
bid my adieus and joined the great campaign.

After four years in the service —Egypt, Palestine, Africa,
France, Germany and Austria — obtaining five battle stars and
commendation plaque after landing on “Omaha Beach” off France
D plus 2 day, I returned home. (It was fortunate that V-J Day

[ 1224]

occurred when it did for apparently my round the world “tour”
was not going to be considered complete without a sojourn in
Japan.)

Following a refresher medical course at Harvard Medical
School I was swept up by the enthusiastic trend towards service

with the Veterans Administration and became Chief of Medicine
ata VA hospital in Lake City, Florida. Being a true Bostonian
the transition was beyond endurance and I returned to Boston
after eighteen months. In 1956 I went on part-time duty with the
VA and in addition to private practice I joined the Gray Phar-
maceutical Company as associate medical director — to sce what
I could contribute towards tranquilizing our restless population
and stock market.

TO summarize the past twenty-five years, I am extremely grate-
ful for a wonderful family and an understanding and inspiring
wife, good health, many friends, an interesting and absorbing
occupation and various outside interests.

After graduation, five years were spent in the commercial
banking business with the First National Bank of Boston. In
1938, my field of endeavor was changed to that of a professional
trustee offering investment and fiduciary services. In addition,
in 1950, I became associated with Consolidated Investment Trust,
a closed-end mutual fund.

Commissioned in the naval intelligence service in World War
Il, my four years in uniform were rather unexciting and not par-
ticularly noteworthy. Although consistently requesting sea duty,
the closest approach to it was assignment to the staff of Com-
mander, Destroyers in the Atlantic, much to the pleasure and
gratification of my wife, and later to a newly commissioned heavy
cruiser two or three months before V-J Day.

Have always maintained my interest in Harvard and many of
its varied activities. Although not the nostalgic type, am forever
mindful and aware of the values, friendships and contacts made
as an undergraduate. Have also been connected with various
civic and charitable organizations in and around Boston, and can
truthfully say that whatever small contributions have been do-
nated in these fields have been, not from a sense of obligation or
responsibility, but from personal pleasure. Am a registered Re-
publican, but like to think of myself as being an open-minded
Independent and have frequently split my ballot based on my con-
viction on the abilities of the candidates involved.

Familywise, my life has been a most happy one and I have been
blessed with exceptional good luck. Many vacations have been
spent “en famille”; two automobile trips across the continent and
one in Italy, three or four cruises along the coast of Maine in a
chartered boat, a ranch in Montana with Classmate Bliss, summer

[ 1226 ]

cottages on the seashore. But have also cruised with Mary and
contemporaries in the Caribbean and West Indies and have taken

another trip to Europe when the children were ensconced in
school.

Athletics and varied outdoor activities continue to play a major
role in my recreational time.

concerns itself with corporate tax and estate law matters. Much
of my corporate practice involves membership on the board of
directors of medium size companies engaged in the international
field, which I find very interesting and challenging.

Since World War II, we have lived in White Plains, New York,
which gives some relaxation, at least on weekends, from the
turmoil of New York City. We have three children, William
III (Ricky) who is 12, David, age 6, and our recent arrival,
Susan, who is all of one.

I have become fairly interested in community affairs over the
past years and, in addition to spending considerable time with
various charitable organizations, I have spent a fair amount of
my non-office time working for the Democratic Party. In 1954
I was the unsuccessful candidate for the New York State Senate
from my district in Westchester County, and I am still active
during campaign time and between campaigns on the Executive
Committee and as Finance Chairman of our local Democratic City
Committee.

My main hobby continues as it was in college, philatelics, which
my son, Ricky, shares with great enthusiasm, and bridge, which
Nancy has recently taken to and which I hope to teach the boys
shortly. Nancy and I both are confirmed travellers, and although
we spend our summers on the New Jersey seashore, we usually
find some time to travel to more distant places, and preferably to
more tropical climates, We are avid tennis players, but I am afraid
that at this point in life, golf is beginning to beckon strongly,

HOW to summarize an affair that runs from Harvard °33 to
Georgia (tutoring); then back home to Hawaii and a career in
the pineapple industry, rudely interrupted by the draft and the
Southwest Pacific campaign; then back home to war-torn
Hawaii; then off again in a few years to Korea and service as
chaplain; to the present brief time out for the graduate degree in
business administration at the University of California?

They have been years full of events and hazards, thrills and
chills; and to find oneself right side up and still in the fight is
cause for some thoughtful consideration. All this plus a lovely,
talented, and capable wife, and a sparkling, blue-eyed blonde
Mouseketeer of five and one-half years —jet-propelled and full
of irrepressible enthusiasm.

There were the days of the thirties — days of freedom and
progress in the pineapple industry, unworried and unhurried by
the onrushing military crises; happy days in Hawaii, Then came
the morning when we looked up and saw the Zeros with the
strange red circle insignia, and columns of black oil smoke rising
slowly in the lazy morning air over Pearl Harbor.

After training in the States, my division was on its way to the
Pacific, with a few months in Hawaii for jungle and amphibious
training. What a break—home for Christmas! During pauses
between exercises there was time for social affairs, and at ene of
these I met my future wife, who had just arrived in the Islands.

The Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor gave us plenty of oppor-
tunity to use what we had learned. When the Eighth Army teok
over in Yokohama, a major and myself constituted the economics
section of the Military Government Command, with the mission
of getting the whole economy of northern Japan and Hokhaide
back into operation. One never-to-be-forgortten thrill (after

[ 1229 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

having been bombed at Pearl) was sailing into Tokyo Bay a few
days after V-J Day and seeing the Stars and Stripes planted
majestically on a conspicuous promontory at the entrance.

Marriage came the year I returned to Hawaii and the pine-
apple industry. After a couple of years in comparative quiet,
I found myself back in the service, and by the time I was needed
in Korea, I qualified as Protestant chaplain. Thanksgiving, 1950,
was celebrated on the banks of the Yalu River at the Man-
churian border. (Really not so cold after Boston.) This little
affair finally wound up with the slugfest at Heart-break Ridge,
where I finally collected enough points for rotation home.

The hectic, challenging days at Fort Ord, California, recruit
training center of the West, were completed with a mutual
agreement by the Army and myself that things had gone far
enough. During this time, our little Mouseketeer arrived. Op-
portunity that for some time had evaded me, of taking some
time out for a graduate degree in business administration, was
presented, and 1 am making the best of it. This is in a sense like
Harvard, a place of high purpose, and constantly rising standards.
It rates second to Harvard now in scholarship of faculty. The
experience of returning to classrooms has been a rousing one,
opening vistas of fresh new outlook—certainly one to be re-
commended to mellow and refurbish concepts, ideas, and ideals.

There is reason for some encouragement in these days of chal-
lenges on all fronts, that there are religious movements of univer-
sal scope that are dedicated to the welfare and well-being of all
mankind. It is a privilege and inspiration to have a significant
part in one of them.

My hobbies are ceramics and writing, Sports are golf, tennis
and swimming.

I DON’T know why it should be so hard to write “the account

of my life.” Have put it off to the last deadline, so it is now

or never. Will state the facts without literary embellishment.

After College I enjoyed three more years in Cambridge with
many of our classmates at the Law School. Then back to Port-
land and into law practice in the firm founded by my grand-
father. I have been a partner since 1940. I specialize to a large
extent (but not exclusively) in admiralty and maritime law. It
is interesting, enjoyable and supports me.

During World War II years I was in Washington, D.C., first
with the U.S. War Shipping Administration and later commis-
sioned in the Navy. While with W.S.A., I was director of Small
Vessels Procurement, in charge of a division which requisitioned
all types of vessels under 1000 tons (tugs, barges, fishing craft —
perhaps your yacht, if you had one) for the Army, Navy and
Coast Guard. Later I was chairman of the W.S.A. Committee
on Just Compensation, responsible for negotiating awards of com-
pensation to owners of the big passenger liners —such as the
Matson, Grace Line and U.S. Line ships — requisitioned for the
war. Since the war I have continued in private law practice in
Portland. .

I have no time for golf, what with deer-hunting and upland
birds in early fall, duck shooting in the late fall, winter stecllicad
fishing and fly-fishing for trout in spring and summer. Also still
try to ski a little at Mt. Hood, and occasionally to Sun Valley
with the children who have long since left me far behind on the
slopes.

IF I were chronologically minded at the moment, I would, of
course, start this narrative with the year 1933. I prefer, however,
to recount the events since graduation in the order of their im-
portance to me. Naturally, therefore, I shall start with my mar-
riage to Edna O’Nan Ruby and her three boys (ours now) on
October 27, 1956. When you see her—and them — come Re-
union time, you'll know why I waited so long! Yes, quite a few
changes have been wrought in my personal life and habits since

[ 1232]

October, 1956. For example, I don’t seem to know much now.
adays about what’s in the morning paper! But on the other hand
if you want to know anything about first grade reading, third
grade spelling or eighth grade math — just ask me. Well, perhaps
you'd better subtract the eighth grade math, for it is, after all,
rather difficult, and the eighth grade was a long while ago!

Next in order of importance, but not so joyful, in fact, not
joyful at all, was April 15, 1942. On that date I headed for Ft.
Schuyler in the Bronx to begin my indoctrination as an ensign in
the United States Navy. As was undoubtedly true with most of the
millions of others, I had a deep sense of duty and responsibility
on that day which was nicely mixed with pride. Nothing that
happened during the next four years detracted from that feeling.
After tours of duty in New York City and at the Naval Air Sta-
tions in Fortalega, Brazil, and Pomona, New Jersey, I was hon-
orably discharged as a lieutenant, senior grade. I still retain my
Reserve status.

I remember well January 16, 1946. That was the first day back
at the office. I was starting out again in the practice of law, except
this time I was in an entirely new field, patent law instead of the
general practice. Before the war I had never really known what
a patent lawyer was for, nor what he did. But an opportunity
to find out had presented itself, and since the firm in which I
had been a partner before the war was no longer in existence, I was
free to accept. In truth I “grabbed”at the opportunity! It was
tough the first few years because of the necessity of taking a
Patent Bar Exam that was much more difficult than the State Bar
had been and because of its being a very technical and exacting
field. Fortunately, however, I have never once regretted the
decision, and the practice has been most rewarding in all respects.

Then there are a lot of other dates that have had significance
to me, but the exact day, month or year seems somchow to have
escaped me. However, the exact dates were really unimportant.
The important thing to me was the fine sense or feeling that at-
tended the giving of my time and services to worthwhile things
such as the church, the various agencies of the Community Chest
and the like. These experiences too have been very rewardin:,
but of course in the spiritual sense. "

If my next twenty-five years (God willing) are as challengins

[ 1233]

a

and as enriching in the true sense as the last twenty-five, I shall
be very thankful, And with a new and wonderful wife and three
vigorous, healthy boys, I think I’m going to be most thankful.

BY the time I graduated from the Business School I had reached
the conviction that it would be a fine thing for a young man
whose entire background lay in Boston to get a broader base of
experience for a year or two before settling down. I specified
accordingly to my prospective employer who responded by mov-
ing me to Providence. That firm had some trouble so I found a
new employer, this time in Chicago. That firm had some trouble
so I went to work for Procter & Gamble who moved me to
Denver, then Dallas, then Cincinnati. .

Procter & Gamble didn’t have any trouble (and never will),
but the U.S.A. did, so I picked myself a sedentary spot in Army
Intelligence and settled down in Cleveland for the duration,
then Washington. That particular branch of the service had
some trouble so I found another, equally sedentary, the Army
Foreign Claims Section of JAGD. So I again settled down for
the duration, in Casablanca, then Algiers, then Constantine, then
Tunis, then Ajaccio, then Florence.

By 1946 I figured my year or two broader base was complete
but I had lost touch with Boston. So I went to work for a bank
in New York. Not long afterward, | got married (about time,

[ 1234 ]

too), took a long look ahead at myself rearing a family in that
foul place, and in no time at all was back in Boston, living first
in Chestnut Hill, then in Dover.

Was that all? Three years later I was back working in New
York, living in Greenwich, then New Canaan. No soap. An-
other three years I was back working in Boston, living in Dover
again, now Dedham. My wife says, “That's that.”

To anybody with a broad view of life and its possibilities
Boston is just plain backwater. (Except for Harvard.) But for
all my travels I didn’t get broadened at all. I like working on
State Street and I like living in Dedham even though the road
to California doesn’t go through Dedham any more. (It gocs
through Newton.)

And I like the idea that my children will get stuffed with
traditional ideas and values as they go through the traditional
schools of this area, even though they will eventually gag with
disgust when they find out how much better things are every-
where else.

So this time it’s for keeps. Although it’s a funny thing. The
other night after a bottle of Veuve Clicquot (we find that Veuve
Clicquot makes us feel young again; you know what I mean),
my wife said to me, “Wouldn’t it be wonderful to live out
West.”

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

AFTER graduating reported for duty at one of the accepted
New York banks. “Three squares and a flop” however made a
big dent on an embryonic banker’s pocketbook and I struck out
for more lucrative pay dirt. Harvard’s gift to the Democratic
Party was going strong in those years and the going was rough.
Finally decided to return to New England and take up school
teaching. Had no sooner settled down to the proverbial school-
master’s life of celibacy and all the rest when the war came.
Was commissioned lieutenant (j.g.), U.S.N.R., and stationed at
Fort Mifflin, Philadelphia. Finally got to sea on attack transport
and took command of “the beach party.” We participated in
the Iwo and Okinawa landings and shuttled back and forth
bringing the troops into Japan.

During this brief interlude of Navy life I managed to marry
a Boston lass and start a modest family of two daughters. Re-
turned to Boston after the fracas and got a job with Kidder
Peabody & Company as a salesman. I am still there and find the
investment banking business as intriguing as ever.

The ménage was increased by an additional daughter, Louise,
born in 1949. Having been brought up in an all male family, I
find the distaff side of life still rather perplexing. We live quite
happily, however, in Chestnut Hill surrounded by good Repub-
licans and Unitarians.

I did serve two terms as town meeting member and am still
being tapped to collect funds for every worthy cause. My po-
litical beliefs are that the Republicans still have something more
constructive to offer than the Democrats.

I happened to write some lyrics for the church show last
year. The chorus of one song went:

We're commuters, we're commuters!
We're commuters true, we sing to you,
We never fail, for we all hail

From Harvard, Princeton, Chestnut Hill
And even Yale.

SUMMARIZING one’s life and interests from college days to
the present turns out to be both interesting and challenging. First
there is the development of how I’ve earned my livelihood. This
started with a summer job in a gold mine near Breckenridge, just
west of the Divide in Colorado. When the mine shut down there
was cotton goods manufacturing in Taunton, Massachusetts,
which was good for a year, when it shut down also — and just
before Christmas, too!

With nothing to lose, I set out for California in a Greyhound
bus. There, following the Long Beach earthquake, came real
estate and water heater selling in quick succession. A turn at
sales-engineering of heating and air conditioning came next and
during that time I was married and received my designation for
the Foreign Service exams. The exams, of course, I couldn't accept
because, as you may know, marriage in the first years of For-
eign Service was not allowed.

However, things began to jell when I started in 1940 with Doug-
las Aircraft. There in the engineering department I planned and
scheduled and estimated for ten years in a blacked-our buih ling.
But I still hankered for the outdoors, and so it seemed like a gol
idea to get a change and smell the fresh air ayrain. Farming HY
trigued both Edith and me, and off we went for a year to the
San Joaquin Valley to raise grapes and goats and veyetables
(shades of the “have-more plan”) and our three chil Iren, Que
year up, though we liked farming, we felt that it was necessary
to own your own, This we couldn’ t swing, so back we picked

and settled in San Dimas, a very convenient distance from Po-
mona, where I was soon in harness, this time with Convair and
missiles instead of with Douglas and airplanes.

My last three years there were in the Terrier Project engineer’s
office. All was fine and happy until one day when we were taking
a trip to Mt. San Jacinto, We looked back down from the five
thousand-foot level at the valley where we lived. “Do we really
have to spend our lives down there in that brown soup of a
smog?” Edith asked. “We're happy there. We have a good job
and, I think, future there; but to answer your question — no, not
really.” The upshot of that question (and many previous ones)
is that now I have been transferred to the Astronautics Division
of Convair in San Diego. We have a house in La Jolla (where
I live during the week) and my poor wife is still up in the smog,
trying to sell our San Dimas house.

So much for livelihood. What about interest and activities?
While living in Palos Verdes (during the Douglas period) I was
one of the founders and vice-president of the Civic Group and
spent much time promoting Palos Verdes College as a member
of its advisory council. Later I helped with Boy Scouts and PTA-
type activities. Most fun, I think, has been the vacations we have
taken in the High Sierras with the Sierra Club, hiking, taking
pictures and enjoying the freedom of being away from civiliza-
tion with its rush and bustle. And yet, inexplicably, I feel that

it is this very urgency and complication that intrigues me and
keeps me at my work.

AS I look back on the first twenty-five years following college,
I can not help feeling that I have been particularly fortunate in
enjoying a fairly adventurous life which has provided me with
action and with a feeling of participation in the world’s atTain,
and the promotion of our national interests. First as a mining
engineer, and later as a soldier and diplomat, I have been able
to see much of the world and its people. Furthermore, it has
been possible to share much of this with a lovely wife and four
splendid children.

After five years of mining and prospecting work for a group of
British companies in. the Balkan peninsula (1935-1940), I was
called to active duty to Washington by the Army in the summer
of 1940, and eventually became a professional soldier. The war
years were spent largely in supervising the development and
manufacturing of cannon for our own and our allies’ armies.
After being decorated for this work with the Legion of Merit in
1945, I was sent to Moscow as one of the military attaches at the
American Embassy. This was followed by transfer to the Allied
Control Commission and Sofia, Bulgaria, in 1946, and then by
assignment as the first military attaché to the American Legation
in Bulgaria after World War II. The two youngest children were
born during this period, one in Bulgaria and the other in Turkey.
The most significant thing that happened during this phase of my
career is the development of my interests in geopolitics and ip
macy coupled with an understanding of Communism and i
methods and consequences.

Returning to the U.S. at the end of to949, T was sent to the

[ 1239 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

Detroit Tank Arsenal, where I served briefly as director of labor-
atories, and engaged in scientific and engineering research work.
Fortunately, after three months I was returned to planning and
operational activities in the field of international relations, and
stationed in Washington from 1950 to 1953. In 1952, I was pro-
moted to the grade of full colonel, and transferred to the Depart-
ment of State, which sent me on a diplomatic assignment to
Turkey, where I served until 1954, as attaché in Istanbul. During
the entire period, I was involved in work which required a great
deal of travel in the Mediterranean area and Western Europe,
and which developed my interest in the Middle East.

Following Turkey, I returned to scientific work in Washing-
ton, being assigned to take charge of a unit engaged in research
in the basic sciences and in developing new military applications
for nuclear energy. After something like ten months of this, I
went back, in 1955, to planning and operational work in the geo-
political field, and in 1957 was again sent out by the State Depart-
ment on another diplomatic assignment, this time as attaché to the
American Embassy in Tehran, Iran.

I must say that once having fallen into something of an itin-
erant way of life, one is always tempted to seek new fields to ex-
plore. In some ways this can be a little hard on the children in
the family, but on the whole travel and periodic life abroad does
them more good than harm. In my own case, the family has the
advantage of a couple of permanent bases which provide the chil-
dren with the certain feeling of stability —one being a home in
Chevy Chase, Maryland, and the other our summer home on an
island off the Maine coast.

I have been married for nineteen years, having married Mar-
garet DeLancey Howe (daughter of William DeLancey Howe,
’93) of Cambridge in 1939, after having known her since under-
graduate days. With an A.B. from Vassar and an A.M. from
Radcliffe, her interests used to lie in the field of fine arts; how-
ever, she has now developed a great interest in education, and
particularly in the problems of getting children started off prop-
erly when formal schooling first begins.

aratory school (St. Albans, Washington, D.C.) to complete be-
fore he reaches the college stage. The younger two are still at
ages at which they can be moved around fairly easily and will
join me in Tehran with their mother.

As far as hobbies go, besides wife and children, I can fist
mountain-climbing on a modest scale, riding, hunting, sailing, ten-
nis and reading. Iran happens to be a place where there are exccl-
lent outlets for all of these except for the sailing and reading.
The general lack of water precludes sailing in this arid land,
while the rigours of diplomatic life reduce the time available for
reading to a rather unsatisfactory minimum.

When living at home, both my wife and I prefer Washington,
D.C., where we have numerous friends, where the social life 1s
stimulating and where we can use our Chevy Chase house. As
for the summers, we try to spend as much time as we can on
the island off the Maine coast, where it is possible to get awav
from it all, and where it takes Washington two days to reach
me in order to call me back before my leave is up.

Socially and politically, I find myself generally assigned to
the right side of the socio-political spectrum, and my friends
frequently seem to think that I stand somewhere between Taft
and Louis XIV. The latter is something of an exaggeration, of
course, but my own evaluation is “conservative.” As far as
religious preferences go, | am an Episcopalian.

In conclusion, I find that after twenty-five years of practical
experience in the cold, hard world I am more certain than ever
that one of the greatest assets a man can have is a Harvard educa-

tion, which goes a long way to make the world less cold and
hard, imparts a certain flexibility to Harvard men in terms of
capacity to accept responsibility and meet new challenges, and
permits us to get so much more out of life.

THE life I look back upon seems to unfold in four chapters,
each containing a collection of related events and expericaces,
The first began in June, 1933, with the drive home after a vic-
torious boat race against Yale and the realization that this Last
act as an undergraduate closed one absorbing chapter, but
opened others, as yet unimagined. Teaching was my father’s
vocation; there was an opening on the faculty of the Thacher
School, Ojai, California, my preparatory school; so I became

a teacher.

Two years of boarding school life were enough in spite of
the pleasure of learning a profession from sympathetic people in
familiar surroundings. I returned to Cambridge, which, I dss-
covered, exerted an irresistible pull then as now, and joined the
faculty of the Shady Hill School. Here I met the lady who be-
came my wife and whose two daughters, aged one and four
at the time of our marriage, augmented in pleasant and often
baffling ways the experience I was getting in the teaching of
young children. Here also I acquired a profound respect for
the work of Miss Katherine Taylor, director of the school, and
her faculty; a respect which continues to this day.

Four years passed. The work was absorbing, ‘but so tee was
the country’s struggle to shake off the Depression. The New
Deal was a fascinating structure, Roosevelt a heroic fi iwure whe
dramatized the plight of one-third of the nation and the South
in particular. We decided to work in the South and add whit
skills we possessed to the process of recovery. We little realred
as we left Cambridge in the fall of 1939, carrying our belongs
behind us in a trailer, how completely immersed in another
region we would become.

The second chapter contains a cluster of vivide memories af
five years of rural education in North Carolina and Crcorsrss
This was accomplished through a farmers’ cooperative and erett
union in North Carolina, a position as secretary of a lea: sue of

[ 1243 ]

HARVARD CLASS OF 1933

co-ops throughout the South, and an assistant professorship at
the University of Georgia. In this capacity I helped to train
rural school teachers in some of the techniques of school-and-
community relations and in a philosophy of education that in-
cluded an understanding of the economy and cultural patterns
of the area. I learned far more than I taught in the school dis-
tricts of western Georgia, but thanks to the assistance of the
Julius Rosenwald Fund, together with unusually far-sighted
leadership at the University, some excellent work was done
among parents and teachers of those districts. Schools that had
been all but abandoned were revived, and with them were re-
vived the hopes, health and confidence of several thousand coun-
try youngsters who by now, one believes, are better adults for
the experience. _

During these years I had acquired a degree of experience in
the formation and management of rural cooperatives: credit
unions, purchasing, processing and marketing co-ops. An offer to
become secretary of a unit of a national farm organization in
New Jersey and Pennsylvania promised more opportunity for
this type of adult education. I accepted. First as secretary, then
as president of the Eastern Division of the National Farmers
Union, I directed an extensive, open-air college. There were
long drives at night to meetings, many visits with farmers in
fields, in barns and in kitchens. I was used to this, but this time
it was on a scale that covered two states. Our co-ops ground
feed in carload lots and sold milk, butter and eggs by the truck-
load. We broke the black market in Philadelphia for a few weeks
in 1945 by selling butter and eggs at ceiling prices and collected
ten thousand signatures on a petition to save the OPA. City
people found it hard to believe that many farmers were more
interested in stability than a quick profit.

Those were exciting and strenuous years from 1944 to 1949;
but our children were in need of better schools, and we were
ready for a longer-range occupation, after our numerous changes.
Fortune smiled at the proper time and I accepted an invitation
to return to Cambridge — that pull again —as director of Shady
Hill School. The nine years that we have spent here since then
have been no less colorful or interesting for being lived on fa-
miliar ground. The experiences of the South and of the Farmers

Union seem to blend with those of the earlier days in the Went,
each adding some flavor of its own to the present. Not the least
of these is the proximity of Harvard and the opportunity to at-
tend a class in Sever Hall, feeling much younger than one appears
in the cursory glance of a hurrying undergraduate.

Both daughters are married to teachers. One lives in Teheran,
the other in Vermont. We are very proud and a little startled
to be grandparents. The son is a senior in Milton and has applicd
— where else? —to Harvard. I noticed on his application that
several work-a-day professions were listed as being desirable,
followed by the word “adventurer.” I felt glad to see this word
so used. —

My principal out-of-school delight is playing cello in an
amateur string quartet and listening to symphony and chamber
music concerts; while in summer there is no greater pleasure
than a family cruise among the Elizabeth Islands or along the
coast of Maine. One has much to be thankful for. Living in
the shadow of Harvard, and still a part-time graduate student.
I find myself especially grateful for the wise liberalism of the
Harvard tradition. May it prosper and invigorate us all at our
Reunion.

MORE or less by accident I settled myself in Washington about
twenty years ago, and now I am spoiled for living anywhere
else. It has been an exciting place to live, always providing new
friends who represent a wide variety of interests and activities.
Sometimes I feel that I get a conversational overdose of politics
and public affairs, but I wouldn’t change it for a diet of talk
about the stock market or the advertising business.

As a place to practise architecture, Washington offers mixed
blessings. The absence of industry eliminates one type of activ-
ity which keeps architects busy in many other cities. But the
Government is a useful, if sometimes exasperating client. Much
of my work has been for the Army and Navy, the Bureau of
Standards, the U. S. Information Agency, and other branches of
the Federal Government, but my partner and I have also de-
signed a good many private houses, a couple of schools, and
various commercial buildings. Our most interesting projects,
technically, have been the Voice of America’s new headquart-
ers in Washington and an Army Communications Center for
the eastern United States at Fort Detrick, Maryland. Some of
the other buildings have given us a chance to do things which
were most satisfying aesthetically. What I feel the lack of
most strongly is a good business manager who would free me
to sit at a drafting board all day. This is a common occupational
complaint.

I decided long before I left (or even entered) college, that
Y would never make a name for myself as a great athlete, and
my prediction has been glowingly justified. I occasionally get
around the golf course in a hundred or over, and I can still beat
my thirteen and one-half-year-old daughter at tennis, but the
gap is rapidly closing. In spite of my wife’s tears and pleading,
I refuse to play bridge. Life is just too short.

One of my greatest pleasures has been occasional travelling.
We have been abroad three times since the war, visiting American

[ 1246 ]

or English friends, looking at architecture, and sight-seeing gen-
erally. F riends made in Washington, both foreign and domestic,
are likely to be transient. Most of the time this i is a misfortune,
but when you travel abroad it has its compensations. Every
foreign capital has a large quota of Old Washington Faces.

As for politics, I think of myself as an independent voter, but
before I became a disenfranchised citizen of the District of Co-
lumbia I always seemed to find myself voting Democratic. |
was disappointed that Stevenson wasn’t elected, and the record
of the present administration has not changed my mind. Living
in Washington has given me a good deal of respect for the top-
ranking civil servants in the Foreign Service, but no use for the
system which gives the juiciest Foreign Service jobs to political
appointees. That’s not a partisan complaint because both parties
have been guilty.

I have never had more than momentary regrets about decid-
ing to be an architect. I spent three years at Yale after leaving
Cambridge, years which I thoroughly enjoyed. After grad-
uation from architectural school I went abroad for a few months
of wandering, and came home to find the offer of a job in Chi-
cago waiting for me — fifteen dollars a week! I had made more
money before ever studying architecture, but I was glad to
have a job which didn’t require me to pay for the priv ilege of
working; that sometimes happened in those days. I rose at a
meteoric rate to a salary of twenty-five dollars a w eck, after
which I was fired because the work had run out — something
that is always happening in architects’ offices. Several other
jobs followed, first in Chicago, then in Washington, before 1
decided to go into business for myself. The war nipped that
after a year and started me on a new track.

To say the very least, there must have been a good many
people who contributed more to winning the war than I dud.
I enlisted in the Corps of Engineers, and after six healthy months
as a private and officer candidate at Fort Belvoir, I was com-
missioned a second lieutenant and kept on as an instructor in
the Engineer School. Then in 1944 I was extracted from the
Corps of Engineers by OSS. There I followed the usual pre-
cedure —an intensive course of training for duty in the Far
East, followed promptly by assignment to Europe. LT saw a prod

deal of France and Belgium, and spent a delightful month in
London at the very end of the war, with no responsibilities except
to ask once a day if any orders had arrived. A few months later
I wrote a very flattering report on my own services and quali-
fications, recommended myself highly for a promotion to captain,
and departed from the Army, not much wiser but certainly
poorer. By that time I felt that Washington was home, and I
opened my own office as soon as I got out of uniform.

On the whole, this is a wonderful time to be an architect.
Bad as is much of the architecture that we’re producing today,
I think the best contemporary buildings will be ranked high
by future generations. It’s a time of experiment and new ideas,
out of which I am sure an even more important architecture will
develop. It’s fun to be a part of the process.

DURING my last two undergraduate years I worked part time
for Tidewater Oil Company. At graduation, therefore, due to
the needs of the depression, I decided to devote full time to learn-
ing the oil business at the retail level. This gave some experience
in salesmanship which was extremely valuable when, in 1935, a
friend and I started an enterprise to provide business firms and
homes with interior decorating service. At that time such a pur-
suit did not appear indispensable. It has been gratifying to observe

{ 1248 |

over the years, however, that the public and industry have Icarned
the satisfaction which attractive design and materials can afford.

There are certain advantages attached to being in business
for yourself. There’s a‘lot of hard work too, with extra time
put in on Sundays and holidays. I guess the latter was a factor
in my decision to get into a bigger organization. So, after a
careful look around, I joined my present employer, the Liberty
Mutual Insurance Company, in 1938. This was followed by
marriage and settling down to suburban living.

The war affected everyone, of course. The real change for
me came with active Naval duty at the start of 1943. The usual
program of indoctrination and training was followed by assign-
ment to a small amphibious ship. We managed to stay out of
serious trouble while making ourselves useful to bigger and
more important units of the fleet in the Pacific. After the his-
toric ceremony aboard the Missouri, various duty assignments
permitted time for sightseeing in Japan, the Philippines, French
Indo-China and the southeastern coast of China. This was per-
haps the high point of my life. I made full use of the privileges
afforded a commanding officer to visit every possible spot, includ-
ing some not shown on our charts.

April, 1946, brought return to home and job. Liberty Mutual
soon sent me to its San Francisco office. This has been the focal
point of a widening circle of friends. In the past few years
there have been a few dominant interests. The first led to study,
exams, and receipt in 1952 of the designation Chartered Prop-
erty and Casualty Underwriter. Contact with other designees
has proved stimulating. Naval Reserve activities have been the
principal hobby. Assignments in a nearby Electronics Division
include training officer, executive officer and commanding of-
ficer. Like most suburbanites, I find “do it yourself” projects
seem to come along regularly. A natural disinclination for work
has not interfered with education in concrete work, brick laying
or even roofing. My wife and I have become enthusiastic con-
verts to California, and occasional trips back to New Fryglind
haven’t shaken our belief that this is the place for us.

As to job, the primary requirements for the practice of public
accounting is an attitude of independence of mind. In an ave
of conformity, I find this appealing. ‘The wide range of the prob-
lems faced daily and the intimate contacts with varied types of
business and institution are a source of constant fascination to one
who is curious to know what really makes the economic wheels
go round. ‘I'wenty-two years have seen tremendous growth in
the areas dealt with by this profession and in the recognition of
its contributions to business and public life. I have ridden with
this tide and found satisfaction in the work. As in any worth-
while occupation, the demands upon time and energy have been
heavy.

As for. family, we five are too rough-edged ever to achicve
the current ideal of togetherness. Marjorie and I attempt, against
a counterpoint of hacking and TV, to stretch young minds to
receive new ideas and to provide opportunity for creative art
and music. We hope, in the process, that we are keeping our
own minds receptive to new ideas, new art, new music. We do a
little family skiing, some sailing and cruising, some hiking and
camping. Perhaps the last is the most important as it passes on
the arts of survival upon which the atomic generation will pre-
sumably have to depend.

AFTER graduating from the Tufts Medical School in 1937, I
proceeded to spend the next five years at the Jewish Hospital of
Brooklyn, Boston Lying-In and the Free Hospital for Women,
Brookline. At these three institutions, I acquired the technical
facilities and developed the maturity of judgment necessary in
obstetrics and gynecology. But alas! What happened to that
amazing vitality with which I was endowed at that time? How
relatively easy it was to play nine, even eighteen holes of golf
after devilishly long hours of sustained work. Now, it behooves
one to charter a golf buggy to traverse the same terrain that the
pedal extremities would so spritely negotiate.

Having completed my professional training, I quickly sought
a commission in the Army to help terminate the conflict in which
we were embroiled. My first fifteen months, however, were spent
traveling from one station to another. We traveled from Ports-
mouth, New Hampshire, to Pennsylvania, to New York, to New
Jersey, Alabama and Georgia. Finally, I was assigned to Fort
McClellan as the Post Obstetrician and the next three years were
spent acting as Accoucheur to the dependents of the Army per-
sonnel, This was entitled the Battle of Alabama.

Then came the return to civilian life in 1946. We sought haven
in this lovely community of Hartford, seeking to escape the
frenzy of the big cities and the bustle that we had encountered
in Army life. The practice of medicine, however, consumes too
many hours and the meetings associated with it occupy so many
evenings that one is hard-pressed for time to spend with the fam-
ily or friends, or to pursue one’s hobbies. Periodic vacations seem

to be the answer and to these we look forward with great an-
ticipation.

25TH ANNIVERSARY REPORT

together a convenient time to try to weave a personal fabric of
the last quarter of a century. This and the even more con-
venient goading of the class secretary, who is, incidentally, the
most remarkably amiable prodder I have known, have stimulated
the following peregrination.

To most travelers, Providence and Rhode Island are synony-
mous, Providence being the last stop on the main line New Haven
run from New York to Boston, and the first stop southward on
the return trip. I have had ample occasion to find differently,
having spent the past eleven years teaching zoology at the Uni-
versity of Rhode Island in Kingston. The university (SIX Vears
ago, Rhode Island State College) is in the southern. part of the
state, a typically rugged New England countryside, displaying
calm variety at all seasons, an ideal site for an ecologist like
myself.

After graduating in the spring of 1933, I landed a job as as-
sistant director of the Bass Biological Laboratory in Englewood
on the west coast of Florida. -It was both a novel and an enrich-
ing experience, especially for one who had never been south
of Philadelphia, and I soon discovered how very foolish were
the sheep who wintered on the east coast compared with the
goats who had far more pleasant pasturage on the west coast
of that state. In the summer of 1934 I took off for Scandinavia,
assisting in the investigation of a shellfisheries problem, at the
same time managing a great deal of sightseeing, mostly in Den-
mark. It is a sturdy country, and its people are truly magnin-
cent. Before returning home, I spent a week in Paris — the older
boys had told me so much about it, I had to find out for mysclt
how right they were.

The following year was spent as a graduate student at Har-
vard. In many ways it was confusing: I was trying to follow
a program in biology and at the same time live with a group of
Jaw students. Verbal communication was not only ditficule but
sometimes practically impossible! The next two years were
spent at Rhode Island State College (ah, those coeds), and in
June, 1937, I had an S.M. To many the next step in my career
will bring a shudder; to others, more worldly wise, a raved eve:
brow; and to myself, a complete appreciation of the superiority
of the facultative parasites of Harvard Square to the obhirire

wise it is lower. It still seems that anything and anybody, truth
and fellowman, may be sacrificed for a “story”: the fanning
of hysteria during the McCarthy trials and the fostering of the
competitive spirit about Sputnik, as if satellite production and
inside operations are games, are cases in point. To this are added
the downright falsehoods and nonsense of the advertising pro-
fession. Their efforts are grossly misleading with automobiles,
cigarettes, and cosmetics, but have reached a nadir in the ad-
vertising schemes of large companies who at present by means
of a suggestion technique promote Asian flu rather than its
cure. This attempt at mass hypnosis is both horrible and out-
rageous. It is little wonder that perceptive leaders in higher
education, as well as other critics of the current social scene, are
profoundly concerned about an observed trend towards increased
“anti-intellectualism” among our college and university students.
I feel that this situation is in great part the result of the mediocre
mass production in mediocre mass media. To raise the student
from this educational abyss will take the combined effort of
teacher, parents, and home environment. It is not too soon to
start now.

Finally, because of my interests in teaching and in ecology, |
have become vitally concerned with the conservation of our
natural resources. This is an area of far-reaching sociological
and economic importance to all of us who have to endure the
stress and strain of our crowded, fast-moving, highly mechanized
and raucously noisy civilization. I feel deeply that democracy
and effective conservation carry with them the obligations of
hard work by individuals and social alertness. They have been
tried and have been found to be beyond price. It should be
obvious that we must have the fullest confidence that these
processes will bring an increasingly rich manner of living for all.
If we are to survive we must support them actively.

Am already looking forward to our Fiftieth!

THERE is a certain finality about the Twenty-fifth Reunion Re-
port, since this is the last chance to immortalize one’s self in print.
Worst of all, the necessity for reviewing the intervening years
brings about the grim realization that a whole generation has
passed. Who could be flippant or witty at a time like this?

For me, life after leaving Harvard was mostly a struggle for
economic survival, accomplished by bookkeeping and accounting.
Eventually, the defense program created a need for industrial en-
gineers and I spent several years in the shipbuilding and aircraft
industries. ‘Then came two years in the Army, in work simplitica-
tion and personnel control. After separation, I returned to con-
sulting management engineering first in Boston, then Birmingham,
Alabama, and finally the West Coast. After traveling from Sas

Diego to Seattle, we decided to settle down in Los Angeles. At
the time of our last Report, I was doing industrial engineering for
Leach Relay Company and felt that there would be no future
changes to report. Unexpectedly, a former client, West Coast
Fast Freight, needed a district manager in Seattle. As Leach Relay
had changed hands, we decided to go north (instead of west).
Unfortunately, the jinx of corporate mergers followed us. After
several pleasant years in Seattle, West Coast Fast Freight was ab-
sorbed by another concern and we decided to return to Los An-
geles. 1 am now working for Transcon Lines, a transcontinental
carrier which is busy buying other lines, not selling out.

We are glad to be back in Los Angeles. While we don’t regret
our Seattle interlude, it will take quite an inducement for us to
leave again. Our only regret is the inability of attending the
Twenty-fifth Reunion. Consequently, this is the only opportunity
to express appreciation to classmates, individually and collectively,
for those bygone years.

		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> The Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS) was
 designed to provide comprehensive information on various aspects of
 postsecondary education in the United States and its territories
 (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the
 Marshall Islands) and Department of Defense schools outside the United
 States. The HEGIS Fall Enrollment Component for 1985 sought enrollment
 data from 3,388 institutions of higher education in 50 states,
 Washington, DC, and outlying territories and gave counts of total
 enrollments by class level, number of full-time and part-time male and
 female students enrolled at various levels (graduate, undergraduate,
 etc.), sex, race, calendar system, type of accreditation, attendance
 status (full-time versus part-time), and enrollments of first-time
 students. All of these data are acquired in terms of head counts and
 full-time equivalents, by state. These data are required by agencies
 of the legislative and executive branches of state and federal
 governments, as well as by accrediting agencies, professional
 organizations, and a number of individual institutions interested in
conducting comparative studies.</span></p>

		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> The Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS)
series was designed to provide comprehensive information on various
aspects of postsecondary education in the United States and its
territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,
and the Marshall Islands) and Department of Defense schools outside
the United States. Data are available for both public and private
two-year and four-year institutions. The HEGIS Fall Enrollment
component for 1976 sought enrollment data from 3,073 institutions of
higher education. The data file contains up to three record types for
each institution, and offers information on total enrollments of
full-time and part-time students by class level, sex, race, and
first-time enrollment status, as well as information on the
institutions' type of accreditation, type of calendar system, total
number of students, full-time credit hour load, number of part-time
students reported, number of part-time credits reported, and total
credits for all students.</span></p>

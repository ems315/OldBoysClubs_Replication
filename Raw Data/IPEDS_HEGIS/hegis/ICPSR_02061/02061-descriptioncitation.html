		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> The Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS)
 series was designed to provide comprehensive information on various
 aspects of postsecondary education in the United States and its
 territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,
 and the Marshall Islands) and Department of Defense schools outside
 the United States. The HEGIS Fall Enrollment Component for 1973 sought
 enrollment data from 3,015 institutions of higher education both
 public and nonpublic (2-and 4-year) which is the only survey giving a
 national count of the numbers of students enrolled in these
 institutions. The data collected from the 50 states, District of
 Columbia, and outlying territories give counts of total enrollments by
 class level, sex, race, calendar system, type of accreditation,
 attendance status (full time vs. part time) and enrollments of first
 time students. All of these data are acquired in terms of head counts
and full time equivalents, by state.</span></p>

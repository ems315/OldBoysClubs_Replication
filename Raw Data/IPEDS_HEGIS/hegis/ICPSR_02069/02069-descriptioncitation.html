								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> The Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS)
 series was designed to provide comprehensive information on various
 aspects of postsecondary education in the United States and its
 territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,
 and the Marshall Islands) and Department of Defense schools outside
 the United States. Data are available for both public and private
 two-year and four-year institutions. The HEGIS Fall Enrollment
 component for 1981 sought enrollment data from 3,294 institutions of
 higher education. Key data elements include number of full-time and 
 part-time students by class level, sex, and race, as well as total 
 number of students. Additional data include the institutions' type of
accreditation and type of calendar system.</span></p>

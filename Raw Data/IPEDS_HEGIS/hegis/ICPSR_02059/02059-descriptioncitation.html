		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> The Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS)
 series was designed to provide comprehensive information on various
 aspects of postsecondary education in the United States and its
 territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,
 and the Marshall Islands) and Department of Defense schools outside
 the United States. Data are available for both public and private
 two-year and four-year institutions. The HEGIS Fall Enrollment
 component for 1971 sought enrollment data from 2,893 institutions of
 higher education. Key data elements, presented for up to eight record
 types for each institution, include total enrollments of full-time and
 part-time students by class level, sex, race, and first-time
 enrollment status, as well as information on the institutions' type of
accreditation, type of calendar system, and total number of students.</span></p>

		        		<h2>Scope of Project:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Data Collection Notes:</strong> (1) The HEGIS Record Layout file (Part 2) is an Excel
 worksheet of record layouts for all components of the HEGIS survey,
 including the 1971 Fall Enrollment component. (2) This collection has
 not been processed by ICPSR staff. ICPSR is distributing the data and
 documentation for this collection in essentially the same form in
 which they were received. When appropriate, hardcopy documentation has
 been converted to machine-readable form and variables have been
 recoded to ensure respondents' anonymity. (3) The codebook and user
 guide are provided as a Portable Document Format (PDF) file. The PDF
 file format was developed by Adobe Systems Incorporated and can be
 accessed using PDF reader software, such as the Adobe Acrobat
 Reader. Information on how to obtain a copy of the Acrobat Reader is
provided through the ICPSR Website on the Internet.</span></p>

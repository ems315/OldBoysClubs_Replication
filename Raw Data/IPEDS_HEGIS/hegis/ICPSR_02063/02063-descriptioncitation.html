		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> The Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS)
 series was designed to provide comprehensive information on various
 aspects of postsecondary education in the United States and its
 territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,
 and the Marshall Islands) and Department of Defense schools outside
 the United States. Data are available for both public and private
 two-year and four-year institutions. The HEGIS Fall Enrollment
 component for 1975 sought enrollment data from institutions of higher
 education. Key data elements, presented for up to ten record types for
 each institution, include total enrollments of full-time and part-time
 students by class level and sex, and total number of students,
 first-time students, undergraduates, unclassified students,
first-professional students, and graduate students.</span></p>

		        		<h2>Scope of Project:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Data Collection Notes:</strong> (1) The "Survey Indicator" variable listed in the 
 documentation at column 170 is not used in this survey. (2) The HEGIS 
 Record Layout file (Part 2) is an Excel worksheet of record layouts for 
 all components of the HEGIS survey, including the 1975 Fall Enrollment 
 component. (3) This collection has not been processed by ICPSR staff. 
 ICPSR is distributing the data and documentation for this collection 
 in essentially the same form in which they were received. When 
 appropriate, hardcopy documentation has been converted to machine-readable 
 form and variables have been recoded to ensure respondents' anonymity. 
 (4) The codebook and data instrument are provided as a Portable Document 
 Format (PDF) file. The PDF file format was developed by Adobe Systems 
 Incorporated and can be accessed using PDF reader software, such as the 
 Adobe Acrobat Reader. Information on how to obtain a copy of the Acrobat 
Reader is provided through the ICPSR Website on the Internet.</span></p>

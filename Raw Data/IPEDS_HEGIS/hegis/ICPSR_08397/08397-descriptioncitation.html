		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> The Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS)
series was designed to provide comprehensive information on various
aspects of postsecondary education in the United States and its
territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,
and the Marshall Islands) and Department of Defense schools outside
the United States. Data are available for both public and private
two-year and four-year institutions. The HEGIS Fall Enrollment
component for 1983 sought enrollment data from 3,330 institutions of
higher education. Key data elements, presented for up to 12 record
types for each institution (corresponding to the total enrollments
summary), include number of full-time and part-time students by class
level, sex, and race, as well as total number of students. Additional
data include the institutions' type of accreditation and type of
calendar system.</span></p>

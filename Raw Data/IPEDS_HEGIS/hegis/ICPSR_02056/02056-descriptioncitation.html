		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> The Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS)
series was designed to provide comprehensive information on various
aspects of postsecondary education in the United States and its
territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,
and the Marshall Islands) and Department of Defense schools outside
the United States. Data are available for both public and private
two-year and four-year institutions. The HEGIS Fall Enrollment
component for 1968 sought enrollment data from institutions of higher
education. Key data elements, presented for up to five record types
for each institution, include total enrollments of full-time and
part-time students by class level, sex, race, and first-time
enrollment status, as well as information on the institutions' type of
accreditation, type of calendar system, and total number of students.</span></p>

The original Excel workbook describing the record layouts for the entire HEGIS project, including the 1968 Fall Enrollment data has been removed from DS2 and has been added to DS1 to accompany the dataset. The codebook has been updated., <p>1998-12-17 ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Created variable labels and/or value labels.</li><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></span></p>

These Python, Stata, and R packages are the exact packages that were used
in this project. To ensure exact replication, copy and paste the files within
to the appropriate location on your computer where Python, Stata, and R packages are stored.
Ensure that you are running Python version 3.7.4 when you run the Python cleaning
using the packages contained here. A user may achieve similar results by installing
the requirements_version.txt packages into Python 3.7.4, but minor deviations may occur.
If copying and pasting the Python packages results in error, attempt a pip re-install of the package
that failed with the version as defined in requirements_version.txt.
